0,"MIAMI BEACH, FL — An alleged plan to burn down a large condominium building along the waterfront in Miami Beach was thwarted in what police are describing as a possible hate crime directed toward Jewish residents. A 72-year-old man was taken into custody and police later recovered dozens of filled gasoline containers in the building, according to Ernesto Rodriguez of the Miami Beach Police Department. No one was injured.  Our investigators eventually identified and then actually intercepted the suspect in the parking garage of the building, Rodriguez said Friday. At that moment, he was in possession of two gasoline containers. He had already dumped other containers with gasoline down a trash chute and residents could smell the fumes of gasoline throughout the building.  Subscribe to Miami Beach Patchs free email news alerts and newsletters    Walter Stolper was charged with attempted first degree arson, but may face additional federal offenses. He lives in a 15th floor apartment of the same building he allegedly tried to burn down, the Pavilion condominiums at 5601 Collins Avenue.  But late Friday afternoon, Miami Beach police said that they found an 28 additional containers of gasoline, sulfur powder and potassium nitrate in Stolpers storage room inside the residential high-rise.  Detectives have now charged the defendant with attempted murder, according to Rodriguez. We continue to work with the FBI and State Attorneys Office on this investigation.We remain confident the work of our detectives averted a tragedy.  Rodriguez said that the Miami Beach Fire Department conducted a thorough inspection, mitigated any threat and rendered the building safe. The building did not have to be evacuated.  Court documents said Stolper was pushing a shopping cart with gasoline when he was taken into custody.  As we approached the defendant, we smelled a strong odor of gasoline emitting from the shopping car and the defendants vehicle, court documents said. A total of eight plastic containers filled with gasoline were found in the garbage chute dumpster. Further investigation revealed that these containers had been tossed down the garbage chute.  Miami Beach police said Stolper gave police permission to search his apartment, where they found Nazi books and other items with swastikas on them.  The suspects motivation appears to have been a combination of anger at an upcoming eviction and anger toward fellow residents who are Jewish, Rodriguez said.  He added that the arson charge may be elevated to a hate crime.  We are working closely with the Miami Dade State Attorneys Office who will evaluate this matter for a possible hate crime enhancement, according to Rodriguez.  Police seized a firearm along with two black electrical fans. One witness told police Stolper had shown anger and aggression to fellow residents and the board of directors on multiple occasions.  Stolper allegedly told another resident that he planned to fill plastic containers with gasoline, pour the gasoline down the buildings main drain and then ignite it.  He allegedly planned to use the electrical fans to help spread the flames.  The defendant was interviewed inside his apartment, court documents added. The defendant said I bought the gas to make a small BBQ.  Watch as police recover dozens of gasoline containers from a Miami Beach condo:  Photo courtesy Miami Beach Police Department  ",1,3,1
1,"CHICAGO, IL — A man shown in a viral video harassing a woman for wearing a shirt with the Puerto Rican flag was charged Thursday with a felony hate crime. Timothy G. Trybus, 62, was originally charged with misdemeanor assault and disorderly conduct, but after the Cook County States Attorneys Office reviewed the case, the charges were upgraded to two counts of felony hate crime.  A District of Cook County Forest Preserve Police Officer is seen standing in the background of the video and not intervening. That officer has resigned, officials said.  Mia Irizarry posted the 36-minute video to her Facebook page on June 14, and various versions of it began circulating, stirring outrage worldwide and racking up millions of views. Ricardo Rossello, the governor of Puerto Rico, tweeted that he was appalled, shocked & disturbed by the incident.  The video shows Trybus trying to intimidate Irizarry, and demanding to know why shes wearing a shirt that features the Puerto Rican flag.  You should not be wearing that in the United States of America, Trybus tells her, despite the fact that Puerto Rico is part of the United States — its been a territory of the U.S. since 1898 and a U.S. commonwealth since 1952. Puerto Rican citizens were granted U.S. citizenship in 1917.  The officer can be seen standing in the background of the video, watching the confrontation from several yards away, while Irizarry asks him for help. The officer doesnt appear to respond, and Trybus continues to come closer to the woman and harass her, demanding her citizenship status.  Youre not going to change us, you know that? Trybus tells Irizarry. The world is not going to change the United States of America.  Cook County Commissioner Jesus Chuy Garcia released a statement that said the misdemeanor charges werent enough.  A charge for simple assault or disorderly conduct is not sufficient, this incident must be investigated and charged as a hate crime, Garcia said.  The Cook County Forest Preserves said that the officer who stood in the background of the video was assigned to desk duty while a probe is underway; however, on Wednesday officials said the officer had resigned.  Effective today, Officer Patrick Connor no longer serves in the police department of the Forest Preserves of Cook County, the forest preserve tweeted Wednesday. He resigned late today. But that isnt where our work ends.  In a police report obtained from the Forest Preserve District Police Department, the officer didnt include any mention of the woman asking him for help. In the longer version of the video, the officer told the woman that Trybus didnt pose any threat, and is just a big mouth.  Forest Preserves said Trybus was intoxicated when he was harassing Irizarry.    All people are welcome in the Forest Preserves of Cook County and no one should feel unsafe while visiting our preserves, the agency tweeted.  At a news conference Tuesday afternoon, Forest Preserves Chief of Police Kelvin Pope identified the officer as Patrick Connor. Pope said Connor should have stepped in, and he shouldve done something.  The video was taken in Caldwell Woods on Chicagos Far Northwest Side, according to the Chicago Tribune.

3,"CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA — The man accused of driving through a crowd of peaceful counter-protesters at a Charlottesville white nationalist rally last August, killing one person and injuring several others, has been indicted on hate crime charges, according to the Department of Justice. James Alex Fields Jr., 21, of Maumee, Ohio was indicted on 30 counts, including federal hate crime charges.  Fields was indicted by a federal grand jury in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia in Charlottesville on Wednesday. Fields was charged with one count of a hate crime act resulting in the death of Heather Heyer and 28 counts of of hate crime acts causing bodily injury and involving an attempt to kill.  Heyer, 32, was a paralegal who joined the scores of counter-protesters in Charlottesville last August to demonstrate against the neo-Nazis and white supremacists who descended on the Virginia city to protest the removal of a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee.  Those who knew Heyer described her as compassionate and her mother, Susan Bro, said she had a very strong sense of right and wrong.  Fields was also charged with one count of racially motivated violent interference with a federally protected activity (18 U.S.C. § 245(b)(2)), resulting in the death of Heather Heyer, for driving his car into a crowd of protestors on a downtown street in Charlottesville, Virginia.  The indictment alleges that after an unlawful assembly was declared, Field returned to this car and soon after drove to the vicinity of Fourth and East Market streets in downtown Charlottesville. He then drove his car onto Fourth Street, a narrow, downhill, one-way street, the indictment says. The DOJ says a racially and ethnically diverse crowd was gathered at the bottom of the hill.  Fields slowly proceeded towards the crowd before he stopped and observed them while idling in his car, the indictment alleges.  Many of the individuals in the crowd were chanting and carrying signs promoting equality and protesting against racial and other forms of discrimination, the DOJ said in a press release.    The indictment alleges Fields slowly reversed his car to the top of the hill and then rapidly accelerated, ran through a stop sign and across a raised pedestrian mall, and drove directly into the crowd, striking numerous individuals, killing Heather Heyer, and injuring many others.  His car stopped when it struck another and then he fled the scene, the indictment says.  The rally in Charlottesville was marked with violence and deadly clashes that culminated with the car attack that left Heyer dead. As public figures and lawmakers condemned the bigotry and the hatred on the part of the neo-Nazis and white supremacists that arrived in Charlottesville for the rally, President Trump said his administration condemns such displays on many sides. City officials said 35 people were injured in events related to the rally. Two Virginia State troopers were also killed in a helicopter crash as they helped monitor events at the deadly rally.  Jason Kessler, the organizer of the Unite The Right rally, was recently given a permit by the National Park Service for a white civil rights in Washington D.C. The rally would take place Aug. 11-12, on the anniversary of the Charlottesville rally.  Photo by David McNew/Getty Images News/Getty Images  ",1,0,0
4,"BERKELEY, CA — A homeless Hispanic man was charged Thursday with assault with a deadly weapon and a hate crime enhancement for alleging attacking an Asian-American man with a rock in downtown Berkeley on Tuesday morning, prosecutors and police said.  Jeffrey Pachingger, 38, voluntarily came to the Berkeley Police Department after the alleged attack at the bike racks at Shattuck Avenue and Center Street at about 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday and admitted to hitting the victim with a rock because of an illegal Asian takeover, Officer Jason Muniz wrote in a probable cause statement.  When he was interviewed after being notified of his rights, Pachingger admitted to willfully trying to kill the victim because of his ethnicity and his belief of an Asian takeover, Muniz said.  Police spokesman Officer Byron White said the victim returned to the bike racks at Shattuck Avenue and Center Street and bent over to unlock his bike when a suspect, later identified as Pachingger, struck him from  behind in the back of his head with a large rock.  Muniz said the victim felt dizzy and thought he was going to lose consciousness and ran north on Shattuck Avenue because he thought Pachingger would hit him again.  The victim was transported to a hospital to be treated for a head injury, White said.  The violent attack was at least the second by a homeless person in downtown Berkeley in less than a week, as on June 13 a homeless man punched a police officer and gave her a concussion when she tried to help him at the corner of Allston Way and Shattuck Avenue.  Muniz said he arrested Pachingger on suspicion of attempted murder and commission of a hate crime because hitting the victim in the back of his head with a rock could have caused death or serious bodily injury and because he admitted that he hit the victim with a rock because he was trying to kill him.  Pachingger also admitted that his malice toward the victim was due to the victims ethnicity, Muniz wrote.  However, the Alameda County District Attorneys Office decided to charge Pachingger with assault with a deadly weapon instead of attempted murder.  In addition, it charged him with battery with serious bodily injury.  Pachingger, whos being held at the Berkeley Jail in lieu of $130,000 bail, was arraigned today and is scheduled to return to court on Friday to possibly enter a plea.  — Bay City News; Image via Shutterstock  ",1,0,0
5,"HENNEPIN COUNTY, MN — The FBI Thursday announced a five-count federal indictment charging Michael Hari, 47, Michael McWhorter, 29, and Joe Morris, 22, with charges including federal civil rights and hate crime violations in connection with an explosion at the Dar al-Farooq Islamic Center (DAF) in Bloomington Aug. 5.  McWhorter, Morris, and Hari were previously named in a criminal complaint filed on March 13 charging them with arson.  The three defendants are currently being held in custody in Urbana, Illinois, on separate charges.  All people – regardless of where they worship – have the right under federal law to live free from the threat of violence and discrimination, said Acting Assistant Attorney General John Gore in a statement. This Justice Department will hold accountable under the law anyone who attempts to commit violent acts of hate by threat or action.  These three defendants allegedly plotted and executed a plan designed specifically to spread fear and threaten a fundamental right afforded to all, the freedom of religion, said U.S. Attorney Erica H. MacDonald.  In spite of the destructive and violent act alleged in the indictment, our communities have found strength in taking a unified stand against the attack. My office and our law enforcement partners are committed to upholding the laws that protect the civil rights of all Americans.  The indictment returned by a federal grand jury alleges that Hari constructed a pipe bomb and rented a pickup truck in Champaign-Urbana, Illinois.  Hari, McWhorter, and Morris drove from Illinois to Bloomington in the pickup truck, stopping along the way to purchase diesel fuel and gasoline, authorities say.  The three men mixed these ingredients together in a plastic container, according to police.  The indictment alleges that in the early morning of Aug. 5, Morris broke a window at DAF and threw the plastic container filled with the diesel fuel and gasoline mixture into the building.  Its also alleged that McWhorter then lit the fuse and threw the pipe bomb in the broken window at DAF.  According to court documents, the window that was broken was part of the Imams office. When the pipe bomb exploded, it ignited the mixture in the plastic container, causing extensive damage in the Imams office.  McWhorter and Morris returned to the pickup truck, where Hari was waiting, and sped off, driving back to Illinois, police said.  The charges allege the men targeted the mosque with the intent to obstruct Muslims from worshipping there.  DAF serves as a religious center as well as a religious school for children.  As described in the complaint previously filed with the court, McWhorter said in reference to the DAF explosion, that the defendants did not intend to kill anyone, but they wanted to scare [Muslims] out of the country and to show them hey, youre not welcome here…  Authorities say a tip from a confidential source lead investigators to the defendants.

6,"SEATTLE, WA - On Friday evening outside the Beacon Hill light rail station, a man was captured on video using racial slurs aimed at blacks. He was later arrested by Seattle police on a malicious harassment charge, which is the states hate crime law.

According to those stats, the number of reported bias crimes increased by about 300 percent between 2012 and 2017. Over the first two quarters of 2018 alone, there have been more bias crimes reported (146) than in all of 2012 (106), 2013 (109), and 2014 (126).  In 2018 so far, blacks have reported the most bias crimes - 39 in total. Members of the LGBTQ community reported the second most with 34. You can view the citys complete bias crime dashboard here.

7,"New York has granted more than $2.1 million to Long Island nonprofit schools, day cares and cultural museums as part of the states Securing Communities Against Hate Crimes Grant Program, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced on Wednesday.  The money will be used to prevent hate crimes and attacks against the facilities, many of which are Jewish organizations. The state is providing $2.161,410 for 45 projects across Long Island.  This funding is critical in our efforts to enhance security and protect nonprofit schools, day cares and cultural museums at risk of hate crimes, Cuomo said. By supporting the diverse cultures and community centers found throughout this great state, we are setting an example for the nation while establishing a stronger, safer New York for all.  The grant, administered by the state Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services, provides up to $50,000 for security training, cameras and state-of-the-art technology, door-hardening, improved lighting and other security upgrades at each facility. Organizations that operate more than one facility were eligible to submit up to three applications for a total request of up to $150,000.    The organizations receiving grants are:  Central Synagogue-Beth Emeth  Chabad of Port Washington  Congregation Sons of Israel, Woodmere  Friedberg Jewish Community Center  Friends of the Brandeis School  Hebrew Academy for Special Children  Hebrew Academy of Long Beach  Hebrew Academy of Nassau County  Hebrew Academy of the Five Towns and Rockaways  Hewlett East Rockaway Jewish Centre  Long Island Hebrew Academy  Mesivta Ateres Yaakov of Greater Long Island  Mid-Island Y Jewish Community Center, Inc.

Huntington Hebrew Congregation  Roman Catholic Church of St. Mary  Suffolk Y Jewish Community Center  Our yeshivas, synagogues and community centers are vital institutions and especially in todays day and age, it is critical for us to do all we can to keep them safe, said Sen. Todd Kaminsky, who represents many of the organizations who are receiving grant money.  The state grant program was created last year after a nationwide scare in which Juan Thompson, a former journalist, was arrested and charged with making threats to Jewish organizations across the country, including many in New York.  As part of the response, the state also created a telephone hotline and text line to report incidents of bias and discrimination. State police receive referrals from both lines. A $5,000 reward was made available for any information leading to an arrest and conviction for a hate crime. Anyone who has experienced bias or discrimination are encouraged to call the toll-free hotline at (888) 392-3644 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday, or text HATE to 81336. If you want to report a crime or fear for your safety, call 911 immediately.  I am so pleased these grants are being awarded to help cultural places, private schools and day cares to protect them against vicious hate crimes, said Assemblywoman Melissa Miller. Places of worship and education should be safe havens, they should not be subjected to such insensitivity and violence. These are spaces where we celebrate life and our futures, so securing these grants will help ensure continued peace and prosperity in our community.    Photos courtesy Gov. Cuomos Office",0,8,5

9,"UNION SQUARE, NY -- The Brooklyn man who wore a Make America Great Again hat as he shoved a Latino man onto the subway tracks at Union Square has been formally charged with multiple hate crimes, prosecutors said Wednesday.  Willie Ames, 47, was indicted on four hate crime charges - including assault and attempted assault - and an aggravated harassment charge in New York State Supreme Court, said Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance.  Ames allegedly attacked two fellow commuters, ages 24 and 26, on the platform of the 14th Street - Union Square subway station at around 8:15 p.m on April 20 after yelling racist slurs at both men aboard a northbound 4 train, according to the indictment.

A 35-year-old man of Middle Eastern heritage heard those and other things screamed at him after being cut off and then forced to stop by two men in another vehicle Monday afternoon in the area of Ashton Avenue near Sudley Manor Drive, according to Prince William County Police.  Then the younger of the two men got out of their truck and approached the man before grabbing and assaulting him. The victim then fled and drove onto Interstate 66 where he pulled into a rest area/welcome and contacted police, who he provided with the suspects license number.

14,"LOS ANGELES, CA — The number of hate crimes reported to police in Los Angeles rose 10.8 percent in 2017, the fourth consecutive increase and part of a state and national trend that has seen a spike in such reports over the past several years, according to a study released Friday.  The study, conducted by the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at Cal State San Bernardino, consisted of a national sample of over three dozen large American cities, including 10 in California.  Long Beach saw its hate-crime reports double in 2017, and San Diego saw a 17-percent increase.  Riverside and San Bernardino were the only California cities in the study that saw a decrease in hate crimes reported last year.  Overall, the study showed a 12-percent increase in hate-crime reports nationwide in 2017, which follows a 5-percent increase in 2016.  California, however, has seen its hate-crime reports increase at a higher rate than the national figures, including a 19-percent rise in 2017. The CSUSB study records a 64 percent increase from 2014 to 2017 for the 10 California cities studied.  In Los Angeles, 254 hate crimes were reported in 2017. African- Americana and Jews were the most frequently targeted, but the city also had a significant rise in anti-transgender attacks. It was the largest number of reported hate crimes the city has seen since 2008, when the city recorded 280 hate crimes.  The most common type of offenses were property damage/vandalism (82); simple assault (53); aggravated assault (46) and criminal threat (44).  Among the cities studied, Los Angeles was second only to New York (339) in total hate-crime reports in 2017.

15,"MIAMI BEACH, FL — The four men arrested in connection with last months brutal assault of an openly gay couple and the Good Samaritan who rose to their defense, will now face enhanced criminal penalties under Floridas hate crime law. The attack occurred in the final hours of the Miami Beach Gay Pride festival along iconic Ocean Drive. Miami Beach police charged the four with aggravated battery.  The state has now filed enhanced charges as well as additional charges for two defendants. For all four defendants on two of the counts of aggravated battery, we have filed aggravated battery, great bodily harm with prejudice which now raises those to first-degree felonies, a Miami-Dade prosecutor told a Miami judge during a court proceeding on Wednesday.  The four charged in the beating include 21-year-old Juan C. Lopez, 20-year-old Luis M. Alonso, 21-year-old Adonis Diaz and 21-year-old Pablo Reinaldo Romo.  The decision to apply enhanced penalties was made by the Miami-Dade State Attorneys Office. All four men surrendered to Miami Beach police after surveillance images of them were shown by news organizations throughout the Miami area.  We are working closely with the Miami-Dade SAO to ensure the successful prosecution of this horrible crime, Ernesto Rodriguez of the Miami Beach Police Department told Patch Thursday.    Under Florida law, the penalty for any felony or misdemeanor can be reclassified to a higher level if the commission of such felony or misdemeanor evidences prejudice based on the race, color, ancestry, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, national origin, homeless status, or advanced age of the victim. The law states that A second-degree felony would become a first-degree felony under the charging guidelines. In this case all four defendants were initially charged with three counts of aggravated battery, which was listed as a second-degree felony.  All charging decisions are always based on the evidence provided by the police and by witnesses after they both have been interviewed by prosecutors, Ed Griffith of the State Attorneys Office told Patch when the initial charges were announced. Those interviews would be a part of the post-arrest process.  The attack came on Sunday, April 8 in what was the final day of the 10th anniversary celebration of the week-long festival. The event drew thousands to Miami Beach for a parade, fireworks display and concert by artist Taylor Dayne.  The incident took place Sunday evening, after the Miami Beach Pride Parade where two male members of the LGBT community were attacked as well as a third Good Samaritan who tried to help, Rodriguez said earlier.  The incident occurred at 7:40 p.m. outside the public restrooms along 6 Street and Ocean Drive. All three victims are residents of Miami Beach, according to a police report of the incident. One of the victims told police that he could hear the men repeatedly call him and his partner a gay slur in Spanish.  The two LGBT victims said they were standing on the north side of the restrooms when they were apparently selected at random by their attackers.  The Anti-Defamation League of Florida has said that the organization was horrified by this brutal attack and said that the Miami Beach Gay Pride festival should have been a time for celebration.  It should never have to be a time for fear, according to organization officials.    Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber and Police Chief Daniel Oates met with members of the citys LGBTQ advisory committee and briefed members on the hateful attack.

22,"BOSTON, MA – Someone spray painted the words White Lives Matter on a black-run Roxbury business that aims to help black entrepreneurs — just days before its Spring Grand Opening — prompting the owners to take to social media in protest.  Kai and Christopher Grant, the owners of Black Market in Dudley Square said they knew this was coming when they spotted the words across the back of their building Wednesday.    Its unfortunately no surprise to us. We live in a city with history so deeply rooted in racism and division, its not a shock to us that this ... occurred. Especially as our community gets more and more gentrified. It is proof that it is getting more difficult to stay culturally-rooted and grounded in our own Roxbury neighborhood, they posted to their Facebook page.  The retail pop-up in Dudley Square was established by the local entrepreneurs with the aim to revitalize Bostons Black Creative Economy and as such Black Market hosts a variety of African American vendors. The idea is that by highlighting local they will help local black businesses grow and eventually open up in nearby vacant store spaces. The couple has been battling graffiti outside on the fencing beside their business for two months and has been working with the City of Boston Roxbury Neighborhood Constituent Service Representative, Josh McFaddin on figuring out solutions they posted to social media.  Earlier this week, Chris was taking a series of pictures of the graffiti when he discovered that in the background of some of the photos, the businesss wall was littered with hate speech, including the white lives matters, phrase.  The owners, both longtime Roxbury residents, took to Facebook in a long post and in that open letter announced they refuse to let this stop them from trying to help their community.  We believe this person is simply suffering from what we deem as White privilege syndrome. We perceive that they may be enraged by the positive impact and effect that Black Market is having in our community without dependency or a handout from him/her. Perhaps he sees himself not benefiting directly from the outcomes of our Business, reads the post.  Boston Police are working to determine if the incident is a hate crime, and the mayor said this type of thing wont be tolerated.    Any defacement of other peoples property is a crime, and will not be tolerated. I know we have it in us to do better, as I saw this weekend during One Boston Day -- and as Bostonians we need to continue striving towards acting with kindness and goodwill every day of the year, said Mayor Marty Walsh in an emailed statement to Patch.  City Councilor Kim Janey, who represents parts of Roxbury, Dorchester, South End and Fenway and heads the Small Business and Consumer Affairs Committee said she was outraged.  I am outraged, saddened, and yet not surprised by this racist graffiti. It is particularly despicable that this vandalism has targeted a business with the stated mission of promoting economic justice. This incident is yet another example of how far we still have to go as a city, she said in a statement. Janey is also Grants sister.

Coincidentally, the girls father was driving by in his taxi as this occurred.  The father stopped his cab and confronted Beckham, he told police. He said Beckham then pulled a knife and began yelling racial slurs and swinging the pocket knife. After a scuffle during which both Beckham and the father were injured, the girls and their dad got into the cab, called police and followed Beckham until officers arrived.  The arresting officer wrote in his report that while in the patrol car, Beckham continued to yell racial slurs and threatened to kill the girls and their father when he was released from jail.    According to the federal indictment, in March 2018, Beckham falsely claimed to FBI special agents that he saw the girls trying to break into cars; that he never swung a knife at their father; and that, after he pulled out his knife, the girls yelled Allahu Akbar!, and then either one or both of them hit him on the back of the head.  If convicted on the hate crime charge, Beckham faces a maximum sentence of ten years in prison, three years of supervised release, and a fine of up to $250,000.

28,"OLATHE, Kan. (AP) — A man charged with fatally shooting an Indian immigrant last year at a suburban Kansas City bar pleaded guilty Tuesday to murder in the slaying that fanned fears of anti-immigrant violence following President Donald Trumps election.  Witnesses said Adam Purinton, who is white, yelled Get out of my country! before firing at two men who had stopped for an after-work drink at Austins Bar and Grill in Olathe, Kansas.  Srinivas Kuchibhotla was killed in the Feb. 22, 2017, attack. His friend Alok Madasani was wounded. The men, both 32, had come from India to the U.S. as students and worked as engineers at nearby GPS-maker Garmin.  Another man, Ian Grillot, was wounded when he tried to intervene.  Purinton faces life in prison with no chance of parole for 50 years when he is sentenced May 4 for premeditated first-degree murder.  At the time of the shooting, officials in India expressed concern about their citizens safety in the United States.  Kuchibhotlas widow, who was not at the hearing, issued a statement saying she hoped the guilty plea would send a strong message that hate is never acceptable.  We must understand and love one another, Sunayana Dumala said.  Purinton was asked to leave the bar when he made derogatory comments. He returned a short time later with a gun, according to court documents.  Madasani told detectives that the gunman asked the men if their status was legal before he opened fire, an affidavit indicated.  After the shooting, Purinton drove 70 miles (110 kilometers) east to Clinton, Missouri, and stopped at a restaurant, where he confessed to the killings to a bartender, who called police.  Purinton, a 52-year-old Navy veteran, was a regular customer at Austins. Neighbors in the Olathe cul-de-sac where he lived told The Associated Press after the shooting that he became a drunken mess following his fathers death about two years before the shooting and had physically and mentally deteriorated.  He still faces federal hate crime charges. Federal prosecutors have not determined whether to seek the death penalty.

The number of anti-Semitic incidents jumped by 60 percent nationally last year compared to 2016, the largest single-year increase on record and second-highest overall number since the ADL began tracking such incidents in the 1970s, according to the report.

In California, there were 268 anti-Semitic incidents reported last year, up from 211 in 2016 -- a 27 percent jump, according to the report.  While Californias increase was not as dramatic, it still reflects the growing climate of incivility, the emboldening of hate groups and widening divisions in society, ADL Pacific Southwest Regional Director Amanda Susskind said. We are particularly focused on the impact on schools and colleges where white supremacist and racist ideology is on the rise.  According to the report, there were 1,015 incidents of anti-Semitic harassment nationally in 2017, including 163 bomb threats against Jewish institutions, up 41 percent from 2016. There were also 952 incidents of vandalism, up 86 percent from the previous year, and 19 physical assaults, a 47 percent drop from 2016.  According to the ADL, some local incidents reported in the past year included taunts of Go back to concentration camp and Go back to oven at a Los Angeles private school; a man taunting Orthodox Jews in North Hollywood by shouting (expletive) the Jews and Heil Hitler; leaflets reading No Jews No Problems in Riverside; and white-supremacist symbols spray-painted on the garage of the ADL building in West Los Angeles.

The number of anti-Semitic incidents jumped by 60 percent nationally last year compared to 2016, the largest single-year increase on record and second-highest overall number since the ADL began tracking such incidents in the 1970s, according to the report.  The report noted there was a near-doubling of incidents nationally at schools and on college campuses, the second year in a row campuses saw a sharp increase.  A confluence of events in 2017 led to a surge in attacks on our community -- from bomb threats, cemetery desecrations, white supremacists marching in Charlottesville and children harassing children at school, said Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO and national director of the ADL.  In California, there were 268 anti-Semitic incidents reported last year, up from 211 in 2016 -- a 27 percent jump, according to the report.  While Californias increase was not as dramatic, it still reflects the growing climate of incivility, the emboldening of hate groups and widening divisions in society, ADL Pacific Southwest Regional Director Amanda Susskind said. We are particularly focused on the impact on schools and colleges where white supremacist and racist ideology is on the rise.  According to the report, there were 1,015 incidents of anti-Semitic harassment nationally in 2017, including 163 bomb threats against Jewish institutions, up 41 percent from 2016. There were also 952 incidents of vandalism, up 86 percent from the previous year, and 19 physical assaults, a 47 percent drop from 2016.  According to the ADL, some local incidents reported in the past year included taunts of Go back to concentration camp and Go back to oven at a Los Angeles private school; a man taunting Orthodox Jews in North Hollywood by shouting (expletive) the Jews and Heil Hitler; leaflets reading No Jews No Problems in Riverside; and white-supremacist symbols spray-painted on the garage of the ADL building in West Los Angeles.  We make government leaders and the public aware of anti-Semitism so we can counter it together, Greenblatt said. Anti-Semitism may be the oldest hatred, but it is deeply felt today and we will never give up on our important work to ensure our communities are safe for each and every one.

The 40-year-old man - driving a Camaro with a vanity plate the read Dirtbag - got into a minor rear-end crash with another driver while waiting in line at the Factoria Brown Bear car wash. When the other driver got out to inspect the damage, the man got out of the Dirtbag armed with a gun.  Police arrived around 3 p.m. and found the man in the Dirtbag Camaro and refusing to get out. When police removed him from the car, he allegedly punched one officer in the face and disparaged the ethnicity of the man he rear-ended.  Police shot the man with a Taser and were able to take him into custody. He was facing multiple charges including first-degree assault with a gun, assaulting a police officer, malicious harassment, obstructing police, and resisting arrest. Malicious harassment is Washingtons hate crime law.    Police also impounded the Dirtbag - the car, that is.  Image courtesy Bellevue police",1,0,0

DaShawn Horne, 26, a postal worker, is being treated at Harborview for a traumatic brain injury.

According to court records, Horne went to a home in Auburn on Jan. 19 with a woman he met at a Seattle nightclub. The next morning around 10 a.m., the woman called a Lyft for Horne. As he left her house, Tuimauga, the womans brother, allegedly confronted Horne. The Lyft driver, who was parked in front of the home, told police he saw Tuimauga confront Horne and then hit him with an aluminum bat.

37,"INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Indiana will remain one of just five states without a hate crimes law after Republican Senate leaders announced Tuesday they were killing a bill that targeted crimes motivated by bias.  Advocates say the move deals a blow to Indianapolis bid to land a new Amazon headquarters after unexpectedly making the shortlist of 20 finalists. The Republican Statehouse majorities, however, could not overcome opposition within their ranks.  Its a matter of peoples opinions. We just couldnt come to consensus, Republican Senate leader David Long, of Fort Wayne, said at a press conference announcing the effort was dead for the year. Later he added: Im the leader, but Im not the dictator.  A recent poll conducted by Ball State University found that 65 percent of Indiana residents support the creation of a hate crimes law.  But a deep thread of social conservatism runs throughout the Statehouse, and lawmakers faced pressure from activists who argue that a hate crimes law would create a special protected class of victims.  A provision that would have protected transgender people was a particular sticking point.  The bill by Republican Sen. Susan Glick would have specifically stated in law that a judge could take into account whether a crime was motivated by race, religion, color, sex, gender identity, disability, national origin, ancestry, sexual orientation or ethnicity.  RELATED: Indiana Hate Groups: Map Shows Active Racist Organizations  It also would have required such crimes to be reported to the FBI. Currently, Indiana law enforcement agencies are not required to do so.  When it comes to hate, when it comes to bias, I think its very important that we protect all of our citizens, said Glick, a former LaGrange County prosecutor. I think its important that Hoosiers send that message.  Anecdotal accounts suggest instances of bias crimes are on the rise in Indiana, and the Southern Poverty Law Center reports 26 active hate groups in the state.  Aside from Indiana, Georgia, Arkansas, Wyoming and South Carolina also lack hate crimes laws. In Georgia, where Atlanta is also on the Amazon shortlist, legislation to create a hate crimes law is still alive in the Legislature.  In Indiana, hate crimes bills have repeatedly failed to advance, but advocates initially expressed optimism that this year would be different. Thats because for the first time Long, Republican House Speaker Brian Bosma and GOP Gov. Eric Holcomb signaled a willingness to support such legislation.  The change of opinion came in the wake of clashes between white supremacists and counter demonstrators in Charlottesville, Virginia, that left one woman dead in August.  I said at the very outset that I was open to the idea of a hate crimes bill. I still am, Holcomb said in a statement on Tuesday. But, for any progress to be made, theres going to have to be consensus among lawmakers.  Democrats were quick to blame Republicans, while specifically singling out Holcomb, who they accused of tepid leadership.  Statehouse Republicans are more than willing to jeopardize Indianapolis shot at landing Amazons second headquarters, Indiana Democratic Party Chairman John Zody said in a statement. Call this what it is: a shameful disappearing act and failure of leadership from the governor.  Democratic Sen. Greg Taylor, of Indianapolis, similarly ripped the GOP.  What we did today was say to companies like Amazon ... We dont need your business, we dont need your economic development, we dont need your jobs, said Taylor, who is African American. We are comfortable with the status quo.  Republicans, meanwhile, pointed to a provision in existing state law that allows a judge to consider any special circumstance during sentencing. That, combined with existing court precedent, means a judge could indeed consider crimes motivated by hatred during sentencing, they argue.  But supporters say Indiana has a lingering reputation for intolerance. In 2015, then-Gov. Mike Pence signed a religious protections law creating a legal defense for businesses that objected to serving gay people. That provoked a national backlash and led to boycott threats, which prompted lawmakers to make changes to the law.  Long was dismissive of concerns that the bills failure could imperil Indianapolis Amazon bid.  I really dont think it should affect anything, said Long. Nor do I think we should tailor all of our legislation in hopes that a company would locate here.  ___  More: AP News; Associated Press writer Ben Nadler, in Atlanta, contributed to this report.

38,"CROFTON, MD — Placing a symbol of racial strife and violence at a local school is not a hate crime, a judge has ruled in the case of a Pasadena man who admits he climbed up on the roof of Crofton Middle School to hang a noose. John Havermann, 19, of Pasadena, was convicted of trespassing, disturbing school operations and conspiracy to disturb school operations. He is scheduled to be sentenced Monday.  His attorney successfully argued that the wording of Marylands hate crime law requires one specific person to be targeted, not a group. Without a specific victim named in the case, Havermann was not guilty, his lawyer says, while prosecutors call that argument absurd.  Anne Arundel County Judge Paul Harris Jr. said prosecutors didnt prove Havermann acted out of hatred since they didnt name a specific victim harmed by the act, the Capital-Gazette reports. The State did not produce any evidence that the Defendant harbored any animus or ill will towards the African-American principal, the African-American teacher whose classroom was directly exposed to the noose, or any individual person, Harris wrote.  A teacher spotted the noose hanging from a light fixture on the exterior of the school, located at 2301 Davidsonville Road in Crofton, on May 11. A school custodian immediately took the object down and police were called. After watching video surveillance from the school, police determined that two suspects gained access to the buildings roof and placed the noose on the light fixture.  Police spokesman Lt. Ryan Frashure previously told Patch that no note was left with the noose and police are still trying to determine the exact motive of the suspects. But police obviously know the powerful visual meaning that is associated with a noose, Frashure said.  On May 12, Anne Arundel County Police arrested Conner Charles Prout, 19, for hanging the racially-charged object a day earlier. He pleaded guilty to a charge of race/religious belief — harass/commit a crime upon in October and was sentenced to 120 hours of community service to be completed under the direction of the Anne Arundel County NAACP.  In arguing that the laws use of the word person should be applied to multiple victims, States Attorney Wes Adams says that limiting the word person used on the victim side of this statute would lead to an equally absurd conclusion when applied to the burning of a cross on a black familys home, reports the Capital-Gazette. Which family member would the Defendant propose was targeted?    Police posted still shots from the Crofton Middle Schools security footage to social media and received multiple tips that named Prout as the person shown. When police went to his house, Prout admitted he was the man on the security footage.  Principal Nuria Miller told parents in a May 11 letter that the action sent a disturbing and intolerant message to the community. She added that the incident is clearly disturbing on many levels. While it appears to have no connection to our instructional day or any instructional unit our students are currently studying, we cannot ignore the intolerant message this act conveys. She also vowed that it would not change the inclusive and supportive school community.  Prout was sentenced to a suspended sentence of three years in prison and 18 months of supervised probation. In addition to the standard conditions of probation, Prout must complete 120 hours of community service under the direction of the NAACP. The sentence was devised in collaboration with the Rev. Stephen A. Tillett, president of the Anne Arundel County NAACP.  We cannot tolerate any attempts to generate division within our community, especially when these acts affect our children, Adams said when Prout entered his plea. Although the hurt felt by those who witnessed the noose cannot be undone, I appreciate that Mr. Prout is accepting responsibility for his actions. The ability to come together and fashion a positive resolution to such a deplorable incident speaks volumes to our communitys commitment to moving forward toward equality.  »Photo courtesy of Shutterstock",1,0,3
39,"BEDFORD-STUYVESANT, BROOKLYN — A man who attacked a transgender woman inside a Bed-Stuy homeless shelter on Christmas Day faces hate crime charges, prosecutors announced Wednesday.  Kane Sekou, 40, used a chair to beat his 31-year-old victim in the 13th Regiment Armory shelter at 357 Marcus Garvey Boulevard on Dec. 25 around 6:15 p.m., according to the Brooklyn District Attorneys office.  The woman was walking down a hallway when she heard Sekou running toward her from behind, prosecutors said.  She turned to see Sekou swinging a chair, which he used to hit her across her back while screaming homophobic slurs, prosecutors said.  Police, who arrived at the shelter after the woman called 911, heard Sekou making homophobic comments and turned the case over to the Hate Crimes Task Force to investigate, prosecutors said.  Sekou was arraigned on charges of assault as a hate crime Wednesday in Brooklyn Criminal Court, prosecutors said.  This is not the first time Sekou has faced hate crime charges in New York City, the Daily News reported.  Sekou pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct in March after he attacked a gay man with a rock in The Bronx and called him a f----t, according to the Daily News. He served seven days community service for the crime.  The Bed-Stuy man was held on $20,000 bail Wednesday and told to return to court on March 14, according to prosecutors. He faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted of the top count.  This cowardly and unprovoked attack in which an innocent woman was assaulted simply because she is transgendered is despicable, said Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez.    In Brooklyn, we will not tolerate bias-motivated crimes of any kind.  Photo courtesy of Shutterstock",1,2,0

Coroners office announced Monday that Joseph Giaquinto, 36, committed suicide, the Fort Collins Coloradan reported.

41,"BOLINGBROOK, IL - Rachel Tuszynski, the 29-year-old Bolingbrook woman who spray-painted Bolingbrook Mayor Roger Claars house in September with numerous swastikas, profanity-laced messages and she also stole his American flag and Bolingbrook flag, has taken responsibility for her crimes. After spending more than three months of her life inside the Will County Jail, Tuszynski decided to plead guilty to a slew of felonies including a hate crime, threatening a public official and also criminal damage to property. Several other criminal charges were dismissed under her plea deal.  The court followed the recommendations of the attorneys and sentenced Tuszynski on the spot. In a nutshell, she got credit for time served, which amounted to 93 days in the Will County Adult Detention Facility. She was put on probation for the next 30 months. She was ordered to pay a hefty restitution fine of $3,295. She must perform 100 hours of court-ordered public service as part of her punishment.  Of particular note, the online court records note, Tuszynski needs to remain under the treatment and care of psychiatric professional and comply. After her sentencing hearing ended, jailers at Will County released Tuszynski from custody just before supper time on December 21. She was free to return to her house in the 200 block of Coral Court in Bolingbrook.  Claar, the mayor of Bolingbrook since the 1980s, was a huge supporter of the candidacy of Donald Trump in Trumps successful campaign for president in 2016. In September 2016, Patch covered the Donald Trump fund-raiser held at the Bolingbrook Golf Club where the minimum price for a ticket was $1,000.  RELATED: Donald Trumps Bolingbrook Fund-Raiser Brings Out Supporters, Enemies  RELATED: Mayor Claar Comes Out In Defense Of Donald Trump  In 2014, three Decembers ago, Tuszynski was profiled by The Associated Press for being a political activist. She even posed for a portrait with an Associated Press photographer at her apartment in Chicago. The AP article that was distributed internationally gave this account:  At 26, Rachel Tuszynski is hardly new to protest. She marched against the Iraq war in 2007 and, more recently, demonstrated in favor of legalizing medical marijuana. Then, last Thursday, Tuszynski and her girlfriend drove into downtown Chicago on an errand and, motivated by spontaneous curiosity, went looking for a march against police brutality that theyd heard about on the radio.  We drove down Michigan Avenue until we couldnt, said Tuszynski. I was in slippers ... and I heard helicopters and police and I just hopped out of the car, joining protesters shouting Hands Up. Dont Shoot. When someone handed her a sign with the message, Ferguson is Everywhere, she grabbed it.  Its like I have an internal fire and I am deeply, deeply upset by injustice. To me, this is injustice, she told the AP.  But now that shes a convicted felon, her days of political protesting may be numbered.  As far as her felony hate crime conviction, the criminal complaint stated that Tuszynski by reason of perceived creed of Roger Claar ... knowingly damaged a flagpole, garage door, driveway, brick walkway and garage service door of another, Roger Claar, without the consent of Roger Claar.    At last weeks sentencing, Tuszynski also learned she must never have any contact with the long-time mayor of Bolingbrook. If she does, her probation is likely to be revoked, and she could be carted off to prison.  Actually, Tuszynski must have no contact with Roger Claar, Pat Claar, their immediate family or their residence, court records reflect.

Samuel Blake Wickwire, an 18-year-old resident of Seal Beach, is the second charged with the hate crime, after being arrested on Dec. 10 in seal Beach. Wickwire joins Wade James Rutledge, a 27-year-old Seal Beach resident, who was originally charged with the crime on Dec. 5.  Four men were allegedly involved in the original incident when a same-sex couple was terrorized in a parking at the 10th Street Municipal Beach Parking Lot on the 900 block of Ocean Avenue on Nov. 3. The couple was walking through the Seal Beach lot when they were approached by four men.  The suspects made several derogatory comments about the victims same sex relationship and threatened to harm the victims, Seal Beach Police Department Sgt. Mike Henderson told Patch. A suspect then forcefully stole a cellular phone from one of the victims.  The Orange County District Attorneys Office said that Wickwire spat at the victims. Rutledge allegedly grabbed a cell phone from one of the victims as he was calling 911.  He disconnected a 911 call that was in progress, the OCDA Senior Deputy District Attorney Paul Chrisopoulos said. He then went back to his friends and told the victim not to call the police.  The victims were hounded by the mob of men as they attempted to get into their vehcile and leave the scene, according to Chrisopoulos.  Rutledge shoved one of the victims into the passenger seat and reportedly slammed the car door on his arm, while yelling at them to leave.  Rutledge faces seven years in state prison, while Wickwire faces six, if the maximum sentence for the crimes are imposed.

44,"A former Burlington County police chief who has been charged with hate crime assault, after he allegedly beat a black teen during an arrest last year later lied to federal agents investigating the incident, according to an indictment handed down on Thursday by the U.S. Attorneys Office out of New Jersey.    Frank M. Nucera Jr., 60, of Bordentown, has been indicted on one count of making false statements, one count of hate crime assault and one count of deprivation of civil rights under color of law. The count of making false statements was first introduced in a press release issued by Acting U.S. Attorney William Fitzpatricks office Thursday afternoon.    The charges relate to an incident from Sept. 1, 2016, in which Nucera was called in for backup by police officers responding to an incident at the Bordentown Ramada. Two teenagers had stayed at the hotel without paying, and were swimming in the hotel pool that afternoon, according to police. The teens were identified by Bordentown Township police as 18-year-old Timothy Stroye, of Trenton, and a 16-year-old female acquaintance.    When the first officers arrived to speak with them, both teens resisted arrest and the situation escalated into a physical altercation in which one cop used pepper spray, according to the indictment. As they were being arrested, Nucera arrived on the scene.    After Stroye was handcuffed and was being escorted from the hotel by police, Nucera came up from behind and slammed his head into a metal doorjamb, authorities allege.    Stroye had stopped for a moment to loudly complain, but wasnt kicking or struggling, according to the indictment. Authorities said the officer who was escorting the suspect at the time didnt file a complaint because he was afraid of Nocera retaliating.    When later questioned about the incident by Special Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Nucera claimed he hadnt touched the suspects during the arrest or detention.    Stroye was charged with two counts of aggravated assault on police, resisting arrest, improper behavior/disorderly conduct and theft of services. No information was provided concerning the teenage girl involved in the incident.  Nucera served as Bordentown Police Chief and Township Administrator before he abruptly retired earlier this year. Both the complaint filed earlier this year and the indictment handed down on Thursday chronicle past incidents in which Nucera enlisted the use of police dogs to intimidate African Americans, including at high school basketball games. In 2016, he allegedly told an officer to walk a K-9 through an apartment building in order to intimidate the African Americans who lived there.    His sudden resignation earlier this year came after the Attorney Generals Office was told by federal authorities that he was under investigation, according to the Courier Post.    He made $151,418.31 per year, and has an annual pension of $105,992.76, according to nj.com. He receives $8,832.73 per month.  Authorities previously said the use of excessive force and hate crime counts with which Nucera is charged each carry a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

45,"ST. LOUIS, MO — A Democratic Party Fundraiser, Matthew Lieberman, has been charged with multiple felonies after firing a handgun toward the Amoco gas station on Skinker Boulevard and shouting racist slurs from his Mercedes, according to court documents first reported by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Lieberman is white.  The attack occurred Tuesday around 11 p.m. In a separate incident the same night, Lieberman also slung bullets and racial epithets at overnight maintenance workers at a Jack in the Box on Hampton Avenue. Forensics evidence, including surveillance footage and bullet casings, tie Lieberman to both scenes. Police believe the same car was used to push through a group of demonstrators at a protest in September.  Lieberman was arrested Wednesday. No one was harmed in either shooting, but workers said they were shook up. Bond is set at $250,000.  Read more from the Post-Dispatch.  Image via Shutterstock",1,0,0
46,"HUNTLEY, IL - A number of charges have been brought forth against a 13-year-old Huntley resident as part of a police investigation into a threat and racial statements made via XBox Live. The teenager was charged in Juvenile Court with disorderly conduct (threats made to school), obstructing a peace officer, harassment by electronic communication, hate crime and disorderly conduct. The school-related charge is in reference to a threat made at Marlowe Middle School but the person charged in this incident is not the same person charged in connection with a reported hate crime at the school last month, police said.  The public is reminded that comments made via electronic means have consequences, police wrote in a release to media Tuesday. The Huntley Police Department takes matters such as this extremely serious and will take appropriate actions to maintain the safety and well-being of our community.

47,"WEST HARTFORD, CT —The lawyer for a former Connecticut college student accused of smearing body fluids on her roommates belongings said Tuesday that he doesnt expect authorities to file hate crime charges.  Attorney Tom Stevens comments came after former University of Hartford student Brianna Brochu appeared before a state judge in Hartford. The 18-year-old Harwinton resident is charged with misdemeanor criminal mischief and breach of peace.  Brochu, who is white, wrote on Instagram about rubbing used tampons on her black roommates backpack and putting her roommates toothbrush where the sun doesnt shine, according to West Hartford police. She also called her roommate Jamaican Barbie, and wrote that she put moldy clam dip in her roommates lotions and spit in her coconut oil.  The roommate, Chennel Rowe, said she developed severe throat pain.  NAACP members rallied outside the courthouse Tuesday and repeated their demand that prosecutors file felony hate crime charges.  Hartford States Attorney Gail Hardy said Tuesday that investigators are reviewing additional information at the request of Rowes lawyer. She would not elaborate. She said any decision on adding charges will be based on evidence and the law.  Brochu recently told the Republican-American newspaper that she acted foolishly but isnt racist.  Stevens said Brochu regrets her actions.  I think that when its all said and done, what youre going to see is that there was nothing racist that motivated this, he said outside the courthouse. These were two students who were placed together ... who didnt like each other ... and it escalated.  Brochu told police that she did put tampon blood on Rowes backpack and licked Rowes plate, fork and spoon, but denied doing anything else, authorities said. Brochu said she lied in the Instagram post in an attempt to appear funny, a police report said. She said her actions were in retaliation for Rowes rude behavior and Rowe posting videos of her sleeping and making fun of her snoring.  University of Hartford officials said Brochu is no longer a student at the school, but did not elaborate.

48,"The FBI has released Hate Crime Statistics, 2016, which is the latest compilation from the Uniform Crime Reporting Program regarding bias-motivated incidents across the U.S. According to the FBI, more than 15,000 law enforcement agencies submitted the 2016 data, which provides info. on the victims, offenders and locations of more than 6,000 criminal incidents and more than 7,000 related offenses. The FBI says these incident reports detail events as being motivated by bias toward race, ancestry, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientaiton, disability, gender and gender identity.  Highlights of Hate Crime Statistics, submitted in a release from the FBI:  Victims of Hate Crime Incidents  There were 6,063 single-bias incidents involving 7,509 victims. A percent distribution of victims by bias type showed that 58.9 percent of victims were targeted because of the offenders race/ethnicity/ancestry bias; 21.1 percent were targeted because of the offenders religious bias; 16.7 percent were victimized because of the offenders sexual-orientation bias; 1.7 percent were targeted because of the offenders gender identity bias; 1.0 percent were victimized because of the offenders disability bias; and 0.5 percent were victimized because of the offenders gender bias. (Due to rounding, percentage breakdowns may not add to 100.0 percent.)  Fifty-eight (58) multiple-bias hate crime incidents involved 106 victims.  Offenses by Crime Category  Of the 4,720 hate crime offenses classified as crimes against persons in 2016, 44.7 percent were for intimidation, 35.7 percent were for simple assault, and 18.5 percent were for aggravated assault. Nine murders and 24 rapes (all from agencies that collected data using the revised definition of rape) were reported as hate crimes. The remaining 18 hate crime offenses were reported in the category of other.  There were 2,519 hate crime offenses classified as crimes against property. The majority of these (75.9 percent) were acts of destruction/damage/vandalism. Robbery, burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft, arson, and other offenses accounted for the remaining 24.1 percent of crimes against property.  Eighty-two (82) additional offenses were classified as crimes against society. This crime category represents societys prohibition against engaging in certain types of activity such as gambling, prostitution, and drug violations. These are typically victim-less crimes in which property is not the object.  RELATED:  Known Offenders  In the UCR Program, the term known offender does not imply that the suspects identity is known; rather, the term indicates that some aspect of the suspect was identified, thus distinguishing the suspect from an unknown offender. Law enforcement agencies specify the number of offenders and, when possible, the race of the offender or offenders as a group. Beginning in 2013, law enforcement officers could also report whether suspects were juveniles or adults, as well as the suspects ethnicity when possible.  Of the 5,770 known offenders, 46.3 percent were White, and 26.1 percent were Black or African American. Other races accounted for the remaining known offenders: 0.8 percent were Asian; 0.8 percent were American Indian or Alaska Native; 0.1 percent were Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander; and 7.7 percent were of a group of multiple races. The race was unknown for 18.1 percent.  Of the 4,222 known offenders for whom ethnicity was reported, 26.1 percent were Not Hispanic or Latino, 8.0 percent were Hispanic or Latino, and 2.3 percent were in a group of multiple ethnicities. Ethnicity was unknown for 63.6 percent of these offenders.  Of the 4,100 known offenders for whom ages were known, 83.8 percent were 18 years of age or older.  Locations of Hate Crimes  Law enforcement agencies may specify the location of an offense within a hate crime incident as 1 of 46 location designations. In 2016, most hate crime incidents (27.3 percent) occurred in or near residences/homes. More than 18 percent (18.4) occurred on highways/roads/alleys/streets/sidewalks; 9.9 percent occurred at schools/colleges; 5.7 percent happened at parking/drop lots/garages; and 3.9 percent took place in churches/synagogues/temples/mosques. The location was reported as other/unknown for 12.7 percent of hate crime incidents. The remaining 22.1 percent of hate crime incidents took place at other or multiple locations.

Send local news tips, photos and press releases to eric.kiefer@patch.com. Dont forget to visit the Patch Bloomfield Facebook page here.  Bloomfield High Schools theater program will join a worldwide network of performances to honor the victims of hate crimes with its fall play, The Laramie Project: Ten Years Later, from Nov. 16 to 18 at 7 p.m. at the Westminster Arts Center at Bloomfield College.  In November 1998, University Of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard, a member of the LGBTQ community, was severely beaten and tied to a fence. Shepard died six days later and his murder garnered national attention as a hate crime. Shortly thereafter, playwright Moisés Kaufman and members of his Tectonic Theatre Project went to Laramie, Wyoming in search of answers about Shepards death. After 18 months, multiple visits and more than 200 interviews with local residents, Kaufman envisioned and wrote the play, The Laramie Project, based on the texts of the interviews. Ten years later, Kaufman returned to Laramie to explore the effects of Shepards murder and the spotlight it placed on the town. The Laramie Project: Ten Years Later reflects how time and experience affects societys views on significant events and asks the question, How does society write its own history?  Bloomfield High School has join the Gloucester County Technical Institute s initiative The Laramie Project Project (LPP) which aims to unite thespian groups around the world in performing the play to raise awareness about hate crimes. BHS thespians will dedicate their performance of The Laramie Project: Ten Years Later to the memory of Orlando Pulse victim, Oscar A. Aracena-Montero, and hopes to honor both Aracena-Montero and Shepard by highlighting the messages of compassion and activism that are conveyed in the play.

The Foxy is given to a passionate theatre teacher who inspires their students, creates community and a loving extended family within the program, while producing high quality productions.  Doemling believes that the timing, and the place, are right for this production. He commented that Bloomfield High School has been recognized as the most diverse high school in the state of New Jersey. We sometimes forget that our society, as a whole, still suffers from bigotry and hate and that the struggle for equality is far from over.

53,"QUEENS, NY – Vandals caused $100,000 to headstones at a Queens cemetery, spraying racists slurs on the monuments and pushing dozens of them over, prosecutors said.  Mark A. Barrancos, 21, of Forest Hills, Bruno Camacho, 21, of Elmhurst, and Edward Evseev, 21, of Richmond Hill are accused of breaking into the Cypress Hills Cemetery the night of Aug. 14, vandalizing more than 100 headstones, along with mausoleums and monuments, said Queens District Attorney Richard Brown.    The three men were arraigned Monday. They are accused of knocking over 72 headstones in the cemeterys and damaging another 72 with painted slogans including God LOL and the N word, Brown said.  They also allegedly spray painted the words Ching Chong on the Gee Poy Kup Associations monument and the Sze Kong Mutual Benevolent Associations arch, along with smearing the words F--- Jackie Chan on an Asian headstone with what appeared to be human feces, Brown said.  They are also accused of damaging the cemeterys Memorial Abbey Mausoleum, where 15 more vaults were either cracked or painted, three stained glass windows were broken and several statues either knocked over or broken, Brown said.    In Queens County, the most culturally diverse county in the nation, crimes of hate will never be tolerated and we will do all in our power to root out those responsible for such hate and prejudice, Brown said.  The men were each charged with burglary, criminal mischief, cemetery desecration, aggravated harassment and criminal trespass as hate crimes, Brown said. Bail was set at $100,000 and the men were ordered to return to court Nov. 15, he said. Each could face up to 15 years in prison.  Lead image via Patch.    ",1,0,2
54,"Federal authorities have charged a former Burlington County police chief with hate crime assault, after he allegedly beat a black teen during an arrest last year, then made racist comments that were captured on video recording following the incident.    Frank M. Nucera Jr., 60, of Bordentown, was arrested by FBI agents and charged with a hate crime assault and the deprivation of civil rights under color of law, Acting U.S. Attorney William E. Fitzpatrick and FBI Special Agent in Charge Timothy Gallagher announced Wednesday.    Nucera, who was the township administrator as well as its police chief before he retired earlier this year, was called in for backup on Sept. 1, 2016 to the Bordentown Ramada. Police officers had responded to a call involving two teenagers who were staying at a hotel without paying, according to documents filed in the case and statements made in court.  The first officers arrived and spoke with the teens, described as an 18-year-old black man and a 16-year-old black female. The situation escalated into a fight when both teens resisted arrest, according to authorities, which is when Nucera showed up at the scene.    After the man was handcuffed and was being escorted from the hotel by police, Nucera came up from behind and slammed his head into a metal doorjamb, authorities allege. The man had stopped for a moment to loudly complain, but wasnt kicking or struggling, according to the complaint. The officer who was escorting the suspect at the time didnt file a complaint because he was afraid of Nocera retaliating, according to the complaint.  Later, at the police departments headquarters, the suspect told police of headaches and a possible concussion, according to the complaint. However, when he was dismissed by an EMT, he stopped, and opted to be processed at the county jail.  Another officer later surreptitiously recorded Nucera making racist and hostile remarks about the teens and minorities in general. Nucera is alleged to have said he believed these people should stay out of Bordentown, and it would have been nice if officers could have used a police dog during the arrest.  The complaint against Nucera chronicled past incidents in which he enlisted the use of police dogs to intimidate African Americans, including at high school basketball games. In 2016, he allegedly told an officer to walk a K-9 through an apartment building in order to intimidate the African Americans who lived there.  Nuceras first court appearance was Wednesday afternoon, at which time he was told to turn over all firearms to the FBI. A judge ruled he could be released on $500,000 unsecured bond, according to the Burlington County Times.  His sudden resignation earlier this year came after the Attorney Generals Office was told by federal authorities that he was under investigation, according to the Courier Post.  He made $151,418.31 per year, and has an annual pension of $105,992.76, according to nj.com. He receives $8,832.73 per month.  His attorney wasnt immediately available to Patch for comment on Wednesday.    The nobility of police officers is rooted in their selfless commitment to protect our communities and their pledge to honor our constitutional values. As Chief of the Bordentown Township Police Department, the defendant dishonored the profession by doing neither, Fitzpatrick said. The complaint alleges that the defendant harbored an intense racial animosity towards African Americans, and on September 1, 2016, that senseless hatred led to the unlawful assault of a handcuffed and defenseless prisoner. The conduct alleged is a shocking breach of the duty of every police officer to provide equal justice under the law and never to mistreat a person in custody. As a result, the former chief of police is now a charged federal criminal defendant.    Police officers take an oath to uphold the law. The FBI works to ensure that they are held accountable when they violate that oath and break the law, Gallagher said. We rely on the police to protect the public. The few who take advantage of that public trust, at any level, will be investigated and prosecuted to the full extent of the law.  Burlington County Prosecutor Scott Coffina stated that Nuceras actions shouldnt reflect negatively on all law enforcement in the county.  We are sickened by the allegations and hateful comments that underlie these charges. There is no place for these sentiments or actions in our society, and they most definitely do not reflect the ideals of the law enforcement community across Burlington County, Coffina said. To that point, we are heartened that the FBIs thorough investigation concluded that this behavior was confined to the individual who has been charged. It is not a reflection of the culture of the Bordentown Township Police Department, its current leadership, or the dedicated officers on the force. In fact, as the Acting U.S. Attorney noted during his press conference, the information leading to these charges was brought forward by individuals within the Bordentown Police Department itself. The Burlington County law enforcement community is filled with honorable people who chose this profession for the right reasons. My office enjoys working with all of them to serve all residents of our county in a professional, respectful manner.  The township appreciates the comments of the U.S. Attorney and Burlington County Prosecutor, which reinforce what we already knew, that these charges are limited to one person and not indicative of the Bordentown Township Police Department or the township as a whole, Bordentown Township Mayor Steve Benowitz said. The specifics of these charges, all of which we are hearing for the first time are abhorrent, and the township fully supports the U.S. Attorney in this process.    Benowitz pointed out that the charges began with a self-reported incident from within the police department.    The township has moved forward with new leadership that promotes community, inclusion and equality, Benowitz said. All residents, businesses and visitors can be assured that all township services, including public safety, are operating at the high level that they have come to expect. While this specific situation casts a negative light on one former employee, the township fully intends on continuing our positive growth and development.  The use of excessive force and hate crime counts with which Nucera is charged each carry a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

55,"WEST HARTFORD, CT — A University of Hartford student has been expelled from the school for reprehensible conduct toward her roommate, who she referred to as Jamaican Barbie on social media, including smearing bodily fluids on the victims personal property. Brianna Brochu, 18, was arrested on a warrant last week on misdemeanor charges, but as more details from the case emerged, West Hartford Police announced Wednesday afternoon that they would be seeking an additional hate crime charge. The victim spoke out about the bullying case in a Facebook Live post on Monday night.  In a post on Instagram, Brochu was apparently celebrating that she had finally gotten rid of her roommate and claimed that for the past month she had spit in the victims coconut oil, put moldy clam dip in her lotion, rubbed used tampons on her backpack and put her toothbrush in places where the sun doesnt shine.  The victim told police that she had experienced severe throat pain and felt the pain was a result of Brochus tampering with her personal items, according to Lt. Michael Perruccio. Police began investigating the incident on Oct. 18 after being notified of the complaint by the University of Hartfords Public Safety department.  The Hartford Courant reports that Brochu told police that she licked the victims plate, fork and spoon and smeared her own bodily fluid on the victims backpack, but denied the other things she wrote about on social media and said it was an attempt to be funny.  After the victims story spread on social media, University of Hartford President Greg Woodward sent a message to the school community on Tuesday night saying that Brochus behavior was reprehensible and does not reflect the values of our institution.  The incident has brought about accusations of racism, and I want you to know that I hear and share your anger and frustration, Woodward said. Acts of racism, bias, bullying, or other abusive behaviors will not be tolerated on this campus. I pledge to do everything in my power to work with our community to address related concerns together.  Woodward then sent an update on the deeply disturbing situation on Wednesday afternoon and said that Brochu is no longer a student at the University of Hartford and she will not be returning to the institution.  There has been an outpouring of concern for the victim of these acts from across the University and the country, Woodward said in the update. In my meeting with her yesterday, I reiterated my personal commitment to ensuring she has all available personal and academic resources the University can provide.  As I said yesterday, the University took action immediately once these allegations were brought to our attention. University Public Safety was first notified and responded to this incident at 11:48 p.m. on October 17.

58,"BOLINGBROOK, IL — A 29-year-old woman from Bolingbrook finds herself in serious trouble with authorities after being arrested this week on charges of committing a hate crime against long-time Bolingbrook Mayor Roger Claar.  Rachel Tuszynski, of the 200 block of Coral Court, was arrested Thursday by Bolingbrook police. She faces six felonies and two misdemeanors, including two counts of threatening a public official, criminal damage to government supported property, two counts of criminal defacement to property, criminal damage to property, hate crime and theft.  The eight-page criminal complaint states that on or about Wednesday, Tuszynski knowingly and willfully delivered to Bolingbrook Mayor Roger Claar, a public official, a communication containing a threat that would place the public official or member of his immediate family in reasonable apprehension of immediate of future bodily harm ... spray-painted swastikas on his property with a written message to resign.  As far as the hate crime charge, the criminal complaint states that Tuszynski by reason of perceived creed of Roger Claar, regardless of the existence for any other motivating factors, knowingly committed criminal damage to property ... in that she knowingly damaged a flagpole, garage door, driveway, brick walkway and garage service door of another, Roger Claar, without the consent of Roger Claar.  One of the misdemeanor offenses accuses Tuszynski of stealing an American flag and a Bolingbrook flag from the Claar residence with the intent to deprive Roger Claar permanently of the use or benefit of the property.  The defendant is also accused of damaging the Sherwin Williams building in the 400 block of North Bolingbrook Road by defacing said property by the use of paint or any other similar substance and the damage to the property did not exceed $500.  Bolingbrook police Lt. Anthony Columbus said the vandalism was discovered around 7 a.m. Thursday. Besides Claars home, two other nearby locations were also vandalized with spray paint, he said. According to Bolingbrook police, detectives quickly developed a suspect and she was taken into custody.  Jail logs at the Will County Adult Detention Facility indicate that Tuszynski was booked on the eight criminal charges. Her bond was set at $150,000, meaning she must come up with 10 percent of that amount ($15,000) to get out of jail while her charges are pending.  After reviewing Tuszynskis financial assets, a judge in Will County appointed the public defenders office to represent her. As part of her bond conditions, the court has ordered Tuszynski to have no contact under any circumstances with Bolingbrook Mayor Roger Claar or members of his family. She must also stay away from two Bolingbrook properties on Concord Lane and Canterbury Lane. Court records indicate the defendant will be permitted to have contact with the Bolingbrook Village Hall for lawful purposes only.      Tuszynski remained in the Will County lockup as of Friday afternoon.

63,"SEATTLE, WA - Seattle police have seen uptick in reports of bias crimes over the first six months of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, according to a new department report. The increase matches a nationwide trend where reports of bias or hate crimes have increased, but Seattle police attributed the 2017 increase to victims feeling more comfortable reporting a bias crime.  The department reported that bias crimes involving hateful language increased the most at 64 percent. The crimes most often happen at night between strangers, Seattle police reported.  The first half of 2017 was characterized by a high level of interest in the community regarding hate crimes, as evidenced by the high rate of reporting in Seattle. I was contacted many times by people wanting to report incidents they had witnessed, or asking how they could help if they were to see someone being victimized, Bias Crimes Coordinator Det. Beth Wareing said in a department blog post about the increase. We rely on the community to stay involved and aware for our efforts in combating hate crimes to be successful. The community is our most valuable partner.    Gays, blacks, and Jewish people were the top three groups affected by bias crime in Seattle, according to the report. Washingtons malicious harassment law deals with crimes motivated by hatred toward a particular group.

In early May, a man pulled a pellet gun on two people in the Hillman City neighborhood and shouted anti-gay slurs at them.

66,"GOSHEN, NY — Orange County District Attorney David M. Hoovler announced Tuesday that Maria Medina, 67, formerly of Wallkill, pleaded guilty to the felony of Immigrant Assistance Services Fraud in the First Degree. At the time that she pleaded guilty, Medina admitted that she had defrauded at least four different recent immigrants from Mexico and Columbia, making false promises to them that she would be able to expedite changes to their legal immigration status by providing them with United States residency cards, commonly called green cards. As part of the plea agreement, Medina agreed to pay $9,350 in restitution to the immigrants she had defrauded.  Medina acknowledged that she will likely be deported after serving a term of incarceration that may be imposed on her when she is sentenced Oct. 24. (For more information on this and other neighborhood stories, subscribe to Patch to receive daily newsletters and breaking news alerts.)  Medinas guilty plea marks the first time that the Orange County District Attorneys Office has obtained a conviction for the felony of Immigrant Assistance Services Fraud in the First Degree. The case was brought as part of Orange County District Attorneys Office Immigrant Affairs Initiative.  Photo credit: Orange County District Attorneys Office  In Aug. 2016, Hoovler launched a new initiative, designed to assist Orange Countys immigrants in dealing with the criminal justice system. As part of the initiative, the District Attorneys Office joined the New York State District Attorneys League of Immigrant Affairs (DALIA), an organization that comprises six other New York State district attorneys offices, those in the New York City boroughs of Queens, Manhattan, Brooklyn, and the Bronx, as well as Nassau and Westchester counties.  Under the Orange County District Attorneys Offices Immigrant Affairs Initiative, an immigrant who has been the victim of a crime is able to call the District Attorneys Immigrant Affairs Coordinator to report the crime, and the Immigrant Affairs Coordinator, in turn, will ensure that the immigrants complaint is routed to the prosecution unit within the District Attorneys Office that is most appropriate to investigate it.  Victimized immigrants may report any type of crime, including violent crimes, human trafficking, domestic violence, and frauds. Immigrants who wish to report being the victim of a crime, or who otherwise need assistance in dealing with a criminal case in which they are the victim, or those wishing additional information about the initiative, may contact Counsel to the District Attorney Robert Conflitti, who serves as the Immigrant Affairs coordinator, by calling (845) 291-2050 or by email.  District Attorney Hoovler thanked the New York State Police for their investigation and for the arrest of Medina.  In addition, in June 2017, an Orange County grand jury charged Byron Castillo, 36, formerly of Middletown, with five counts of Grand Larceny in the Third Degree, as a Hate Crime; Scheme to Defraud in the First Degree; and five counts of Immigrant Assistance Services Fraud in the First Degree.  The case is also being prosecuted as part of the District Attorneys Immigrant Affairs Initiative.  It is alleged that Castillo defrauded five recent immigrants from Ecuador, by promising them that their relatives could get United States visas, and by providing them with false visa documents and plane tickets. The indictment alleges that Castillo stole in excess of $3,000 from at least five victims, and that he selected his victims in whole or in substantial part because of their national origin. It is alleged that Castillo targeted victims because they were from Ecuador.  The targeting of victims because of their race, color, national origin, ancestry, gender, religion, religious practice, age, disability or sexual orientation of a person, regardless of whether the belief or perception is correct, renders some offenses, such as grand larceny, to be designated as hate crimes, and allows for enhanced punishment. If convicted of Grand Larceny in the Third Degree, as a Hate Crime, Castillo faces up to five to 15 years in state prison.  The Orange County District Attorneys Office and the City of Middletown Police Department are seeking the publics help in locating Byron Castillo. Anyone with information concerning Castillos current location is urged to call Detective Evan Colon at the City of Middletown Police Department, or the Orange County District Attorneys Office at 845-291-2050.  The cases against Medina and Castillo are being prosecuted by Assistant District Attorney Kerry Kolek.  Those who think that they can escape arrest or prosecution in Orange County by preying on undocumented immigrants, who may be reluctant to come forward because of their immigration status, are sadly mistaken, Hoovler said. It is our duty as prosecutors to prosecute every crime, regardless of the citizenship status of the victim. All crime affects everyone in the community, and diminishes everyones quality of life. It must be well understood that this Office will not tolerate criminal acts of any type, against any victim, and if an offender selects a victim based on the victims race, color, national ancestry, religion, ethnicity, gender, sexual preference or identity, or any other constitutionally protected classification, we will prosecute those crimes to fullest extent of the law, and, as appropriate, we will seek enhanced sentences for those acts under New Yorks hate crime statutes. We are a nation of immigrants and all of our residents deserve to be free from being victimized by crime. I urge anyone who believes that they or someone they know has been a victim of Immigrant Assistance Services Fraud, or any immigrant who has been the victim of a crime, but is reluctant to report that crime for fear of immigration consequences, to contact our Immigrant Affairs Coordinator or any other appropriate law enforcement agency.

71,"INDIO, CA – A man who accidentally shot himself during an alleged attempt to kill a black employee at a Desert Hot Springs auto parts store must stand trial for attempted murder and hate crime charges, a judge ruled Wednesday.  Rudy Arana, 19, allegedly brought a sawed-off shotgun to an Autozone store on March 30, and following a tussle with the employee that brought both men to the ground, shot himself in the lower body, according to Desert Hot Springs police.  The employee testified Wednesday that as the work day started, he saw Arana trying to get into his car in the parking lot. He told Arana to leave, but he allegedly returned a short time later and asked other employees where the victim was, while calling himself an N-word killer, according to court documents.  After continuing to loiter near the store, Arana saw the employee he was seeking when the worker left the store to take out the trash, the victim testified.  As they wrestled for control of the gun, Arana allegedly cursed at the employee and referred to him using the N-word, saying, Im going to kill you, the victim testified. He said two shots were fired during the struggle, including the shot that struck Arana.  Arana was taken to a hospital for treatment of his injuries and was later placed under arrest. No one else was injured in the shooting.  Arana was later charged with attempted murder, along with multiple sentence-enhancing allegations, including hate crime, firearm and gang allegations.  He will return to court Aug. 2 for a post-preliminary hearing arraignment. He remains jailed on $1 million bail.  – By City News Service / Image via Shutterstock",1,0,0
72,"WASHINGTON, DC — An 18-year-old man has been charged as a suspect in connection to a hit-and-run and possible hate crime against a transgender woman in Northeast Washington, police said.  Startwaune Anderson, of Northeast DC, was arrested and charged with aggravated assault while armed for the July 5 incident. Police say the weapon was the car Anderson was driving.  At around 3:15 a.m. July 5, Anderson allegedly intentionally struck a transgender woman who was walking in the 400 block of K Street, police told Patch. Anderson then fled eastbound on K Street and the victim was transported to an area hospital, where she was listed in critical condition, police said.  According to WJLA, a friend of the victim said several men were hollering at the victim while she was walking down the street. They then got into an argument with a man in the group the victim was with.  The friend said one of the men made a threat, and soon after that the transgender woman was hit.  We can not definitively say at this point that it was a hate crime, but we have not ruled that out, and were still investigating it, Acting Captain Anthony Haythe with the Metropolitan Police Department said.    Anderson has a court appearance scheduled for Thursday. Subscribe to the Washington DC Patch to stay up to date with all your local crime news.  Shutterstock Photo",1,2,0
73,"CHICAGO, IL — The City of Chicago and the head of the Chicago Police Department have asked a judge to block a Glenview man from a list of potential police officers eligible to attend the academy.  In a petition filed Monday in Cook County Circuit Court, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson asked a judge to review a decision by Chicagos Human Resources Board to allow Patrick Lavin, a 27-year-old Glenview resident, to be hired as a probationary Chicago police officer, citing a 2011 arrest.  Lavin was charged with felony aggravated battery, battery and a hate crime after a fight outside a bar in Carbondale in 2011. He said the group of people he was with got into an argument over who a taxicab belonged to, which escalated into a shoving match and an eventual exchange of blows, according to the filing.  Court records show the felony charges were dropped and the incident was expunged from Lavins record after he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor battery. (Sign up for our free daily newsletters and breaking news alerts for the Glenview Patch.)  Lavin was initially charged with a hate crime because one of the people involved was gay, although he said he never knew the sexual orientation of anyone involved, according to a report by a hearing officer of the Human Resources board. He was sentenced to an anger management evaluation and a year of court supervision, the Chicago Tribune reported.  But Johnson and lawyers representing the city argue the facts disqualify Lavin from being eligible to serve as a probationary officer. CPD policy states that if there is evidence that the applicant has engaged in criminal conduct, even if the applicant was never convicted of any criminal offense, then the applicant should be disqualified from consideration, the filing said.  Lavin challenged his disqualification, and on March 6 an administrative hearing officer agreed with him that Chicagos lawyers had failed to prove that he had engaged in conduct constituting a felony. Mondays filing seeks to overturn that ruling.  Lavin could not be reached for comment Tuesday.

74,"NEW CITY, NY — From the Rockland County Legislature:  The Rockland County Legislature is calling upon the New York State Senate to reconsider and pass the Gender Expression Non-Discrimination Act, known as GENDA.  The legislation prohibits discrimination based on gender identity or expression and amends the state hate crimes statutes to include offenses regarding gender identity or expression.  Legislators voted 14-0 Tuesday to back the county resolution, which was sponsored by Legislator Alden H. Wolfe.  How appropriate that we should vote on this matter the same week that we celebrate the 241st anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, with its famous decree that all men are created equal and endowed with certain unalienable rights, Wolfe said. This bill seeks to make sure all people are truly treated equally by outlawing discrimination and by punishing those who engage in such behavior.  The state bill has been passed in the Assembly nine times, most recently in March of this year. Eighteen other states, the District of Columbia, and 157 cities and counties across the country have already passed transgender-inclusive civil rights legislation, and GENDA would extend these protections across New York State.  Brooke Malloy, executive director of the Rockland County Pride Center, was among those attending the Legislatures Tuesdaymeeting. The Pride Center is a Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender (LGBT) organization with an anti-racist, social justice mission.  Passing this resolution is a clear indication of the Rockland County Legislatures desire to embrace and support all residents, Malloy said. The Rockland County Pride Center is grateful for strong bipartisan government leaders who believe in equality and justice for all, with no exceptions.  Currently, neither federal nor state statutes ban discrimination in areas of employment, housing or public accommodations based on gender identity or expression, and courts have generally not interpreted sexual orientation nondiscrimination laws to include transgender discrimination.  Every day that goes by without this bill becoming law is another day that our neighbors who are part of the transgender community face discrimination – and perpetrators face no real consequences, Wolfe said. It is past time that we put laws in place to address this civil rights issue. I am proud to support this effort and call upon the state Senate to act immediately.",0,8,5
75,"FLATBUSH, BROOKLYN — A Flatbush man has been charged for allegedly shouting anti-gay slurs and punching a woman on the subway in May, prosecutors said.  Antoine Thomas, 27, got on a Brooklyn-bound Q train at Union Square on May 21 and sat down next to a woman and her girlfriend, according to the Brooklyn District Attorneys Office.    Thomas shouted anti-gay slurs during their train ride and at one point aggressively bumped into the victim when the train made a sudden stop, the D.A.s office said.  When the train got to the Dekalb Avenue stop in Downtown Brooklyn, Thomas punched the woman in the face, the D.A.s office said.  Thomas then tried to leave the train by walking between cars but was caught after the train conductor called police, according to the office.  Thomas was charged with second-degree assault as a hate crime, third-degree assault as a hate crime and other related offenses.  Brooklyn is a model of inclusion and diversity where bias and bigotry will not be tolerated, Acting Brooklyn District Attorney Gonzalez said. This defendants alleged actions were an attack on everyones right to be who they are, and to love whom they choose. He will now be held accountable for this alleged attack that left a woman unconscious.  ",1,4,3
76,"LAKEWOOD, NJ — An anti-Semitic banner and fliers posted around Lakewood this weekend that referenced the recent string of arrests in a public assistance fraud investigation are under investigation by state and local authorities.  The banner was draped across a Holocaust memorial at Congregation Sons of Israel in Lakewood, according to a tweet from the Anti-Defamation League, and included an anti-Semitic slur and a reference to a website that promotes white supremacist views.  The fliers had been placed on vehicles around the township, according to a report in the Asbury Park Press.  This is sickening, New Jersey Attorney General Christopher Porrino said in a tweet Sunday. The tweet also said there is a $10,000 reward for bias crime info and conviction, and seeking information and tips on the people responsible.  The flier, tweeted by the Anti-Defamation League, directly references the arrests and includes photos of some of the people arrested last week in what federal and local law enforcement has said is an ongoing investigation into public assistance fraud. Seven married couples, including a rabbi, were arrested in a pair of raids, accused of taking at least $2 million in assistance ranging from SNAP and utilities assistance to housing and Superstorm Sandy assistance, according to federal authorities and the Ocean County Prosecutors office.  Lakewood Police Chief Gregory Meyer told the Asbury Park Press that the department is working with state law enforcement and the prosecutors office on the case.  We will not tolerate this kind of behavior, Meyer said. We will look to prosecute all incidents of bias crimes that take place against our citizens.  Looking forward to outcome of @Lakewood_PD and @OC_PROS investigation, the Anti-Defamation League tweeted.

77,"SILVER SPRING, MD — Police are investigating a possible hate bias incident targeting a Muslim mother of four at a Silver Spring apartment building, according to the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR).  The unidentified mother told CAIR that the harassment first began in April when she came home to blue sticky notes on her apartment door saying she should quiet down her children.  The threatening sticky notes convey messages like, I see you and Keep those kids QUIET! Too much bumping. Will retaliate. I can hear you... They also depict derogatory words and satanic symbols.    Hoping the perpetrator would stop, the woman did not report the incident to authorities until June, when the tone of the notes became more hostile. She said the recent notes have made her increasingly fearful for her safety and that of her children.    Several notes have popped up on her door every month since April, she said.  A muslim woman believes she is being harassed, because of her religion. These are some of the notes that were posted on her door.

78,"The following letter to the editor was submitted to Patch by James W. Fee, Jr. To submit a letter to the editor please email justin.heinze@patch.com.  Dear Editor,  I am deeply disturbed by a crime allegedly committed by Barry Baker. Baker is accused of sucker punching a man with cerebral palsy outside a 7/11 in West Chester, Pa. This crime is of particular interest to me because I also have cerebral palsy and the man being punched could just as easily have been me. What disturbs me even more about this crime is that it seems that the DA in the case, a Tom Hogan, has charged the man with simple assault.  I believe the crime is more serious than this. If you view the video tap, recorded by the 7/11 security camera, you will note that the disabled man was first made fun of and then, for no reason, punched. I believe the man was punched because he belonged to a minority group, namely, disabled people with cerebral palsy.  I further believe that punching someone simply because they are disabled raises this to a crime at a much more serious level. I believe that Mr. Baker is guilty of a hate crime and I would like to see the DA, Tom Hogan charge him as such.  I am an out-of-state resident and do not have access to Penn. Senators or Congressmen. I wish some interested person reading this letter would please pass it along to anyone that can influence the DA s decision to charge Mr. Baker with what I believe he deserves, a hate crime!

79,"NAPERVILLE, IL -- Jewish deli Schmaltz Delicatessen in Naperville was vandalized on Fathers Day with an anti-Semitic message. The message was spray painted just outside the door. Police responded around 4:00 p.m.  Today sadly, our Fathers Day at Schmaltz Deli ended with a shocking crime when vandals spray painted a message intended to be anti-Semitic just outside our front door, a Schmaltz Facebook post says.  The vandalism took the form of the message free Gaza in black spray paint on the concrete outside the front door of Schmaltz. To Howard Bender, the delis owner, this was more than vandalism.  This is absolutely a hate crime, Bender said. [It] isnt about the statement, its about the targeting of a Jewish American business.  The Gaza Strip is a Palestinian territory which has been affected by a Israeli and Egyptian blockade for the past decade. The area has been a source of contention for decades.  Photo courtesy of Howard Bender  While non-violent, the vandalism is considered a hate crime. The FBI defines a hate crime as a criminal offense against a person or property motivated in whole or in part by an offenders bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender, or gender identity.    The Naperville Police Department confirmed that it is investigating the incident as a hate crime. Investigators are trying to obtain video surveillance.  Bender said he spent several hours cleaning the spray paint. Luckily, he said, the owner of the shoe repair shop next door came out with some chemicals to help dissolve the paint. We scrubbed and scrubbed. Black spray paint on concrete is not easy.  Being silent about things like this... is catastrophically wrong, he said. He noted that people have been desensitized to similar crimes in the recent past. Thats why Im speaking up about it.  The Facebook post, written by Bender, ends by saying Schmaltz Deli will continue to be a proud member of the Naperville community. We know this is not the true Naperville we are a part of, and that we have endless support from our customers and the rest of the community. We encourage everyone to be kind and reach out to those that are different from you. When we take the time to learn from each other, we are actively creating a more compassionate and loving society.

81,"CHICAGO, IL — An Oak Forest man is accused of leaving a threatening voicemail message in May for one of the officials at the Chicago branch of a Muslim-American advocacy group, a message that also included the callers phone number, the Chicago Triubne reports. Marvin Meyer, 45, was charged with a felony hate crime and a misdemeanor telephone threat. He was ordered held on $75,000 bail, and if released, Meyer must wear an electronic monitoring device, the report added.  According to prosecutors, Meyer said he called the Chicago office of Sufyan Sohel, deputy director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, on May 16, and he allegedly threatened to kill the official, as well as insulted his religion and the Democratic Party, the report stated. Through phone records, investigators determined that Meyer was the only person who had used the account, the report added.  In his message, Meyer allegedly addressed himself as America calling, and he allegedly told Sohel he was not welcome here before launching into an expletive-laden death threat telling him to return to Syria, the report stated.  We will kill you, Meyer allegedly said, according to the Tribune.    As for why Meyer left his phone number on the voicemail, prosecutors said he allegedly explained in the message: Do I seem afraid of you?    Sohel, who does not know Meyer, is a lawyer who was born in the United States after his parents immigrated to the country from India. He told the Tribune he was satisfied with the seriousness in which the Chicago Police Department handled his case, especially given the content of the message Meyer is accused of leaving:  His comments were very violent in nature, and he threatened to kill people, and that raised flags and that kind of shook me because when people use that sort of language, it made me both fearful for me and my team, but I also got a sense of being unwelcome in the only country that Ive ever called home.

83,"MIAMI, FL — A Miami Gardens man faces up to 25 years in prison after he was charged Thursday with a hate crime - making violent threats against a local mosque, say federal officials. Gerald Wallace, 35, is accused of calling the Islamic Center of Greater Miami on Feb. 19 and leaving a profanity-laced voicemail in which he threatened to shoot its members, according to a statement from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of Florida.  In the voicemail, Wallace criticized Islam, the prophet Mohammed and the Koran, and threatened to go to the mosque, and stated, Im gonna shoot all yall, the statement added.  A federal grand jury indicted Wallace Thursday on the hate crime charge of obstructing the free exercise of religious beliefs, said Benjamin Greenberg, Miamis chief federal prosecutor. Wallace, a security guard, also was indicted on May 25 for the interstate transmission of a threatening communication for making the threat against the mosque.  The iman of the mosque told WFOR-TV CBS4News that he hopes that Wallaces arrest and the hate crime charge will deter others from threatening Muslims. We were very disturbed by the message he left and our congregation was very scared, said Abdul Hamid Samra, the imam.  Wallace is in jail, and hes due back in court next week, CBS4News reported. If hes convicted of both charges, he faces a maximum of 25 years in federal prison, according to Greenberg. The case is being handled by the FBI and the Miami Gardens Police Department.

85,"PACIFIC PALISADES, CA — A Pacific Palisades charter school is again at the center of a criminal hate crime investigation after a black student was taunted with racial slurs and a doctored image of her being lynched. As first reported by KTLA, the harassment began shortly after 15-year-old Aina Shola Adewunmi transferred to Palisades Charter High School in January.  They were using the n-word, and I was like, OK, this is what this year is going to be like, she told KTLA.  Aina said a group of boys continued to make racist comments about her appearance. Then last month an image of her altered to look as if she had been lynched was circulated.  She told a KTLA reporter she felt more disgust than sadness, because everyone knows theres ignorant people in the world, and youre going to encounter them at any turn.  Aina reported to the incident to the school Principal Pam Magee, who issued a statement condemning the harassment.  The conduct of the students was egregious and contrary to the mission and values of our school, our students, our staff, and our community, and is not tolerated at PCHS. Although I cannot reveal discipline details due to privacy laws, I can confirm that the students who were involved in these acts have been disciplined, and will not be on the PCHS campus for at least the remainder of the current school year, Magee wrote. PCHS took immediate action as soon as it learned of the incident on May 23, and we are continuing to investigate the circumstances and other potential misconduct by the students. In addition to taking action to remove the students from the educational environment and provide education on why this is such a reprehensible act, various supports have been offered to and accepted by the victim. These efforts will continue to ensure her educational and other rights are protected.  However, Ainas mother said she still has concerns about the schools handling of the incident.  I need more, Tracy Adewunmi told KTLA. Initially during the mediation, when we suggested expulsion, they said no.  RELATED:  Ultimately, the incident was reported as a hate crime to the Los Angeles Police Department. Its the second time in a year, the police were called to deal with a race-related hate crime on the campus. Last year police arrested and cited students for spray-painting swastikas and references to gays and the KKK on campus.  For her part, Aina refuses to see herself as a victim.  I dont think Im a victim at all, she said. I think this was a hate crime, yes, but with the support Ive gotten from the people at this school, theres no such thing as a victim here. Its more like empowerment.  Click here to see the full KTLA story. Photo: KTLA Screengrab",1,0,3
86,"From CT Senate: Senator Gayle Slossberg and a bipartisan coalition of senators joined with community advocates and religious leaders today to announce that the Senate is prepared to approve a comprehensive bill aimed at strengthening Connecticuts hate crime laws, making them the strongest in the nation.  Over the last year, the United States has endured incidents of hate including murders, assaults, bomb threats and vandalism that have been directed against African-Americans, Hindu- Americans, Hispanics, Jews, Muslims, Sikh-Americans, transgender women and others.  Hate crimes divide our country, spreading fear and threatening to move our society backwards, said Senator Gayle Slossberg (D-Milford). By passing this bill today we are taking a stand against hate and those who would spread it. I was proud to stand in support of the religious, ethnic and social communities who have experienced threat of hate crimes. This bill makes a strong statement about Connecticuts values, and I hope the Governor will move swiftly and sign it into law without delay.  We will punish hate crimes appropriately and will have the strong hate crimes law in the nation, said Senate President Pro Tempore Martin M. Looney (D-New Haven). When a bomb threat is made against a religious community center or a religious cemetery is desecrated, or a mosque is vandalized, or women and the LGBT communities are specifically targeted, that is a crime that affects not just the members of the building and cemetery threatened or vandalized, but all members of the protected group throughout our society. Passing this bill will make Connecticut the national leader in the fight against these despicable acts, and serve as a model for other states looking to combat hate and crimes based on bigotry and bias.  I thank all the lawmakers and advocates who came here today to stand in unity against bigotry and prejudice. Together, in partnership with one another, we have the ability to pass legislation and send a strong message that Connecticut will protect all people, of all races, of all religions, of all ethnicities, of all sexual orientations and of all genders against hate, said Senate Republican President Pro Tempore Len Fasano (R-North Haven).  Across the United States, over the course of the last year, we have witnessed a disturbing spike in hate crimes, said Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff (D-Norwalk). Strengthening this law will ensure that, here in Connecticut, we will punish those who target communities based on race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity or disability.  This legislation will strengthen our criminal justice laws to send a clear message that Connecticut has zero tolerance for hate and violence directed at someone because of who they are, what they look like, or where they come from, said Deputy Senate Republican President Pro Tempore Kevin Witkos (R-Canton).  It is critical that we respond legislatively to the unacceptable increase in religious hate crimes we are seeing in our country, said Senator Paul Doyle (D-Wethersfield), Co-Chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Strengthening our hate crime laws to adequately punish the individuals who commit these horrific crimes also sends a clear message to others that these types of cowardly acts will not be tolerated and the punishment will fit the crime.  I want to extend a humble thank you to the entire Judiciary Committee for their hard-work on this important legislation, said Senator John A. Kissel (R-Enfield), Co-Chairman of the Judiciary Committee. As legislators we must work together to ensure that everyones rights are protected so that we can all live peacefully in our great state. I think this bill sends a clear message that as policymakers we will not tolerate threats or intimidation based on hate. I am proud to stand in support of this bipartisan legislation – legislation that works to protect all Connecticut residents against hate crimes.  On behalf of ADL leadership and supporters in Connecticut and across our nation, I wish to express profound gratitude to the Connecticut legislature, said Steve Ginsburg, Regional Director, Anti-Defamation League - Connecticut Region. ADL drafted the first ever model hate crimes statute, and now welcomes HB 5743 which, with overwhelming bipartisan support in both houses, will set an example for how - when unified - we can protect minorities, ensure our freedoms and strengthen democracy. Our state already had relatively strong hate crimes protections, but today our leaders made clear that when incidents of bias and hate are on the rise, good enough isnt good enough. Protecting community centers, including gender as a protected category and enhancing penalties makes all Connecticut residents and their communities safer and sets a proud example for our children. ADL will keep pushing until all 50 states have hate crimes laws (#50statesagainsthate), and we look forward to being a part of our states new Hate Crimes Advisory Council.  Passage of HB 5743 marks a major advancement in deterring hate crimes in the State of Connecticut. Elimination of such crimes requires additional steps that will help break down the barriers, misperceptions and prejudices that lead to such acts of intolerance, said Howard Sovronsky, Executive Director of the Hartford Jewish Federation. The Jewish Federation of Greater Hartford applauds the Legislature for this bold move and we continue our commitment to collectively work to stamp out hate where ever it appears.  House Bill 5743, An Act Concerning Hate Crimes:  Strengthens hate crime laws by increasing penalties, making it a felony (instead of a misdemeanor) for committing a hate crime against a group of persons (instead of a specific individual.)  Strengthens and modernizes Connecticuts hate crime laws to include hate crimes based on gender (sex). Current law protects only gender identity or expression, not gender.  Strengthens hate crime laws by increasing the penalty to a Class C felony (from a Class D felony) for making a bomb threat or other threat of violence against a house of worship, religious community center or other religious institution—or any daycare facility—if the threat is made with the intent to terrorize another person or to cause the evacuation of the building or grounds. This puts the penalty for such bomb threats on par with threats made against schools.  Strengthens hate crime laws by increasing the penalty for desecrating any house of worship or any religious cemetery from a Class A misdemeanor to a Class C felony if there is more than $10,000 in damage, or a Class D felony if there is less than $10,000 in damage.

87,"Hate crimes and incidents spiked following the election of President Donald Trump in November, according to figures in a staff report of the Orange County Human Relations Commission released Thursday.  The rise in racially charged incidents comes at a time when the Orange County Board of Supervisors is considering scrapping funding for OC Human Relations, the nonprofit that funds the commission.  Orange County officials asked for bids to run the commission, but OC Human Relations was the only organization that responded and staff recommended a $252,000 annual contract.  In April, Orange County Board Chair Michelle Steel and Supervisor Andrew Do has the proposed funding taken off the boards agenda for consideration.  Backers of OC Human Relations were girding for battle at Tuesdays board meeting to encourage supervisors to approve the contract. If they do not receive the funding, the commission faces eviction from its offices on Grand Avenue in Santa Ana.  Rabbi Richard Steinberg of Shir-Ha-Maalot synagogue in Irvine said the commissions relationship with the nonprofit has been a perfect public private partnership for three decades that has raised about $30 million for the commissions efforts to promote racial harmony.  I dont know what other peoples agendas are, Steinberg said of critics of the commission. All I know is our agenda. On the face of it the commission and nonprofit might look like a left of center organization, but all you have to look at for just 10 seconds are the 800 kids who come to a program on how to talk to each other. You can see the amazing work of the In My Shoes Program. Its anything but political. Its teaching people to talk to each other and be good citizens and fight for the underdog and oppressed. This is good stuff that brings people together.  The commission has come under fire from critics who have complained of Brown Act violations, among other things. Do told City News Service in April that there has been too much of a blurring of the lines between the nonprofit and the county agency.  We have absolutely no oversight in what theyre doing Do said, adding he supports the concept of a human relations agency.  The agency has offered training and education to many, according to their website.  We know that there are real divisions in our Country right now; real anger, real fears. We will not let these divisions defeat or take away from our core values and beliefs. We believe all people should live free of violence and discrimination and we believe in an Orange County that thrives, not despite our differences, but because of them. Alison Edwards, Deputy Director, OC Human Relations stated on their website.        There were 50 reported hate crimes last year in Orange County. Thats up from 44 in 2015, according to the commission.  The so-called hate incidents saw the most eye-popping increase. Those are defined as racially charged incidents that dont necessarily rise the level of a crime.  Last year, there were 72 reported hate incidents, up from 43 the prior year.  Blacks are the most frequent target of hate crimes in Orange County, despite only making up 2.1 percent of the countys population. Fourteen percent of the countys reported hate crimes involved black residents, according to the commission.  The second most targeted group was lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender residents, who accounted for 10 percent of the hate crimes  There was a drop in hate crimes against LGBT individuals from 11 in 2015 to five last year.  Hate crimes against Latinos doubled from two in 2015 to four last year. There was an increase from three to four in hate crimes against Asians.  Anti-Semitic hate crimes dropped from seven in 2015 to four last year. Christians were victims of three hate crimes.  The most common targets of hate incidents were Latinos and Muslims. Muslims accounted for 35 percent of the incidents and Latinos were victims 18 percent of the time.  Most of the hate incidents occurred in public -- about 33 percent of the time -- with schools being second most frequent arena for racially charged conflicts at 24 percent, according to the commission.  The commissions statistics will be published soon in an annual report.  City News Service Contributed To This Report    Photo: Youtube Video Screencapture",0,8,5
88,"EAST NEW YORK — Police are hunting for one of two men who hurled anti-gay slurs at a woman and cut her face with an umbrella.  The 38-year-old woman was standing outside a bodega near Miller Avenue and Fulton Street around 4:10 a.m. on Friday, May 26 when Alex Santiago, 26 and another man began screaming derogatory comments about her sexual orientation, police said.  The woman tried to walk away, but the two men followed her down the street screaming obscenities until she turned to confront them, said police.  At this point, one of the men grabbed an umbrella and struck her across the face with such force it slashed her left cheek, said police.  Both men fled, but officers arrested Santiago when the woman — who was later taken to Brookdale Hospital for her injuries — identified him on the street during a police canvass.  Santiago, of East New York, has been charged with assault as a hate crime, menacing and criminal possession of a weapon, among other charges, court records show.  Police are still searching for Santiagos companion, whom they describe as a man in his early twenties, standing five-foot-eight and weighing about 200 pounds, who was last seen wearing a blue baseball cap, white hoodie, jeans and blue sneakers.

89,"A homeless woman called a special needs aide racial slurs and assaulted her Thursday in New Hyde Park, police say.  According to authorities, a 28-year-old aide for a special needs group was at McDonalds, located at 2045 Jericho Turnpike, where she was approached by 45-year-old Jennifer Velez at 4 p.m. Police say Velez began calling the woman racial slurs and threatening her because she was black.  The aide got back in her car and drove westbound on Jericho Turnpike. At a stop light a short distance away, Velez exited her car and struck the woman on the left cheek, police say.  Velez fled the scene but was arrested on Astoria Boulevard in East Elmhurst following an investigation.  She was charged with third-degree assault (as a hate crime) and second-degree aggravated harassment. She will be arraigned Friday at First District Court in Hempstead.

90,"DARLINGTON, MD — Troopers are looking for two men and a truck after a possible hate crime was reported in Harford County. Police said that two white men in a black pickup truck with a Confederate flag ran a black driver off the road on US 1, assaulted him and taunted the driver with racial slurs.  The victim was driving a dark maroon Ford Focus on US 1/Conowingo Road north of Castleton Road when a pickup truck pulled up behind him and honked, authorities said. The incident occurred during the afternoon of Saturday, May 27.  The truck came up next to the Focus, at which point the duo inside lowered a window and yelled out racial slurs, according to officials.  They sped up and cut off the Focus, whose driver braked and swerved; as a result, his car hydroplaned and hit guardrails on both sides of the road, police said.  When he stopped to look at the damage, the men in the truck reportedly stopped and taunted him.  Police said the victim followed the truck on US 1 north to the Conowingo Swimming Pool — in the 4900 block of Conowingo Road — where both vehicles stopped.  The two men in the truck got out of their vehicle, addressed the Focus driver using racial epithets, pushed him to the ground and engaged in a physical fight, the victim told officials.  ...he said a fight ensued and he defended himself, apparently subduing both suspects, according to police.  The two men proceeded to get back into their truck and drive south on US 1, police said.  Authorities said the Focus driver did not require medical attention.    Suspect Information  The suspects were described as white men in their mid to late 20s who were approximately 5 feet 10 inches tall and 180 pounds.  One had some facial hair and was wearing a black t-shirt, blue jeans and a baseball hat.  The other was wearing a white t-shirt, blue jeans and a baseball hat as well, police said.  The suspect vehicle was described as a black pickup truck with a Confederate flag mounted in its long bed. Officials said the truck could have a dent on the front right bumper.  The victim was described as a 20-year-old black man from southeastern Pennsylvania. His identity is being protected for safety reasons, police said.  The victim and his father contacted Maryland State Police at the Bel Air barrack the evening of the incident, which authorities report may be classified as a hate crime.  The assault and taunting of a Pennsylvania man who was driving through Harford County earlier this week is being investigated as a potential hate crime, Maryland State Police said in a statement on Thursday, June 1. Troopers are asking for the publics help in identifying the suspects involved.  Have Tips?  Anyone who was near US 1 north of Castleton Road or by the entrance to the Conowingo Swimming Pool on Saturday, May 27, is asked to contact Maryland State Police investigators at 410-996-7813.

91,"This post was contributed by a community member.  As a constituent of Rep. Peter King, I would like to know why he has not yet condemned the murder of two Americans, a veteran and father of four and a recent college graduate, that were carried out by white supremacist, Jeremy Joseph Christian, a man with a public record of extremist ideology, according to the Portland Police.  Ricky Best, Taliesin Namkai-Meche, and Micah David-Cole Fletcher intervened when Christian started yelling what would best be characterized as hate speech toward a variety of ethnicities and religions toward two Muslim teenagers. Destinee Mangum, one of the teens targeted by Christian reported that he told us to go back to Saudi Arabia and he told us we shouldnt be here, to get out of his country. Christian stabbed the three men, killing Best and Namkai-Meche.  The murders happened hours before the start of Ramadan, a month long Muslim holy period of prayer, fasting and charity. Rep. King has said that The threat to this country is not Islamophobia, its Islamist terrorism. While King has called Islamophobia nonsense, there was a 67% increase in anti-Muslim hate crimes in 2015 according to the FBI, and the number of anti-Muslim hate groups nearly tripled in 2016.  I met with Rep. King this February and questioned his support of Donald Trumps Travel Ban. When King said that the Executive Order was not a Muslim Ban, I reminded him that the order specifically prioritized Christian refugees over Muslim refugees. He told me the logic in that would be, that if you know that a person is a Christian, you can assume theyre not an Islamic terrorist. If a Jew is coming from Nazi Germany, you can assume they were not Nazis.  Rep. King has urged President Trump to create a federal Muslim surveillance program. Both Kings and Trumps anti-Muslim rhetoric have fueled hate crimes, and allowed extremists to feel they have a voice in Congress and in the White House. Would Rep. King have already condemned the murder of two American heroes had they been killed while trying to protect two white women? Would he have spoken up if an undocumented immigrant or radical Islamic terrorist killed a veteran? Why is he silent now? As a constituent, I call on Rep. King to immediately and emphatically condemn this hate crime.  Liuba Grechen Shirley  Founder & District Organizer  New Yorks 2nd District Democrats",0,8,5
92,"Jeremy Christian, accused of stabbing three people, killing two during a hate-filled rant Friday afternoon, was defiant during his first court appearance Tuesday afternoon on charges of murder, attempted murder, and intimidation. You call it terrorism! I call it patriotism! he shouted at the packed courtroom.  In the courtroom was Micah Fletcher, a 21-year-old student at Portland State University who was one of three people that police say stood up to Christian when he started verbally assaulting two teens on the MAX Friday afternoon.  Free speech or die, Portland, Christian continued. You got no safe place.  Earlier Tuesday, it was disclosed that Christian had threatened to decapitate people and told a jail intake officer, If you dont like free speech, get the f--- out of my country.  That was included in court papers detailing some of the background of Christian, who is set to make his first appearance for the murders Tuesday afternoon. He currently faces charges including murder, attempted murder and intimidation under the Oregon hate crime statute.  According to the affidavit of Detective Michele Michaels, which was filed with the court, Christian is seen and heard on surveillance tape and cell phone video attacking the three men.  Michaels writes that she was told by Micah Fletcher, the man who survived, that Mr. Christian was yelling racial and religious epithets and threatened to decapitate people.  Christian, who has previous convictions of robbery and kidnapping — and was shot in the cheek once while fleeing a police officer — is homeless, unemployed and uses alcohol weekly, according to court records. He told intake officials at the jail as he was being booked that hes not sure the last time he had a permanent address.    Christian had been living with his parents in North Portland.  The documents indicate that Christian has not had any mental health treatment. He did say that he had attended treatment for marijuana in 2012 when he was released from federal prison.  Christian was placed in isolation.  On Friday night, police said, Christian started screaming racist invectives toward two teenage girls, one of whom is Muslim and was wearing a hijab.    When three men tried to intervene, witnesses say Christian stabbed them in their throats. One died at the scene, one at the hospital. The third man survived and was released from the hospital on Monday.  Portland Police and the FBI continue to look into Christian, trying to determine whether he acted alone as well as exploring what led up to the attack.  The night before the murders, police said Christian was involved in a different altercation — also on the MAX train — at the Rose Quarter station. Christian allegedly threw a bottle of Gatorade at a woman who is black. She then sprayed him with mace. Later that evening, he was back on the MAX, police said.  Witnesses said Christian was very angry, complaining about Muslims, Christians and Jews. He said they should burn at the stake and spoke about wanting to stab people. The driver was informed but it appears that police were not informed until later.  A grand jury is expected to start hearing the case by the end of the week. Christian was appointed a court-appointed lawyer. He is due back in court June 7th.  VICTIMS MOTHER PLEADS WITH TRUMP    The mother of one of two people murdered while defending teens against a racist attack is pleading with President Trump to take action against action against hatred.  You have said that you will be President for all Americans, Asha Deliverance, whose son Taliesin Myrddin Namkai Meche was killed on Friday, wrote in an open letter to the president she posted on her Facebook page. So, I ask you Mr. President to take action at this time. Your words and actions are meaningful, here in America and throughout the world.  Please encourage all Americans to protect and watch out for one another. Please condemn any acts of violence, which result directly from hate speech & hate groups. I am praying you will use your leadership to do so.  Deliverance writes that her son died a hero. He was just 23, a year out of college with a degree in economics, working, had just bought his first home and was thinking about starting a family.  Our family grieves, but we are proud that through his selfless action he, along with the other two men, has changed the world, when in the face of hate he did not hesitate to act with love.  WHITE HOUSE RESPONDS  While the White House has not responded to Deliverances letter, on Monday — 60 hours after the incident — they did respond to what had happened; though its still not clear if the response was from the president or a staffer.  On Monday morning was the first comment from the White House in a tweet from the POTUS account.    The violent attacks in Portland on Friday are unacceptable. The victims were standing up to hate and intolerance. Our prayers are w/ them. — President Trump (@POTUS) May 29, 2017  While the statement is strong, its not clear if the tweet is from the president or his staff. Trump maintains two Twitter accounts, the @realDonaldTrump account that gets the most notice and the @POTUS account.  The tweet was sent at 10:51 EST. Just five minutes earlier he had arrived at Arlington National Cemetery for the Memorial Day observance and was walking to where he would be participating in a ceremony.  The White House has not responded to a question about whether the tweet was from the president or staff.  MAYOR WANTS DEMONSTRATION CANCELED    Mayor Ted Wheeler is pleading with organizers of two upcoming alt-right rallies planned for Portland to postpone or cancel their plans. Short of that, the mayor said, he hopes the federal government, which has issued permits for the rallies, will revoke the permits.  Wheeler said the city needs a cooling-off period. He said that in the wake of Fridays incident where three men were stabbed — two of them killed — defending two teens who were being subjected to a racist attack, now is not the time for an alt-right protest.  Our city is in mourning, our communitys anger is real, and the timing and subject of these events can only exacerbate an already difficult situation, Wheeler said Monday. Our community remains in shock.  Watch: Portland Teen Targeted In Attack Thanks Saviors  I am appealing to the organizers of the alt-right demonstrations to cancel the events they have scheduled for June 4th and June 10th, Wheeler continued. I urge them to ask their supporters to stay away from Portland at this difficult time.  Wheeler is referring to two demonstrations planned for the federally-controlled area of Terry Schrunk Plaza, where the federal courthouse is. The mayor said that given the rawness of emotions in the city right now, he would like the federal government to withdraw the permit for the June 4 event and not issue one for June 10.  The Oregon chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union says Wheelers approach is a mistake and violates the First Amendment.  The government cannot revoke or deny a permit based on the viewpoint of the demonstrators, it said in a statement.  Our hearts are broken, but government censorship is not the answer, the chapters legal director, Mat dos Santos, said. We must defend the constitution even when it is uncomfortable.  HELPING THE FAMILIES    Meanwhile, fundraising continues for the victims of Fridays incident and their families.  The page set up by Portland restaurateur Nick Zukin to help the families of the two men who were killed has now raised $496,616 from 9,750 people.  A page set up to help Micah Fletcher, who survived, has raised $228,407 from 6,746 people.  A page set up to help the two girls who were the target of the vitriol that inspired three men to intervene has raised $29,865 from 915 people.

93,"The night before Jeremy Christian allegedly stabbed three people - killing two - police say that he was involved with an altercation, also on the MAX train. It happened at the Rose Quarter station.  Christian allegedly threw a bottle of Gatorade at a woman who is black. She then sprayed him with mace.  Later that evening, he was back on the MAX, police say.  Witnesses said he was very angry, complaining about Muslims, Christians, and Jews. He said they they should burn at the stake and spoke about wanting to stab people. The driver was informed but, it appears, that police were not informed until later.  Police are investigating that as well as the Friday night incident.  Meanwhile, people from all over Portland make their way to the scene of the killings.  Karen and Sean Scherlie live just a few blocks from the Hollywood Transit Center. On Sunday, they were among the hundreds who continued to make the trek, trying to make some sort of sense out of the incident on Friday that started with two teens being targeted by hatred and ended with two men dead, a third hospitalized, and city struggling.  The couple - both of whom are in their 50s - have lived their whole lives in the city. They say theyve seen good and bad. But this, they say, is different.  I guess I just wanted to be here, to experience things, try to make sense of what happened, Karen says. But, really, there is no making sense of it.  Sean says he wanted to see the outpouring. It is very powerful what is going on. The messages that people leave. I was listening to one father trying to explain things to his son.  It is a lifelong message.  There is not one memorial at the transit center. Several have popped up, reflective of the fact that it was a very fluid scene on Friday when police say that Jeremy Christian screamed invective at two teenage girls - one of whom is Muslim - and when three men tried to intervene, he stabbed them, killing two.  About twenty yards from the Scherlies, a mom in her early thirties is talking to her son, who is eight.  You know how I told you when someone is at a bully at school, it is important to say something? she says, looking to him for some sort of recognition. If someone tries to be a bully, let your teacher know.  Sarah Adams, 28, arrives at the Transit Center from North Portland, herself having been the victim of bullying, intimidation.  I wanted to come last night, she says of the vigil that took place, drawing thousands. But the thought of that many people seemed too much.  So, I came today. On my own.  Adams says that she feels it is important to pay her respects.  There are so many bad things that happen, so many things in this world, she says. And then to have an instance where people stood up, did the right thing and lost their lives in the process...  Adams takes a deep breath as her eyes tear up a little.  I wanted to feel the pain that was here, she says. I wanted to say thank you to these people. I wanted to connect with others who are feeling the same thing.  She is trying to make sense of things.  Im not sure that anything could have been done to stop this from happening, she says. There are so many issues that we need to confront and maybe this gives us a starting point.  Im white and I can say without question that we - Portland - needs to work harder to make sure that people of color are treated better here. We need to do more to combat day-to-day discrimination because it leads to hatred.  Wendy Binion, 47, looks at one of the circles of flowers and candles that have sprung up with a sense of anger and frustration.  We need to call this what it is, she says. It is racism. It is hatred. It is terrorism.  Hate speech is not free speech and should not be protected.  Binion is mad that Portland had allowed a march to go on last month - one where Christian spewed hatred and gave the Nazi salute.  The city needs to take a stronger stand with these people, she says.  As angry as she is, there is something that gives her - and others hope - the actions of Rick Best and Taelisin Myrddin Namkai-Meche, who were killed, and Micah Fletcher, who was stabbed and is expected to survive.  They all stood up and did the right thing, she says. They put themselves in harms way for people they did not know.  That this happened, that these people live in Portland does not surprise me.  Sam, a 35-year-old nurse from Southeast Portland who did not want to give her last name, feels the same way.  Its complicated and I am still trying to figure out exactly how I feel, she says. But I know this is not just the story of these individuals, that there are bigger issues at play.  The city that made these people stand up for others is also the city that helped make the person who committed the crime. There is much to be sorted out.

94,"PORTLAND, OR — Three men were stabbed Friday, two of them fatally, as they tried to de-escalate a situation involving a man who was yelling racial slurs at two young, apparently Muslim, women, police said.  Jeremy Joseph Christian, 35, has been arrested and charged with two counts of murder, one count of attempted murder and other crimes. Christian is being held at the Multnomah County Jail without bail. Hes accused of stabbing three men, killing two of them. He is also charged with intimidation under the Oregon hate crime statute.  The deadly stabbings took place on Friday, the start of the Muslim month of fasting known as Ramadan. Just after 4 p.m. on Friday, according to witnesses, a man on an eastbound MAX train was ranting and screaming hate speech directed at a variety of ethnicities and religions.  The man, identified as Christian, turned his vitriol toward two young women - one of whom was wearing a hijab - and people tried to intervene and get the man to calm down, police said. He then turned on three of them, stabbing them repeatedly, police said.  THE INCIDENT    Dyjuana Hudson tells Patch the young women were her daughter Destinee who is 16 and a friend of hers, a 17-year-old who is Muslim and wearing a hijab.  This random white guy sits down and he starts talking and ranting about how he feels that Christians should die and Muslims should die, she says. He comes running up on them and two guys stood up for them.  To know that those guys put their lives on the line for my girls is really sickening, Hudson says.  Christian stabbed each of the men in the neck.  Hudson says her daughter and her friend were coming home from school when the attack happened. Once the train stopped, they ran - so quickly that they left their purses on the train - and called her, telling her, though sobs, what had happened.  She raced to the station and they called police.    She says her daughter is not doing well, knowing that two men gave their lives to protect her.  It is a lot for her, says Hudson.  THE ARREST    As the train pulled into the Hollywood Transit Center, Christian fled toward Providence Hospital but was quickly apprehended.  The arrest was captured on video by Larry Blackwood, who had been on the train and gave chase to help make sure Christian did not get away. He posted it to his Facebook page. Watch the video but CAUTION - there is graphic language.  THE GOOD SAMARITANS    One of the good Samaritans died at the scene and another died at the hospital. The third man is expected to survive.  Police identified those who were killed as 23-year-old Taelisin Myrddin Namkai-Meche of Southeast Portland and 53-year-old Ricky John Best of Happy Valley.  Also stabbed was 21-year-old Micah David Cole Fletcher of Southeast Portland. He remains in the hospital being treated for what are believed to be non-life threatening injuries.  REED GRADUATE    Namkai-Meches mother praised her son.  He was a hero and will remain a hero on the other side of the veil, says Asha Deliverance. Shining bright star I love you forever.  Nankai-Meche graduated from Reed College last year with a degree in economics. He was working for the Cadmus Group, a technology and consulting company based in Massachusetts. He worked on environmental consulting.  Reed College released a statement calling the incident shocking and horrific and offering memories of Nankai-Meche.  I remember where he sat in conference and the types of probing, intelligent questions I could anticipate him asking, said Professor Kambiz GhaneaBassiri.  He was thoughtful, smart, humble, inquisitive, and compassionate.  Now he is a hero to me.  Hudson said she reached out to Deliverance offering thanks and saying that if she needed anything to reach out.  He died at the hospital.  AN ARMY VETERAN    The other person killed - Ricky Best - is a 23-year veteran of the U.S. Army who retired in 2012 as a sergeant. He then went to work for the city of Portland and has been a supervisor with the Bureau of Development Services.  He was on his way home to Happy Valley after work. He died on the train as Christian fled the scene.  Best, who has four children, ran for Clackamas County Commission in 2014.  He provided distinguished services to the residents of Portland, said Mayor Wheeler.  City Commissioner Chloe Eudaly said that the citys human resources department wil make sure there are counselors available for BDS employees when they return to work on Tuesday.  My heart goes out to the family of Rick Best, Eudaly said. They have lost a husband and a father, and we have lost a treasured employee.  As a veteran, he served our country with honor and distinction. He stood up for two young women and others he didnt even know - all because he wanted to help.  THE POET    Micah David-Cole Fletcher, 21, is the third stabbing victim. He is expected to survive. Fletcher - who was on his way to his job at a pizza place - is a student at Portland State University and graduated from Madison High School.    He was stabbed in the neck with such force that his jaw was broken and there were pieces of bone in his throat.  He is expected to recover.  In 2013, he won first place in the annual Verselandia poetry slam contest. One of his poems is about the discrimination that Muslims face. You can watch video of him at Verselandia below. He performs twice - at 2:03 and at 2:32.    HELP FOR THE FAMILIES  Portland restaurant owner Nick Zukin - of Mi Mero Mole and Kenny and Zukes - has started a GoFundMe page to help the families of the heroes.    They are heroes, yet their families are not only going to be faced with the pain of losing people they love, but with financial hardships from their passings, says Zukin. Hopefully the goal is just a starting point.  They will certainly need more than this. And no amount of money will ever lessen their heartbreak.  In 24 hours, the campaign had raised $201,210 from 4,270 people.  A campaign has also been set up to help Fletcher pay his medical bills. In 22 hours, 2,082 people had contributed $70,259.  Meanwhile, a separate campaign has been started to raise money for the two teens who were the target of Christians vitriol.  FBI ASSISTANCE    The FBIs Portland Office said its helping the Portland Police with the investigation.    Portland Police is the lead investigative agency and we are honored to support their investigation in any way we can, said Loren Cannon, special agent-in-charge of the FBIs Portland office. Its too early to say whether last nights violence was an act of domestic terrorism or a federal hate crime.  However, in the coming days, the FBI, PPB and the prosecutors will work together to share information, leverage resources and make determinations about future criminal charges. We wont allow these acts to go unanswered.  THE SUSPECT  Christian is expected to appear in court on Tuesday.  He has a criminal record that includes felony convictions for robbery and kidnapping.  In November 2002, he was convicted of robbery, kidnapping, and carrying or using a dangerous weapon.      The charges stemmed from an incident in May of that year in which he robbed a market in North Portland, handcuffing the owner and stealing cash. Christian was shot in the cheek by an officer as he fled.  The Portland Mercurys Doug Brown, who closely tracks the white supremacist movement in the region, reports that Christian is a known right wing extremist and white supremacist who showed up at a free speech march last month with a baseball bat and tried to assault left wing protesters.    Brown reports that he yelled racial slurs and frequently gave the Nazi salute.  Christian was captured on video doing just that by reporter Mike Bivins.  Man engaging in hate speech and giving the Nazi salute at the end of the #Portland free speech march pic.twitter.com/8QRmmvTDAf  — Mike Bivins (@itsmikebivins) April 29, 2017  As Brown first pointed out, Christian writes posts on his Facebook page that include anti-Semitic and other comments.    He has also praised Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh as a patriot, threatened violence against people, and declared, I AM TROUBLE.  In another post with the hashtag #BalkanizetheUSA, he advocated for the Pacific Northwest to be made into a Whites-only homeland.  So, its like this. If you support Israel for Zionist homeland for Jews then you should also support Cascadia as a White homeland for whites only racists, Alabama and Mississippi for Nation of Islam and racist Black Power groups and give back at least so cal [Southern California] to Mexicans for all the illegal Latinos and any Brown racist peeps, he wrote.  Christian is listed as living in North Portland in a home owned by his parents.    CITY LEADERS REACT    Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler had been on the inaugural flight from Portland to London when the attack happened. Once he arrived in London, he boarded the next flight back.    Wheeler then joined other city leaders and law enforcement officials for an afternoon press conference.    They were attacked because they did the right thing, Wheeler said. Their actions were brave and selfless and should serve as an example and inspiration to us all. They are heroes.  U.S. Attorney Billy Williams vowed There is a day of reckoning coming. There will be a day of accountability.  The Council on American-Islamic Relations is asking President Trump to denounce the attack.  President Trump must speak out personally against the rising tide of Islamophobia and other forms of bigotry and racism in our nation that he has provoked through his numerous statements, policies and appointments that have negatively impacted minority communities, said CAIR National Executive Director Nihad Awad.  Only a strong statement from the nations leader will send a message to bigots that such acts of violence targeting racial, ethnic or religious minorities are unacceptable.  Patch has reached out four times to the White House for comment but has yet to receive a response.  Brian Bendis, who works for Marvel Comics and lives in Portland, a few blocks from where the incident happened, said that the next issue of Spider-man will be dedicated to Best and Nankai-Meche.    TriMet General Manager Neil McFarlane also released a statement praising the men.  These men are true heroes for coming together to the defense of strangers, he said. In this anguishing time, lets come together with a renewed pledge to respect and care for one another as we know we should.  Portland Fire and Rescue, meanwhile, tweeted out a simple message.  THOUSANDS TURN OUT FOR VIGIL    Your sons were champions of justice, Senator Jeff Merkely said to the mothers who lost sons on Friday.    Hundreds showed up - from an Army veteran who spoke of losing a brother in reference to Best to relatives of those killed - to honor those who were stabbed and to call for unity, to argue that the response of the good Samaritans is more representative of Portland than the racist vitriol that led to them trying to intervene.  The crowd was silent as Namkai-Meches family spoke.  His mother said her son had a heart as big as the world.  We taught him to love everyone and thats what we should all be doing and thats what we should all be doing and thats why were all here, so give it up for love.  His sister spoke of how he loved his new job and his girlfriend and how they wanted to make babies and start a family.  At one point, things took a nasty turn. A speaker started attacking Mayor Wheeler, claiming hes not done enough to stop fascism.    That led to screams and curses directed toward Wheeler. At which he point, he left the area where the speakers were and moved to a different section.  THE INVESTIGATION CONTINUES  Multnomah County District Attorney Rod Underhill and U.S. Attorney for Oregon Billy Williams joined Portland Police Chief Michael Marshman at the afternoon press conference. None wanted to go into detail about the investigation but all stressed the ultimate decision about whether it will be a federal or state case will be decided based on what the strongest possible outcome is.    A county grand jury is expected to start hearing evidence in the case by next Friday.  Have you been a victim to or have witnessed a hate crime? Tell your story here.

95,"CROFTON, MD — Prosecutors have filed hate crime charges against men from Crofton and Pasadena for allegedly climbing up on the roof of Crofton Middle School to hang a noose, a symbol of racial strife and violence. Anne Arundel County Police on May 12 arrested Conner Charles Prout, 19, of Crofton, and John Adam Havermann, 19, of Pasadena for allegedly hanging the racially-tinged object.  Both suspects were originally charged with trespass on posted property, trespass on school property, disturbing school operations and disorderly conduct - disturbing the peace. Anne Arundel County States Attorney Wes Adams said Wednesday that after evaluating the evidence his office has added counts of race/religious belief - harass/commit a crime upon and con-race/religious belief - harass/commit a crime upon to the case against the two men.  Nooses have been reported as symbols of racial unrest in recent weeks at both the University of Maryland and American University. No arrests have been made in either of those cases.  The school principal told parents in a letter May 11 that the action sent a disturbing and intolerant message to the community.  I am very proud of the hard work our detectives put in to solving this case. I am hopeful that this swift arrest offers at least some degree of closure for the students, faculty and staff at the Crofton Middle School, Police Chief Timothy Altomare said in a statement. There is no place in our community for the sentiment communicated by such an act, and we will always give 100 percent effort to bring to justice anyone who commits a crime espousing hateful ideology.  A teacher spotted the noose hanging from a light fixture on the exterior of the building about 11 a.m. May 11 at the school, 2301 Davidsonville Road in Crofton. A school custodian immediately took the object down and police were called.  Principal Nuria Miller said in a letter to parents that the incident is clearly disturbing on many levels. While it appears to have no connection to our instructional day or any instructional unit our students are currently studying, we cannot ignore the intolerant message this act conveys.  She vowed that the incident will not change the inclusive and supportive school community.  Police spokesman Lt. Ryan Frashure previously told Patch that no note was left with the noose and police are still trying to determine the exact motive of the suspects. But police obviously know the powerful visual meaning that is associated with a noose, Frashure said.  Detectives watched video surveillance from the school and say the two suspects gained access to the buildings roof and placed the noose on the light fixture.  The full text of Principal Millers letter to parents:  May 11, 2017  Dear Parents and Guardians:  I am writing to let you know about a most disturbing incident that occurred at our school today. Shortly before 11 a.m., a teacher reported to our administration that there was a noose hanging in front of a window that looks out on our courtyard.  The noose was hung from an exterior light and was in front of a window of a teacher planning room. It was also visible to students who could look into the courtyard from other classrooms.  We immediately called county police, and asked a custodian to remove the noose. That was done within minutes of our becoming aware of it.  We, along with police, are continuing to investigate this incident in an effort to determine how the noose came to be placed on the light. While I cannot discuss specifics of this active investigation, we believe at this point that the noose was placed on the light last night by someone who gained access to the roof of our building. We do not believe this event happened during our school day.  This incident is clearly disturbing on many levels. While it appears to have no connection to our instructional day or any instructional unit our students are currently studying, we cannot ignore the intolerant message this act conveys.  I addressed our students before school dismissed today and reassured them that they are safe and supported in our school. I also want to assure you that we have resources available for any student or adult who has a need to discuss their feelings about this matter. I also am more than willing to address it – to the extent that I am able – at our Coffee with the Principal event scheduled for 9 a.m. Saturday at the school.  If you have any information that could help in our investigation, please call our school or county police.  We pride ourselves on being an inclusive and supportive school community. We will not let this incident change that, and we will continue to work with county police to try and ascertain who the culprits are.

Alberto Campos was arrested at his home on Julian Avenue Saturday in connection with the attack off the 2200 block of Imperial Avenue on the night of April 15.  Campos allegedly hurled racial slurs at the victim during the beating, which left the 56-year-old man, who is black, with an injury to his ear that required surgery, according to San Diego police.

97,"CONTRA COSTA COUNTY, CA — Two Texas men have been sentenced to three years in state prison after they pleaded no contest Thursday to felony assault and a hate crime enhancement for a 2016 attack in Richmond, according to Contra Costa County District Attorney Mark Peterson.  Chase Little and Colton Leblanc were accused of attacking Maan Singh Khalsa, a Richmond resident and observer of the Sikh faith, prosecutors said.  On Sept. 25, Khalsa was stopped at a red light at Hilltop Road, dressed in traditional Sikh clothes and on his way to a religious ceremony when Little and Leblanc started throwing beer cans at his vehicle, prosecutors said.  The two men then exited their pickup truck, repeatedly punched the victim in the face, removed his turban and cut his unshorn hair, a sacred article of his faith, prosecutors said.  During the assault, Khalsa suffered a swollen black eye, damaged teeth and several knife wounds to his left hand.  One of the wounds required stitches, and due to an infection from the knife wound, Khalsas pinky finger had to be amputated.  — Bay City News; Image via Shutterstock  Also See:",1,3,0
98,"LAKE FOREST, CA — A 25-year-old Irvine man was sentenced Wednesday after being charged in a racially motivated attack from March of 2016. Christopher Qu, who has been behind bars since his arrest in March 30, 2016, was immediately placed on three years of formal probation. He was released from Central Mens Jail, Thursday.  Qus charges stemmed from the racially charged attack on a black teen and his older brother. However, the plea bargain keeps the 25-year-old Irvine man off the streets and in the custody of the Public Guardians Office to receive mental health treatment.  The bottom line is both the district attorney and the defense and court all worked together in order to make sure that the public was protected and that Mr. Qu received the mental health treatment that he needs, Qus attorney, Lee Blumen, said.  The Public Guardians Office evaluated him and found that he qualified to be placed on an involuntary conservatorship and receive inpatient treatment.  Qu pleaded guilty to assault with a deadly weapon, a felony, and a misdemeanor hate crime, according to court records. A count of assault with force likely to produce great bodily injury with sentencing enhancements for a hate crime were dismissed as part of the plea deal.  Qu approached a 16-year-old student at just before 1 p.m., March 30, 2016, at Irvine High School while the teen was waiting for a ride from his brother, according to Irvine police.  A pipe-wielding Qu spewed racial slurs at the boy, who was on campus for sports practice while the school was on spring break, and was advancing on the teen when his 24-year-old sibling drove up, police said.  Qu banged the pipe against several railings as he advanced on the teen, according to the Orange County District Attorneys Office.  The brother got out of the car in time to intervene, but Qu head-butted the man and slammed the pipe against his arm several times.  The victim sustained a broken nose and bruises on his arms, prosecutors said. His brother was unhurt.  City News Service contributed to this report.    Irvine Police Photo",1,0,0
99,"The West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals ruled this week that the states hate crime statute does not cover attacks that may be motivated by a persons sexual orientation.  At issue was whether attacks motivated by a persons sex, which are covered in the states statute, extended to include attacks motivated by sexual orientation.  The case at the center of the ruling involves a former Marshall University football player Steward Butler. In April 2015, Butler allegedly punched and hurled homophobic slurs towards two men whom he saw kissing on the sidewalk. Butler was charged with two counts of battery and two counts of violations of an individuals civil rights.  A circuit court in West Virginia dismissed the two civil rights violations charges against Butler, ruling that the word sex in West Virginia Code was plain and unambiguous and could not be expanded to include sexual orientation.  The state argued that the lower court erred when it dismissed the counts based on its erroneous determination that the word sex could not be expanded to include sexual orientation. In the opinion, written by Chief Justice Allen H. Loughry, the Supreme Court says the word sex in West Virginia code is undefined and the court has previously addressed undefined words. Citing a case where the court addressed the words force and threat, relying on precedent, the ordinary meanings were ascribed to both words.  Loughry cited hate crime laws in different states, noting that sex and sexual orientation are being treated as distinct categories. The opinion also notes that the West Virginia state legislature has failed on 26 separate occasions to include sexual orientation in the statute since it was first enacted in 1987, writing that this was indicative of the legislatures intent to not include the term.  The opinion states that through the application of the presumption that legislature said what it meant and meant what it said in the statute, and based upon the common and plain meaning of the word sex and the legislatures clear intent, we are left with the ineluctable conclusion that the word sex does not include sexual orientation. The ruling was 3-to-2.  Image courtesy West Virgina Judiciary  ",0,8,5
100,"MIAMI BEACH, FL — A 45-year-old man told police he was called gay slurs and beaten unconscious as he walked his dog during the evening rush hour on Friday night. Kevin Wilcox suffered internal injuries, a concussion and broken ribs in the daylight attack. His two attackers could be charged with a hate crime.  The victim stated the crime took place Friday evening. He sought treatment Saturday and reported the crime to police Sunday morning, Ernesto Rodriguez of the Miami Beach Police Department told Patch on Sunday night. As with any investigation, the crime itself is investigated. Upon arrest, the complete findings are presented to the State Attorneys Office who then determines if they will prosecute as a hate crime.  Wilcox told police he was unconscious for about three hours on Friday following the 5 p.m. attack. He said the attack occurred at 14 Street and Meridian Avenue near Flamingo Park.  Wilcox told police that he was walking his dog on the west side of 14 Street when the two men called him a gay slur as they crossed paths. Wilcox kept walking when one of the men grabbed him from behind and the other punched him repeatedly in the face and body.

102,"HIGHTSTOWN, NJ — The Civil Rights Cold Case Record Collections Act of 2017 may have been introduced by an Illinois Congressman, but it has a heavy local flavor. The bill, introduced by Rep. Bobby Rush (D-Illinois), was ghost-written several Hightstown students. It addresses unsolved hate crimes.  The bill was introduced on March 1. After that, juniors and seniors at the high school persuaded Rep. Bonnie Watson-Coleman (D-12) to sign on as a co-sponsor, according to The Trentonian. They also visited Republicans in D.C. to ask them to support the bill.    The purpose of the bill is to make it easier for private investigators to solve civil rights cold cases. The U.S. Department of Justice has been directed to solve all cases in which the victims were killed or disappeared as the result of racially motivated crimes before 1980, according to the report.    However, very few cases have actually been solved, in part because it is difficult to obtain information from the federal government. A private citizen can request information via the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), but those requests often take more than a year to fill, and often return heavily redacted, or censored.  In 2013, the Justice Department reported that about 83 percent of information provided to private citizens was wrongfully redacted.    Students in Stuart Stu Wexlers AP government and politics class at Hightstown High School decided to craft the proposed legislation, but Wexler is surprised by how far the legislation has advanced, according to the report.    The bill was introduced on March 1, and assigned to a congressional committee. According to Predict Gov, it has about a 2 percent chance of being enacted.

105,"GREENBELT, MD — A hate crime charge has been filed against Sean Urbanski, a former University of Maryland student accused of fatally stabbing 2nd Lt. Richard Collins III on campus, a Prince Georges County grand jury decided Tuesday.  Urbanski, 22, of Severna Park, was also charged with the murder of Collins in July. Collins, a 23-year-old Bowie State University student who wouldve been a U.S. Army officer, was killed while visiting the university May 20. Initially, police didnt think race had anything to do with the attack, but that changed when they found out Urbanski was a member of a racist Facebook group called Alt-Reich Nation.  Collins, who was set to graduate from Bowie State University the week of his death, was visiting the University of Maryland with friends on May 20. Police were called to the campus at Regents Drive near Montgomery Hall at around 3 a.m. to a report of an assault with a knife.  Alse See: UMD Student Stunned After Fatal Stabbing  Officers immediately responded to the area and located the male victim on the sidewalk suffering from serious injuries, the university statement reads. Officers provided medical assistance until paramedics arrived. The victim was taken to a local hospital where he was later pronounced deceased by medical staff.  Prince Georges County Police later stopped Urbanski near that location and identified him as the person behind the attack.  See Also:  The Baltimore Sun reports that Urbanski warned Collins, who had just been commissioned as an officer in the Army on Thursday after four years in the ROTC program, to step left, step left if you know whats good for you based on charging documents. Collins reportedly refused, and Urbanski stabbed him in the chest.    When I look at the information thats contained on that website, suffice it to say that its despicable, it shows extreme bias against women, Latinos, persons of Jewish faith and especially African-Americans, University Police Chief David Mitchell said, according to the Sun.  A hate crime charge carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, but Urbanski could be sentenced to life without parole if he is convicted of murder.

106,"COATESVILLE, PA — A black baby doll was found hanging by a noose from a locker room at a Chester County high school, but school authorities are not calling the incident an intentional hate crime.  Cathy Taschner, the Superintendent of the Coatesville Area School District, said in a statement that the incident was not racially motivated and was a prank that went too far.    The district said that the doll was found in a trash can on Sept. 1 by members of the Coatesville cross country team.  The team members threw the doll around like a ball, and said that it would become their new mascot or team angel, according to school officials.  A coach took the doll and threw it away again, but team members took it back out of the trash and stashed it in an open ceiling tile in the locker room, the school said.  The doll remained there for several weeks until a member of the team used his tie as noose and hung the doll from the locker room ceiling. Thats how the doll was recently discovered, smeared with toothpaste.  Taschner said that school officials interviewed the team and determined that their intention was to pull a foolish prank, and not racial intimidation.    She added, however, that we cannot accept that reasoning. This incident is offensive, insensitive, and not reflective of the kind of behavior we accept or will tolerate from our students.  The district said that they would be meeting with team members and parents to determine disciplinary action in the coming days. No punishment has yet been determined.  Patch file photo  ",1,0,3

108,"LOS ANGELES, CA — Hate crimes in the city of Los Angeles hit multi- year highs in 2016 , according to an analysis released Tuesday by Cal State San Bernardino researchers, who pegged the overall increase at 15 percent.  The report by the universitys Center on Hate & Extremism found that last years increase to 230 hate crimes, from 200 in 2015, was driven in large part by a 64 percent surge in violent aggravated assaults, an 18.5 percent rise in racially motivated crimes and a 24.5 percent increase in crimes against the LGBGT community.  Catalytic or national events can impact the number of hate crimes, but so do local events, economics and individual conflicts at the neighborhood level, said Brian Levin, director of the CSULB center. Its a combination of things.  At the same time, religious hate crimes against Jews and Muslims declined significantly in the city during the period, the researchers found. There have been no bias homicides reported by the Los Angeles Police Department in the last two years.  By comparison, aggravated assaults overall in the city during 2016 rose about 10 percent, and the number of robberies increased 13 percent.  The city of Los Angeles prides itself on being a multicultural haven, said Dr. Kevin Grisham, the centers assistant director for research. Its troubling to see significant increases in these crimes.  Of the localities surveyed, Los Angeles had the third-largest number of hate crimes in the nation, with only New York and Boston reporting more, the researchers said.  The three dozen reported aggravated assaults include physical attacks with a weapon or attacks capable of producing serious bodily injury. Hate crimes are criminal acts motivated in significant part by the actual or perceived group characteristic of another such as race, religion and sexual orientation.  For Los Angeles, the 2016 hate crime totals were the highest since 2008, when the city recorded 280 hate crimes. While 2016 marked the third annual consecutive increase, last years totals are still far below various highs tallied in recent decades.  In 2001, the year of the 9/11 terror attacks, Los Angeles had 559 hate crimes, the highest number so far this century. In 1992, official data did not accurately include the 60-plus people killed and others injured in rioting following the state trial acquittal of the officers involved in the videotaped Rodney King police beating, according to the report.  Levin said the majority of hate crimes remain unreported, some due to the controversy over immigration.  Were worried that with the increase in attention paid to immigration issues, many victims will be hesitant to report hate crimes for fear of deportation, he said.  While Los Angeles had three straight years of rising hate crime, the nation has not seen consecutive increases since 2004.  City News Service",0,8,5

The announcement comes after a wave of threats to Jewish centers across New York City, most recently at the offices for a senior center in Flatbush.  Threats have also been made toward the Jewish Childrens Museum and the Anti-Defamation Leagues Manhattan headquarters.  The Statue of Liberty holds the torch high in New Yorks Harbor, an eternal reminder that our state will always be the beacon for tolerance and acceptance, said Cuomo, whose quote came first in the press release from the governors office.  We have zero tolerance for intolerance, and I encourage all New Yorkers to report any instance of hate, bias or discrimination. We will continue to aggressively work with our federal and local partners to hold those responsible accountable to the fullest extent of the law, keep our communities safe, and uphold our core values of diversity and inclusion.    The release said that alleged hate crimes have more than doubled so far this year compared to the same time last year.  The $20,000 reward is an increase from the standard $5,000 the state offers for such information.  The recent spate of threats against our Jewish community are threats against all of us. Those directed at children are particularly disturbing. As New Yorkers, we stand united in the face of cowardly tactics designed to frighten, disrupt and divide us, de Blasio said, in a quote that was placed above the governor in his his own offices press release.  Im proud to join forces with the governor as we work with our local, state and federal partners in law enforcement to see that the perpetrators are swiftly brought to justice. The NYPD is the finest police force in the world and I have no doubt those responsible for these incidents will not be able to hide in the shadows for long.    Anyone who has information about hate crimes can call New York States toll-free hotline at (888) 392-3644 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday – Friday or text HATE to 81336. New Yorkers may also call the NYPD Crime Stoppers at 1-800-577-TIPS.    Images: Bill de Blasio via Kevin Case, Flickr, used under Creative Commons; Andrew Cuomo via MTA",1,0,3
113,"Torrey Twane McNabb raised his middle fingers as he was put to death Thursday night for the killing of a cop. McNabbs attorneys had unsuccessfully sought to stop the execution since he was one of several inmates in an ongoing lawsuit challenging the humaneness of the states lethal injection procedure. Before he was put to death, he cursed the state and said: I hate you. McNabb was convicted of killing Montgomery police officer Anderson Gordon in 1997. He shot Gordon five times as the officer sat in his patrol car after arriving at a traffic accident McNabb caused while fleeing a bail bondsman, prosecutors said. Watch: Man Executed For Killing Alabama Police Officer Gordons relatives said in a statement that the 30-year-old officer — known as Brother — was devoted to his family, his two children and his work as a police officer. Over 20 years ago, we lost a companion, a father, a brother and friend who only wanted to make a difference in his community, the statement read. Although, the wounds of having a family member murdered can never be healed, through this tragedy, the Gordon family has remained strong and will continue to be resilient. The inmates in the lawsuit have argued that the sedative midazolam does not reliably render a person unconscious before subsequent drugs stop their lungs and heart. They point to an execution last December during which an Alabama inmate coughed and heaved for the first 13 minutes of the procedure. McNabb appeared to be breathing for the first 20 minutes of the 35-minute long procedure. He later appeared to move his head, grimace and raise his arms after two consciousness checks in which a guard pinches his arm, says his name and pulls back his eyelid — before eventually becoming still. His family members and attorneys who witnessed the execution expressed repeated concerns to each other that he was still conscious during the lethal injection. Hes going to wake up, one of McNabbs family members whispered. He was pronounced dead at 9:38 p.m. CDT, authorities said. Alabama Commissioner Jeff Dunn said he was confident the movements after the second consciousness check were involuntary and that McNabb was not awake. A lawyer for McNabb argued that it would be wrong to carry out the execution while proceedings continue in McNabbs lawsuit. The state argued that the inmates are unlikely to prevail in their claims since the U.S. Supreme Court has allowed other executions, including four in Alabama, to proceed using midazolam. The attorney generals office argued McNabb had presented nothing new to justify a stay. The U.S. Supreme Court delayed the execution for more than two hours to consider McNabbs request for a stay, but ruled that the execution could go forward.

114,"A former Ku Klux Klan leader in Ozark was sentenced Thursday to a decade in prison for sexually abusing a woman in southern Alabama — the maximum sentenced he couldve received. The Dale County circuit judge also fined Steven Joshua Dinkle $1,000, according to a court order signed Thursday. Jurors found Dinkle, 31, guilty of sexual abuse in June. Prosecutors said he recorded himself sexually assaulting an incapacitated woman. The victim asked for a tough sentence for Dinkle in a letter filed this week.

Harrison said he was unaware of Dinkles involvement with the KKK. Dinkle once was the exalted cyclops of the Ozark branch of the International Keystone Knights, a KKK group based in Arkansas, federal authorities said. His mother was the chapter secretary, according to the Justice Department. Dinkle was indicted in 2013 on charges he helped burn a large cross four years earlier near a predominantly black neighborhood in Ozark, located about 85 miles southeast of Montgomery. He pleaded guilty to hate crime and obstruction charges. Dinkles mother, Pamela Morris, pleaded guilty in 2014 after being accused of lying to grand jurors about her involvement in the Klan, court documents show. Sentenced to two years in prison, Dinkle was released on probation and later charged with being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm. He pleaded guilty to illegally possessing a pistol in April 2016. The state sentence will run along with a 15-month federal term that Dinkle already is serving on the gun charge, records show.

116,"Football player Richard Incognito was arrested in Scottsdale for threatening to shoot funeral home employees, police said. According to police, authorities responded to Messinger Pinnacle Peak Mortuary in Scottsdale Monday afternoon for a disorderly conduct call. Police said Incognito, 35, was at the mortuary home regarding funeral arrangements for his father. Incognito reportedly was upset with staff and began to damage property inside the business and shout at employees, police said in a statement. Police allege that at several points while talking to staff, Incognito threatened to retrieve guns from his car to shoot the employees, the statement said. Incognito was arrested and held on misdemeanor charges of threats and disorderly conduct. Incognito most recently played for the Buffalo Bills and is currently a free agent. While he played for the Miami Dolphins, Incognito, along with two other players, was accused of harassing fellow teammate, Jonathan Martin, according to an investigation by the NFL. A report published by the NFL in 2014 said Martin was subjected to persistent harassing language and he told investigators he was most offended by persistent vulgar references about his mother and his sister. The report also said that Incognito subjected Martin to racial insults. For the most part, Incognito does not dispute saying or writing any of the statements that Martin claimed offended him, the report said. Further, Incognito admitted that at times the very purpose of the verbal taunts was to get under the skin of another person. Mugshot via Scottsdale Police",1,2,3

119,"Former Phoenix-area Sheriff Joe Arpaio was convicted in federal court last month of misdemeanor contempt of court, but his attorneys are seeking a new trial, and President Donald Trump is mulling over whether to simply pardon him. A federal judge ruled in 2013 that Arpaios officers racially profiled Latinos. The sheriff refused to halt his immigration patrols, leading to the criminal contempt of court case and him being voted out of office last year. Arpaios attorneys filed two motions Monday in Phoenix federal court seeking a judgment of acquittal and to vacate the verdict for a new trial. The motions are not appeals. (For more information on this and other Phoenix stories, subscribe to Patch to receive daily newsletters and breaking news alerts. If you have an iPhone, click here to get the free Patch iPhone app.) Watch: President Trump Says He Might Pardon Former Arizona Sheriff Trump told Fox News during an interview Sunday that he was seriously considering issuing a pardon within the next few days. While welcome news for Arpaio, immigrant rights activists and others were outraged, saying it amounts to support for racism on the same day that Trump disavowed white nationalists whose rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, turned violent this weekend, leaving one woman dead. Arpaio said Monday that he learned of the presidents comments in the morning and was glad he stood by him. I didnt ask for it, but if hes going to offer, I will accept, because Im not guilty. So appreciate his interest in my matter here in Phoenix, Arpaio said. Were filing these motions because there was absolutely no evidence in support of the judges verdict, the verdict was contrary to the evidence provided in court, and the verdict is a gross miscarriage of justice, said Mark Goldman, a lawyer for Arpaio. Trump on Sunday told Fox that Arpaio is a great American patriot and said he hates to see what has happened to him, according to the news report. He cited his long service in law enforcement and said many Arizona citizens respected his approach to crime. The two have been allies for the past couple of years. Arpaio campaigned for Trump at rallies in Iowa, Nevada and Arizona, and he gave a speech at the Republican National Convention in which he said Trump would prevent immigrants from coming into the country illegally. Trump has also invoked the former sheriff in his calls for tougher immigration enforcement and has advocated for tactics that made Arpaio a national figure. Ive been with him from day one, Arpaio said. On Monday, the president condemned hate groups and said racism is evil in a statement that was much more forceful than hed made earlier after the weekend clashes in Virginia that left one woman dead after a car plowed into a group of counter-protesters who opposed a rally by white nationalists. The white nationalists were protesting a plan to remove a statute of Confederate Gen Robert E. Lee from a Charlottesville park. Those who spread violence in the name of bigotry strike at the very core of America, he said. Cecillia Wang, deputy legal director for the ACLU, criticized the idea that Trump could pardon Arpaio, saying the former sheriff had violated court orders that prohibited illegal detention of Latinos. Make no mistake: This would be an official presidential endorsement of racism, Wang said. Thomas A. Saenz, president and general counsel of MALDEF, or the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said in statement that Trumps comments to Fox were hypocritical and demonstrate how inextricably conflicted he is about condemning racism and the targeting of racial minorities That the White House chose to praise such unconstitutional, discriminatory behavior in defiance of a federal judge on the same day that it refused to condemn the actions of white supremacists in Charlottesville compounds the damage of Trumps appalling moral relativism, Saenz said. In politics, there is hypocrisy on many sides, but the White Houses praise of Arpaio as it tries to extricate itself from equivocal statements about the clear domestic hate-based terrorism in Charlottesville will forever stand out as record-breaking, political disingenuousness.

120,"Other killers snuffed out far more lives than Charles Manson did in 1969. Yet he has endured for nearly a half century as the personification of evil, even in an age in which mass shootings leave dozens dead at a time. Manson, the hippie cult leader who died Sunday at 83, horrified America more than a generation ago with the way he seemed to have turned young people murderously against everything their parents cherished. That horror continued long after he had been locked up, in large part because of the demonic image that crime experts say he cultivated with his bizarre behavior and his searing, wild-eyed gaze. He had that maniacal look that was always so striking, said James Alan Fox, a criminology professor at Northeastern University in Boston, calling Manson the most notorious killer of all time. Manson was memorable: his voice, his appearance, his mannerisms, as well as his crimes and the crazy Charlie act he put on. Manson was convicted of orchestrating the slaughter of pregnant actress Sharon Tate and six other people over two successive August nights in Los Angeles. Prosecutors said he was trying to foment a race war, an idea he supposedly got from a misreading of the Beatles song Helter Skelter. He was sentenced to death, but that was commuted to life in prison after the California Supreme Court struck down the death penalty in 1972. The murders were horrific in their brutality. Tate, a beautiful 26-year-old actress known for Valley of the Dolls, was stabbed and hung from a rafter in her living room. The intruders scrawled Pigs and a misspelled Healter Skelter in the victims blood. To his long rap sheet, historians might add this: accessory to the murder of the 1960s. The Manson familys crimes, along with the deadly violence that erupted later in 1969 during a Rolling Stones concert at Californias Altamont Speedway, seemed to mark the demise of the hippie ideal of peace and love. Mansons notoriety developed in part because he played an integral role ending the mood of wishfulness and illusion that marked that era, said Todd Gitlin, author of The Sixties: Years of Hope, Days of Rage. Although Manson wasnt typical of the counterculture, he could be seen as the poster child for violence that some associated with the anti-establishment movement. Gitlin said he and others in the underground press were as aghast at the crimes as those in the so-called silent majority, which President Richard Nixon had dubbed the older generation. The country was deeply divided, Gitlin said. One of the things that deeply divided it was culture. So Manson was a gift to those Americans who felt that once you escaped from button-down America, you were prone to become a dangerous sicko. Although Manson didnt carry out the murders himself, he has managed to endure in the annals of American crime as the cult leader who persuaded middle-class kids to kill for him. Manson was a manipulator. In a sense, he was a puppeteer, said Jeff Guinn, author of Manson: The Life and Times of Charles Manson. Manson would seem to be all kinds of things to all kinds of people, but nearly all of it was an act. Had Manson been executed, he might barely be remembered today, Guinn said. Instead, with a healthy assist from news coverage, he was able to capture the publics attention every few years when he got a parole hearing or in the occasional interviews he granted, in which he often put on his crazy Charlie act, crime experts said. With the swastika he carved in his forehead plainly visible, Manson crossed his eyes to make funny faces, shouted theatrically and occasionally uttered gibberish. While he spoke earnestly about a troubled childhood and professed his innocence, he also made grandiose and odd remarks. He claimed in an interview that he created God and said they were best friends. He also said if he started murdering people, no one would be left but then, cryptically, said that his children were coming. When ABCs Diane Sawyer asked if the world would forget him, he said, Forget, forgot, forget, forgot and then muttered nonsense.

121,"A white former training officer for the late black ex-LAPD Officer Christopher Dorner is suing the city, alleging she is being made a scapegoat because of the racial connotations attached to the claims of the rogue lawman, who killed himself in a 2013 standoff with police. Sgt. Teresa Evans filed the lawsuit Friday in Los Angeles Superior Court. The complaint alleges racial harassment creating a hostile work environment, discrimination and retaliation. The suit seeks unspecified damages. An LAPD spokesman declined to comment on the suit today. Dorner, who lived with his mother in La Palma in Orange County, promised warfare on LAPD officers and their families for what he believed was his unjustified termination. The 33-year-old Navy reserve officer killed four people during his nearly one-week run from authorities, including the daughter of an LAPD captain and her fiance. He died a few days later from a self-inflicted gunshot wound during a February 2013 confrontation with authorities at a cabin in the unincorporated San Bernardino Mountains community of Angelus Oaks. Dorner reported Evans to LAPD supervisors for allegedly kicking a suspect three times in 2007. In 2009, the LAPD found in favor of Evans. Dorner was charged with making false statements against a fellow officer. The LAPD decided to fire Dorner in September 2008 for lying about the incident and he was formally terminated in February 2009. Before his death, Dorner wrote an online manifesto on his Facebook page, threatening to harm police officials and their families. Part of what Dorner wrote dealt with his accusations of alleged excessive force by Evans. Evans lawsuit maintains she was harassed by LAPD supervisors due to the racial tension sparked by Dorner and because of her complaints that she was being discriminated against because of her race. The suit states she was denied overtime and transferred from a prestigious assignment to one with less stature. Evans ability to earn a promotion was completely destroyed in the aftermath of Dorners claims, the suit alleges. Because (Evans) was a Caucasian, she was subjected to adverse employment actions by the department as a result of the allegations made against her by Dorner, who was black, the suit states. This despite the fact that he was terminated for his own misconduct which had no connection to plaintiff. The LAPD knew about past misconduct by Dorner while working for the department, the suit states. The officer accidentally shot himself in the hand, assaulted a classmate during LAPD training, lied about being in military combat and failed the departments psychological exam, the suit alleges. -City News Service; Christopher Dorner via LAPD",1,0,3
122,"The Los Angeles Police Department already collects data on police stops that is required under a newly signed state law aimed at curbing racial bias among law enforcement agencies, police Chief Charlie Beck said Monday. Los Angeles has been collecting stop data which is very similar to what is in the new Assembly bill for the past dozen years, he said, adding that the department last year recorded such data for about 800,000 stops. Beck said the city may need to make changes to its data collection in order to achieve all of the data points that the state wants, but were way, way ahead on this. The LAPD was required to begin collecting data on people stopped by police more than a decade ago as part of a federally mandated consent decree put in place amid investigations into excessive force. Gov. Jerry Brown signed a bill this weekend that requires law enforcement agencies to record the perceived race or ethnicity of people they stop, the reason for the stop and the result of the encounter, such as whether any arrests were made. The bill was championed by groups calling for better information for evaluating potential racial bias of police officers, and to curb police shootings of unarmed black men. But the bill has also received criticism from police groups, which contend the law creates another layer of bureaucracy and adds menial tasks to the already busy schedules of police officers. Beck said the data collection can be done, but the information gathered should be used properly. If the data is used correctly and examined in the right context, it will be helpful to law enforcement, he said. He said the data about the race or ethnicity of those stopped by police should not be compared to the overall population. Instead, victimization rates, reported suspect identity rates, unemployment rates, housing rates and other broader context issues also should be considered. There are a lot of areas of our society that have disparate impact on races, and I think its important we view these things in those contexts, and hopefully that is the way the state will look at those kinds of things, he said. Beck also said Los Angeles will now be able to determine how its statistics measure up to those of other agencies around the state, so thats significant. -City News Service",0,8,5
123,"The Los Angeles County Commission on Human Relations says there were 389 hate crimes reported in Los Angeles County last year -- a 1 percent increase over 2014 following six years of declines. The slight uptick came as the number of hate crimes statewide decreased nearly 10 percent last year, the Los Angeles Times reported. But the good news for Los Angeles County is that the number of hate crimes reported in 2014 was the second-lowest total in 25 years; the lowest number was in 2013, with 384. Most hate crimes are never reported, according to the commission. As in the past, four groups were overwhelmingly affected by hate crimes: African Americans, gays and lesbians, Jews and Latinos. Those groups represented 86 percent of hate crimes, according to The Times. Race was the primary motivating factor (51 percent), followed by sexual orientation (28 percent) and religion (19 percent). The number of hate crimes motivated by sexual orientation rose 14 percent to 108 last year, with crimes targeting gay men rising 31 percent, The Times reported. The rate of violent crimes based on sexual orientation grew to 81 percent from 71 percent -- the highest rate of violence since 2003. Christopher Argyros, program manager for the Los Angeles LGBT Centers Anti-Violence Project, told The Times that violence against LGBT people persists despite increases in public acceptance. We continue to have a steady stream of hate crime survivors seek services and support, Argyros said, adding there were 15 hate crimes against transgender people last year, compared to 19 the year before, and that all 15 were against transgender women, and all but one were violent.

125,"A smartphone app that residents can use to make video recordings of interactions between police officers and members of the public was released today by the American Civil Liberties Union of California. Videos recorded using the Mobile Justice CA cellphone app can be sent to a local ACLU office as a way to report possible civil rights violations by police officers. The app also can be used to send alerts to others to go to a location to document an incident. A report detailing the event can be sent to ACLU using the app. The concerns over police practices, including racial profiling and excessive use of force, are very real for communities across the state, ACLU of Southern California Executive Director Hector Villagra said. This app will help serve as a check on abuse -- whether by police officers, sheriffs deputies, border patrol, or other officials -- allowing ordinary citizens to record and document any interaction with law enforcement, he said. The app was released the same week Los Angeles police Chief Charlie Beck said he would not release body camera footage in most cases, including major police shooting incidences, and after the Los Angeles Police Commission approved body camera use policies that do not discuss public access to the footage.

126,"By FRED SHUSTER City News Service Reported hate crimes in Los Angeles County declined by 17 percent in 2013 from the previous year, marking the lowest total in 24 years, the county Commission on Human Relations announced today. According to its annual report -- which defines a hate crime as one in which hatred or prejudice toward a victims race or ethnicity, religion, disability, gender or sexual orientation was a substantial factor -- there were 384 reported hate crimes countywide last year, a decrease of 78 from 2012. The continued decline in the number of hate crimes should not lull us into complacency, commission President Susanne Cumming said. We know that the under-reporting of hate crimes remains a serious problem. Although the statistics are encouraging, we have to remember that fear, shame and unfamiliarity with the law prevent many victims from reporting hate crimes. Similar to past years, four groups represented the bulk of victims of hate crimes, with 82 percent of them being either black, lesbian women/gay men, Jewish or Latino. However, two groups documented in the report saw dramatic decreases: crimes targeting gay men dropped 41 percent from 119 to 70, and anti- Jewish crimes declined 48 percent from 81 in 2012 to 42 last year. Were gratified that in 2013, the number of hate crimes in L.A. County was about half of what was reported six years ago, and theres a strong downward trend of youth involvement in hate crimes, said commission Executive Director Robin Toma. However, on average more than one hate crime was reported every day in 2013, and not every group saw a decline in hate crimes. Well be focusing on those crimes, particularly the continued high rate of violence in anti-transgender hate crimes, victimization of African-Americans by gang members, and continuing human relations leadership development with our youth. The report showed that juveniles are showing up less and less as hate crime suspects, becoming the smallest age group for the first time in at least the past 10 years. People under 18 went from being the largest age group among hate crime suspects -- 40 percent in 2006 -- to being the smallest at 14 percent in 2013. Further, the most serious criminal offenses also declined. For the first time in 10 years, there were no murders or attempted murders. Aggravated assaults -- which include assaults with deadly weapons and physical attacks causing greater bodily injury -- decreased 38 percent. I attribute the continued decrease of hate crimes to a strong working relationship between law enforcement, educators and a broad array of dedicated community-based organizations throughout L.A. County, Sheriff John L. Scott said. Collectively, we have made hate crime prevention efforts a priority and we are seeing the results of this work. Although reports of hate crimes against most targeted groups declined, there were some groups which saw increases in 2013 compared to the previous year. Crimes against lesbians increased from 11 in 2012 to 25 last year, transgender people went from 13 to 19, Asian/Pacific Islanders were targeted 15 times last year, an increase of 3 from the previous year, Protestants increased from 4 to 8, and Middle Easterners rose from 4 to 5. Hate crimes with anti- immigrant slurs did not see a decline, remaining at 15. The highest rate of hate crimes took place in the San Fernando Valley. When accounting for population, the Antelope Valley had the highest rate of hate crimes, followed by the metro region, which stretches from West Hollywood to Boyle Heights. The commissions report was generated from data collected from sheriff and city police departments, school districts and community groups. PHOTO Patch file photo.

127,"However, for the first time in three years, California fell from first to second in the nation in the number of anti-Semitic incidents, with 185 reported cases.  Only the State of New York had more reported incidents. Nationally, the number of anti-Semitic incidents declined by 14 percent in 2012. We are pleased to see a decline in anti-Semitic incidents around the country and happy to relinquish Californias standing as the State with the most overall incidents said Amanda Susskind, ADL Pacific Southwest regional director. Many vandalism incidents included swastikas, a Nazi hate symbol. One highly publicized anti-Jewish vandalism crime in 2012 took place when a mother drove her 14-year old daughter and her daughters two friends, ages 13 and 14, to the Northridge home of one of their classmates.  The home belongs to a Holocaust survivors family.  The three juveniles threw toilet paper into the trees and onto the property, wrote the word Jew and drew two big swastikas in maple syrup on the victims walkway, and smeared feces on the homeowners vehicles. The mother later pleaded guilty to several criminal charges and was ordered to complete community service, and the girls were ordered by a juvenile court to complete community service.

128,"The deputy who arrested Mel Gibson on suspicion of drunk driving in 2006 has filed a lawsuit against the Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department, alleging that he was humiliated and passed over for promotion after he refused to remove the anti-Semitic remarks Gibson made from an arrest report. In the lawsuit filed Aug. 31, James Mee, 55, is seeking undisclosed damages for loss of income, benefits, medical expenses and for emotional distress and mental suffering. According to the lawsuit, when Mee, who is Jewish, submitted his report of the arrest he was asked to remove the slurs Gibson made about Jews and instead write a supplemental report including the actors remarks that was to be marked confidential and not made immediately available to the public. The lawsuit alleges that this concession was made for Gibson because he was a close friend of Sheriff Lee Baca, and had close associations with the top administration personnel of the LASD. Mee initially protested, but eventually wrote the supplemental report. However, four pages from the initial arrest report containing an account of the anti-Semitic slurs were published after being leaked to entertainment website TMZ. Mee says he was not the source of this leak and that the department didnt find evidence of his guilt. Yet, he contends, he was not awarded promotions to a traffic investigator or motorcycle deputy position because of discrimination. You go to work and you dont know what to expect, Mee told the Los Angeles Times. Im constantly in fear. Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the sheriffs department, denied the allegations. We look forward to telling the whole story and were not even close to that, not by any stretch of the imagination, Whitmore said. It has nothing to do with ethnicity or religious beliefs, he said. The sheriffs department launched an investigation into the individual who was releasing confidential government documents to the public without authorization, and that is a crime. In August 2006, Mee was accused of, investigated for and interrogated by the Internal Affairs Bureau regarding the leakage of the arrest report, despite the fact that several others had access to the report, his lawsuit alleges. The department intentionally took about four years to complete the investigation, and the delay affected Mees ability to be promoted, according to the suit. He was involuntarily transferred from the Malibu/Lost Hills Station to the Agoura patrol area and received a negative performance report, which interfered with his promotion, he said. In September of 2006, he was served with a search warrant for his bank accounts and home, and his personal computer was removed. However, no incriminating evidence was found against him, the suit said.",1,0,3

132,"Longshoremen at one of the Port of Oaklands four active marine terminals have returned to work after walking off the job Thursday morning in response to nooses that were found on the property in recent weeks, port officials said. The walkout by longshoremen at the Oakland International Container Terminal, which is operated by SSA Marine at 1717 Middle Harbor Road, meant that the terminal had to suspend its operations but it has resumed operations Thursday afternoon, port spokesman Mike Zampa said. The Port of Oakland was informed that a symbol associated with racial bigotry was discovered on the terminal property, Zampa said in a statement. The Port of Oakland does not tolerate bigotry or discrimination of any kind. That is explicit in our policies and in our day-to-day operations. Referring to SSA Marine, Zampa said, Weve been in close contact with the terminal operator. They are investigating the incident and taking steps to prevent a reoccurrence. Theyll apprise us of those next steps. Robert McEllrath, president of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, said in a statement, The display of hangmens nooses for the second time in two weeks at the worksite are inexcusable and expressly prohibited conduct under the terms of the collective bargaining unit. The union is committed to securing a non-discriminatory work environment for all individuals working at the ports, McEllrath said. He said, We reject in the strongest possible terms racism in all its forms and this matter is being vigorously investigated.

133,"Sobbing echoed through an often pin-drop silent auditorium as the many children of a slain Richmond police officer spoke of his traits during a memorial Friday. Those children were joined by elected officials at Richmond Memorial Auditorium in describing the spirit of Augustine Gus Vegas, a 58-year-old Vallejo man fatally shot while off-duty on Feb. 11. And several hundred people, throngs of uniformed personnel from cities across the Bay Area as well as mayors and other prominent officials, were part of the turnout for the memorial. Interim Richmond police Chief Allwyn Brown and the citys mayor, Tom Butt, were among the first to speak; both highlighted Vegass embodiment of the community policing that the city has strived to embrace. And as an officer, Brown said Vegass approach to the job could be summarized as peacemaking. Peacemaking, simply put, is a way of living and acting that emphasizes mercy and compassion, Brown said. Still, Brown said Vegas accepted the many faces of danger that police officers come to learn. But such danger is never expected to be lurking in the walls of your personal sanctuary, he said. Vegas was allegedly killed in his home at 35 Narragansett Court by 30-year-old Robert Vega, the father of Vegass 6-year-old grandson. Vega was arrested by Fairfield police the same day and charged on Wednesday with murder and the kidnapping of that boy by the Solano County District Attorneys Office. Butt said this murder robbed the city of a a dedicated public servant ... who had a commitment to the health and welfare of his entire community. Vegas was involved in a Vallejo nonprofit founded by his wife, Sandra. The organization, Foster Greatness, provides services for foster children. Along with his wife, Vegas was a deeply religious individual. His faith was cited as the reason he became a family man and made a late in life turn to the law enforcement profession. After graduating from Napa Valley Colleges Criminal Justice Training Center in 1990, Vegass son Joe recalled how his father had door after door slammed in his face. In 2001, the Richmond Police Department gave him a chance, he said. They saw in him what we saw in him. Vegas went on to serve in the departments regulatory, property crimes and homicide units. And in his full-time job of raising 10 children, he was portrayed as an ideal father. It takes a special man to have (that many) kids and make each one feel like the center of his world, Joe Vegas said. Enrico Rico Maldonado, Vegass second-oldest son, remembered how his father treated him like a champion even when he failed to make it past tryouts for football year after year. He told me that if he was making a team, Id be his No. 1 player, he said. He never neglected to tell us how proud of us he was. Other children shared anecdotes that similarly spoke to the unconditional love Vegas offered throughout his life. Vegass daughter Angel, who reportedly had a relationship with the alleged murderer, said her father died fulfilling a mission to protect and serve. He protected me, Angel said, tear-stricken and flanked by her brothers and sisters on auditoriums stage. He protected my baby. Vallejo Mayor Osby Davis, a friend of Vegass, recognized the importance of this. What better eulogy than to die as he lived -- saving and protecting his family, Davis said. --Bay City News/Image via The Richmond Police Department on Facebook",0,8,5
134,"One Goh, the man accused of killing seven people and injured three others at an Oakland university in 2012, wants to die. Both prosecutors and defense attorneys agreed today at the beginning of a hearing to determine his competency to stand trial for the April 2, 2012, shooting at Oikos University that Goh wants the death penalty. But they disagreed on whether Goh reasonably feels guilty for his crime and simply wants his punishment or if he suffers from persistent delusions that prevent him from understanding the criminal proceedings against him. The competency hearing is expected to take about two weeks. If found competent, Goh will stand trial for seven counts of murder and three counts of attempted murder. If found to be still incompetent, a three-year deadline to restore competency would lapse and Goh would spend the rest of his life in a psychiatric treatment facility. Goh, a former student at Oikos, already admitted to Oakland police that he entered the school that morning and opened fire, killing six students and a staff member. The Korean Christian school near Oakland International Airport was founded in 2004. Before todays hearing, Goh sat leaning forward in his red jail jumpsuit, his hands shackled, attentively listening to Assistant Public Defender David Klaus and nodding. He glanced around the courtroom, his eyes alert behind his thick-rimmed glasses. But later he looked straight down, grimacing and breathing heavily. Criminal proceedings were suspended against Goh in October 2012 and he was moved from Santa Rita Jail to Napa State Hospital. Nearly every psychiatrists report since then has found him incapable of understanding the proceedings against him and assisting in his defense. But after a judge allowed doctors to involuntarily treat Goh with psychotropic medication in February, a July report by Napa State Hospital forensic psychologist Todd Schirmer found him competent to stand trial, leading to todays proceedings. Deputy Public Defender Patrick Jensen today called that report an outlier. Jensen said Goh continues to believe he can read peoples minds, that he was covered in a silver foam that communicates with him and that people at the jail and hospital are putting Windex in his food. He also believes that Oikos administrators were engaged in a conspiracy against him, having school security follow him and putting a camera in his fathers house where he was living so he had to move out and ended up homeless, according to Jensen. Mr. Goh continues to believe these things, Jensen said. Mr. Goh hallucinates, Mr. Goh talks to himself, Mr. Goh hears voices. He is delusional and suffers from paranoid schizophrenia but still does not believe, after three years of hospitalization, that he has any mental health issues, Jensen said. To bolster their case, Gohs attorneys had Jessica Ferranti, a professor of psychiatry at the University of California at Davis who examined Goh in 2012 and 2013, re-examine him this year. Ferranti said that in her early examinations, Goh told her he believes he was involved in a spiritual war and was persecuted by most people he met, isolating him and making him unable to cope with most interactions with other people. He told her then that he had seen an evil man in the mirror that wasnt him, a vision that was linked to the religious war he was fighting. According to Ferranti, he told her this year that he had seen the same man in the mirror again. Deputy District Attorney Stacie Pettigrew said that Goh is unwilling to assist in his defense, but that doesnt mean he is incompetent to stand trial. Instead, he is so wracked with guilt and remorse that he wants to die to erase the memory of the gruesome shooting he committed that day and to avoid putting his family through any more pain and shame. The defendants desire for the death penalty does not equal incompetence, Pettigrew said. He doesnt want to assist counsel because this counsel is standing in the way of the ultimate punishment. Members of Gohs treatment team and other psychiatric experts will testify during the hearing, expected to end with a ruling by Judge Gloria Rhynes on Dec. 15. --Bay City News",0,8,5

139,"Newly released data from the Berkeley Police Department shows significant racial disparities in who is pulled over by police and targeted for searches, local civil rights leaders announced Tuesday morning. The records of traffic stops this year show that not only are black people stopped by police at a higher rate than white people, but the majority of black people pulled over were let go without any arrest or citation. While police stopping black people more frequently is troubling, whats far, far worse is that when theyre stopped its much more often for no reason, civil rights attorney Jim Chanin said. The data was released through a public records request earlier this month and revealed at a news conference Tuesday called by a coalition of civil rights and police watchdog groups. The records show that between January and August black people have been pulled over at a rate far exceeding their proportion of the citys population. Berkeleys declining black population was only 10 percent of the city in 2010, but since January black people have accounted for 30.5 percent of those stopped by police. White people, who make up about 60 percent of Berkeleys population, were only 36.7 percent of those stopped by police. Of those who were stopped, 38.1 percent of white people were eventually released without being arrested or cited, but 66.2 percent of black people were released without being cited. Chanin said this clearly indicates black people were frequently stopped for no reason. Collection of the data has been mandatory since last year after the city adopted the Fair and Impartial Policing Policy. The policy requires police to collect stop data for both vehicles and pedestrians, including the race, gender and age of the person stopped as well as the reason for the stop and whether any search was conducted. It took until January to get the data collection up and running. The data released so far includes traffic stops between January and August but not pedestrian or bicycle stops as mandated by the city policy. Of the 5,215 stops recorded, only 4,658 of the records contain racial data. None of the records contain location information. Berkeley police spokeswoman Officer Jennifer Coats said omitting the pedestrian data was a mistake on the part of the department and that data would be provided. Marcel Jones, a member of the University of California at Berkeleys Black Student Union and Berkeley Copwatch, said the data shows a pattern inefficient and ineffective policing that is creating and maintaining trauma within the black community. National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Berkeley chapter president Mansour Id-Deen said the data showed illegal practices by Berkeley police, patterns that people of color have long complained about, are being confirmed. Berkeley police Chief Michael Meehan said in a statement today that it is difficult to draw conclusions from such a small sampling of data but the department is years ahead in training to prevent racial profiling. The men and women of the Berkeley Police Department do not, have not and will never tolerate discriminatory, bias-based policing. Such discrimination is illegal, it is not our practice and it is not part of our organizational culture, Meehan said. Few agencies have done as much as the Berkeley Police Department to understand and address this issue, he said. But Chanin pointed to neighboring Oakland as an example of how the analysis of this kind of data can lead a police department to successfully grapple with reducing racial disparity in stops. After a lot of encouraging and badgering in Oakland the department is reducing the number of stops where people are released with no arrest or citation, Chanin said. Oakland is continuing its analysis of racial stop data with the help of Stanford professor Jennifer Eberhardt. The analysis is required by a federal judge overseeing a series of reforms agreed to in the settlement of a lawsuit brought by Chanin and John Burris. But while he, Burris and police Chief Sean Whent have been working diligently on the issue in Oakland, cameras have probably made the biggest difference, Chanin said. Use of force complaints have dropped 40 percent in Oakland since police body cameras have been put into widespread use there, and Berkeley should follow suit, Chanin said. City Councilman Jesse Arreguin, who attended todays news conference and supported efforts to begin tracking stop data in Berkeley, said the City Council has been working on getting body cameras for the department since last year. The department has been working on drafting a policy and buying the cameras. While there isnt an exact timetable for their implementation, Arreguin said he hopes it will happen soon. Arreguin called the numbers released today alarming and said he looks forward to seeing the rest of the data, including pedestrian stops and location information. While the data doesnt show the full picture, this information makes it clear I hope to everyone that theres an issue we have to address, Arreguin said. There are disproportionate numbers of black and brown people who are being stopped by police. Aside from the issue of simple fair treatment, Chanin said today that racial profiling has a fundamental relationship to crime. People stopped and searched for no reason become alienated from the police and are less likely to cooperate with investigations, he said. By Bay City News",0,8,5
140,"A smartphone app that residents can use to make video recordings of interactions between police officers and members of the public was released last week by the American Civil Liberties Union of California. Videos recorded using the Mobile Justice CA cellphone app can be sent to a local ACLU office as a way to report possible civil rights violations by police officers. The app also can be used to send alerts to others to go to a location to document an incident. A report detailing the event can be sent to ACLU using the app. The concerns over police practices, including racial profiling and excessive use of force, are very real for communities across the state, ACLU of Southern California Executive Director Hector Villagra said. This app will help serve as a check on abuse -- whether by police officers, sheriffs deputies, border patrol, or other officials -- allowing ordinary citizens to record and document any interaction with law enforcement, he said. The app was released the same week Los Angeles police Chief Charlie Beck said he would not release body camera footage in most cases, including major police shooting incidences, and after the Los Angeles Police Commission approved body camera use policies that do not discuss public access to the footage. Asked about the ACLU camera app, Beck told City News Service he feels its something that they are well within their rights to do and Im hoping they are willing to share the information with the department. --City News Service --Photo by Mirna Alfonso Also on Patch:",0,8,5
141,"Oakland police are helping to develop a training program on implicit racial bias and procedural justice as part of a California Department of Justice effort to address the current crisis of confidence in law enforcement, California Attorney General Kamala Harris announced Friday. The training program, which is being developed with the Stockton Police Departments and Stanford University Professor Jennifer L. Eberhardt, among others, was one of the actions announced following an internal state Department of Justice review of its existing training on the use of force and implicit bias. It will be certified by the Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training, according to state officials. The 90-day review, conducted by the Department of Justices Division of Law Enforcement, also developed policies on implicit bias and racial profiling and created a 21st Century Policing Working Group to foster further discussion. Speaking at an event in Los Angeles, Harris said she hopes the review can be used as a blueprint for police and sheriffs departments throughout the state to critically examine their existing policies and draft recommendations that are appropriate for the communities they serve. Speakers at the event cited the success of Oaklands Operation Ceasefire, a community-based effort to reduce violence and recidivism, as an example for other communities. As a result of the review, the Department of Justice is adopting bodyworn cameras for all special agents conducting field operations and plans to institute new policies on the technologys use. The department is also planning to train all special agents on fair and impartial policing practices and implicit biases by the end of May, officials said.

142,"By PAUL ANDERSON An Anaheim man accused of helping the Islamic State militant group ate a peanut butter sandwich tonight shortly after a federal judge in Santa Ana urged him to have dinner or he would be ordered to be force- fed, his attorney said. Muhanad Elfatih M.A. Badawi also ate two ounces of tuna, honey and drank some apple juice, a meal he typically enjoys at home, his attorney Kate Corrigan said. Badawi was ordered brought back to court at noon Monday to ensure he continues eating, and if he doesnt he will be force fed. Badawi has sustained significant weight loss while in custody. U.S. District Judge David O. Carter said he was contacted Nov. 20 with news that the 24-year-old Badawi was refusing to eat or be treated by female medical personnel while in custody in the Santa Ana jail. Carter, working with detention and medical officials and Corrigan worked to have Badawi transferred to the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles where he indicated he would eat. Badawis weight dropped from about 140 pounds to about 110 in recent days. The gaunt man appeared lethargic at times during the hearing and Carter had to sharply command his attention occasionally. At one point during his detention in Los Angeles Badawi allowed officials to intravenously feed him, but then quickly pulled the needle out, and another time he allowed more fluids. A nurse at the Santa Ana jail told Carter that Badawi was reluctant to receive any treatment from her, but was more cooperative with a male nurse. A psychologist who has been treating him said her staff is almost entirely female and when he first arrived in Santa Anas jail he was somewhat resistant. Badawi told the psychologists and social workers he would only speak with females when necessary, the psychologist Lisa Hope said. The psychologist added that he cited his religious beliefs for his reluctance to deal with women counselors. Badawi, who insisted in todays hearing he was not on a hunger strike, also indicated he wanted to fast on Mondays and Thursday for religious reasons. Carter, who has spent a good deal of time in Middle Eastern countries such as Afghanistan where he trains officials on legal issues, scoffed at the suggestion that Badawi had a legitimate reason to fast on those days. Youve got the wrong days and the wrong time, Carter told the defendant. This is not Friday and this is not Ramadan, the Muslim holy month, marked by daily fasting from dawn to sunset. Badawi interjected, The Prophet Muhammad would fast on Mondays and Thursdays. Carter noted that Friday was a typical Sabbath day for Muslims and that fasting was not required. Mr. Badawi, this is going to end today, Carter said before arranging for marshals to fetch food for Badawi so he could eat it this evening. Carter even pulled money out of his own pocket to pay for it, but the marshals said they would foot the bill. Carter told Badawi he once had to issue an order to force feed a reluctant prisoner when he was the presiding judge in Orange County Superior Court and he would do so again if the defendant kept fasting. Carter also told Badawi that he had to let female medical and psychological staff treat him. I hope you dont put this court in a position between choosing between a religious value and a value of equality of sexes because firmly I can tell you if Im put in that position I will take the values of this country in terms of equality and gender and youll be treated by male or female... Do you understand that? Carter asked. Badawi replied, Yes. Corrigan said she has seen a decline in her clients mental state since the terrorist attacks in Paris. She noted that he has had no problem dealing with her and her female staff on the legal team. Badawi was indicted along with Nader Salem Elhuzayel, 25, of Anaheim, on charges of bank fraud and providing material support to IS. The indictment alleges that during April and May, Elhuzayel operated a scheme to rip off three banks by depositing stolen checks into his personal checking accounts and then withdrawing cash from automated teller machines. Badawi is accused of buying a plane ticket for Elhuzayel to get to Turkey. The men, who have been denied bail, were initially charged May 22, a day after FBI agents arrested the two -- Elhuzayel at Los Angeles International Airport and Badawi at an apartment in Anaheim.

143,"Relatives of a 22-year-old man killed in a Laguna Niguel bar fight called on prosecutors today to charge the defendant with a hate crime, but the cases prosecutor said it would make it harder to win a guilty verdict. The family of Shayan Mazroei, who was of Iranian descent, are alleging that there is evidence the dispute started when he was insulted with racial epithets. The defendant -- Craig Matthew Tanber -- is a member of a prominent Orange County white supremacist gang who has a conviction for voluntary manslaughter. Mazroei got into an argument with a female friend of Tanbers just after midnight Sept. 8 at Patsys Irish Pub in Laguna Niguel. Its not clear what sparked the conflict, according to Senior Deputy District Attorney Larry Yellin. It started off as people talking in a bar and it got out of hand, which sometimes happens in bars, Yellin said. However, it quickly devolved with her hurling racial insults at the victim and spitting in his face, Yellin alleged. Mazroei, in turn, spit in her face, Yellin said. Tanber, however, wasnt even present when she did racially insult the victim, Yellin said. And even if it could be proven she relayed everything to Tanber later then the prosecutor would still have to prove the defendant killed Mazroei because of his ethnicity, Yellin said. Its not possible for me to make that connection legally, Yellin said. Convicting Tanber of a hate crime would not make much of a difference in his punishment given that the defendant already faces 76 years to life in prison as a third striker, Yellin said. Its legally insignificant, Yellin said. It seems to matter to them and I understand that, but it doesnt mean that I can prove it. With evidence from eyewitnesses and surveillance video, prosecutors believe they have a strong case for murder, but adding a hate crime to the mix might lead to problems gaining a conviction and pose issues later with appeals, Yellin said. If there was enough evidence to indicate a hate crime occurred, It would still be a foolish idea (to prosecute it) because it wouldnt be a strong case and it would compromise the possibility of a verdict, Yellin said. The victims familys attorney, Neama Rahmani, said at a news conference in Irvine today that his office is continuing to investigate the conflict. What I can say is Tanber is a known white supremacist, Rahmani said. He has gang tattoos, so his thoughts on Iranian-Americans are clear. We are still investigating his comments ... and his motivation, but I think its a fair assumption to say that he and his girlfriend do not hold Iranian-Americans in high esteem and in fact (that) may have been a motivation for the murder. A friend of Tanbers apparently said something rude to the victim, prompting a response from him that angered the defendant, Yellin said. Tanber then allegedly punched and stabbed Mazroei twice in the upper chest area, Yellin said. Tanber was friends with the woman at the center of the conflict, but they did not have a romantic relationship, Yellin said. Tanber was free on parole at the time of the conflict. He had been charged with special circumstances murder in the April 4, 2004 beating death of 26-year-old Cory Lamons in Huntington Beach, but he struck a plea bargain with prosecutors after a mistrial was declared when an alternate juror Googled one of the co-defendants and shared the information with other panelists. Tanber pleaded guilty Feb. 2, 2007 to voluntary manslaughter and admitted sentencing enhancements for doing so to benefit a street gang, according to court records. He also pleaded guilty to dissuading a witness by force, street terrorism and assault with a deadly weapon or force likely to produce great bodily injury. Tanber was sentenced to 13 years in prison. Convicted killer Billy Joe Johnson, the accused ringleader who lured Lamons to where he was beaten, was one of the co-defendants in Tanbers case. Johnson is on death row in San Quentin. He was sentenced to death in November 2009, when he told jurors he wanted to go to San Quentin because he would have better amenities there, such as a television set. If Tanber had been convicted of special circumstances murder he would have been sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Tanber is charged with murder with sentencing enhancements for the personal use of a knife and prior strike convictions for the Lamons killing. He also has prior strike convictions for residential burglary in 2001, and is accused of serving a prison term for one year or more and not remaining free for more than five years.

144,"Hate crimes in Orange County dropped 18 percent in 2014 compared with the prior year, and more than 50 percent from a decade ago, according to the county Human Relations Commissions annual report released today. There were 40 hate crimes reported in Orange County in 2014, a decline from 49 in 2013, according to the commission. There were 99 reported hate crimes in 2004. Overall, violent hate crime was down in the county, but it still represented 57.5 percent of reported hate crimes, with 23, last year. There were 28 violent hate crimes reported in 2013. The top target of hate crimes were black victims, a consistent trend in the county since 1991, officials said. There were 11 reported hate crimes against black people last year, the same as in 2013. Just 2 percent of Orange Countys population is black. There were eight hate crimes against gays and lesbians last year, one more than in 2013. There were six hate crimes directed at Jews last year, up one from 2013. There were three against Arabs or Muslims last year, down from six in 2013, and hate crimes against Latinos and Asians matched 2013 levels at three. Weve been seeing a steady and consistent decline in hate crimes, so its really good news, said Rusty Kennedy, executive director of the commission. He chalked it up to a collaborative effort with law enforcement and community organizations. Weve been reaching 40,000 school kids a year for the last 25 years and I like to think those efforts, which are all oriented around tolerance, have grown up, Kennedy said. I have some people on staff that we had as teenagers. City News Service",0,8,5
145,"A Los Angeles judge sealed a sentencing hearing today for a convicted bank robber who stole the identity of Irvine Co. Chairman Donald Bren and cashed most of a nearly $1.4 million tax refund check made out to the billionaire. Moundir Kamil, 45, who was dubbed the Give Me More Bandit for his part in a series of 2003 bank robberies, acknowledged using Brens personal information to open an account at an East West Bank branch in February 2010 and depositing the check. U.S. District Judge Margaret M. Morrow closed the sentencing hearing to the public and no further information was immediately available from the U.S. Attorneys Office. Bren, the Orange County-based investor who is the majority owner of Manhattans MetLife Building, is worth $15.2 billion, making him the countrys richest real estate investor, according to Forbes. His firm, The Irvine Co., owns 500 office properties, 50,000 apartments and more than 40 shopping centers. Between February and April 2010, Kamil transferred or withdrew about $1.1 million from the phony bank account and transferred it to bank accounts in other names, according to the U.S. Attorneys Office.

146,"By PAUL ANDERSON A half-dozen prosecutors in the Orange County District Attorneys Office deny being encouraged to avoid trying cases before a judge who recently removed the office from handling the penalty trial of the worst mass killer in the countys history. Some defense attorneys have speculated or claimed in at least two published reports that prosecutors were advised to avoid taking cases before Orange County Superior Court Judge Thomas Goethals, who ruled the District Attorneys Office can no longer be fair in the way it handles the case of Scott Dekraai. He pleaded guilty last year to killing his ex-wife and seven other people in and a round a Seal Beach beauty salon on Oct. 12, 2011. Interviews conducted by City News Service with six veteran prosecutors from multiple units in the office, ranging from sex crimes to special investigations, yielded the same response -- that no one has been directed to object to trying a case before Goethals in a legal maneuver known in slang terms as papering a jurist. All of the prosecutors spoke to CNS on condition of anonymity. There is no edict for this office to paper (Goethals), one senior prosecutor said. Its an individual call. That prosecutor willingly brought a high-profile murder case to Goethals without any blowback at all. The Los Angeles Times recently reported that the District Attorneys Office asked to disqualify Goethals in 57 cases since February 2014, which was about the time Public Defender Scott Sanders filed a 505-page motion seeking to have the District Attorneys Office removed from the Dekraai case and the death penalty taken away as an option. In 2011, Goethals was papered three times, according to the newspaper. In 2012, there were no disqualification requests involving the judge, followed by two in 2013, the Times reported. Goethals courtroom clerk said he has refused requests in the past to comment on the issue. The move to disqualify a judge for appearing to be prejudiced can be done without explanation by either side. Many of the prosecutors interviewed by CNS pointed out that during the years that there were only a smattering of disqualification requests filed against Goethals, he was an assignment judge at the Central Justice Center in Santa Ana. There are almost no scenarios in which a prosecutor would paper a judge who is deciding which courtroom to assign for a trial, the prosecutors said. When youre in (Department) C5, no one papers you, one veteran prosecutor said. It could happen if the judge in that courtroom wanted to make a plea deal that prosecutors objected to, the prosecutor said. But otherwise, its unheard of, he said. Goethals has drawn a relatively high number of disqualification requests, but they stem mainly from his perceived stance and past rulings in sex-crime cases, not because of the Dekraai evidentiary hearings, which took months, the prosecutors said. At issue is the civil code 1108, which allows for evidence of uncharged criminal acts. Multiple prosecutors who worked in the sex-crime unit said it was commonly known that Goethals might limit how much evidence a jury could see on their cases. Particularly at issue was the use of 1108 evidence, meaning testimony from victims a defendant has not been charged with attacking because the statute of limitations ran out or due to a prosecutors discretion. Those types of witnesses, prosecutors say, can be useful in establishing a pattern of crimes and countering a defendants claim of a my word against your word defense. Weve been papering him for a long time because of 1108, said one prosecutor. We just knew we would not go to Goethals if we have 1108 evidence in our cases. There was never really any policy, no blanket-paper discussions. We just talked about it among ourselves. Another experienced prosecutor with background in the sex-crimes unit said he tried a case before Goethals without any problems because there were no issues related to 1108 evidence. He did not receive any feedback from his office or supervisors that he shouldnt have taken the case before Goethals, he said. For some prosecutors, objections are filed on a case-by-case basis. There are still people in the gang unit who have gone to him on preliminary hearings and trials, and in terms of blanket-paper that hasnt happened. Its still up to the individual prosecutor as far as Ive seen, another veteran prosecutor said. Goethals most recent ruling, however, may be a tipping point that pushes more prosecutors to avoid the judges court altogether, the prosecutor said. People just feel anything can happen in there, he said. Its definitely concerning. I wouldnt want to try a case in there, another prosecutor said. Were representing our client and if the thought is a particular bench officer isnt going to allow us the freedom to present what we think is admissible evidence or is going to do something harmful to the case, then we have the right to a preemptory challenge, another prosecutor said. Goethals ruling to recuse the District Attorneys Office from the Dekraai case wasnt the first time he has taken on prosecutors. In 2013, Goethals removed Deputy District Attorney Eric Scarbrough from a case mid-trial when defense attorney John Barnett objected to a law enforcement officers delay in turning over a police report to the prosecutor, who was obligated to turn it over to the defense. Deputy District Attorney Nicole Nicholson was brought in to finish off the case, which resulted in the conviction of Jesse Andrew Green, a former Garden Grove police officer who sexually assaulted three women he dated. Greens trial, ironically, included testimony from a fourth victim whom Green was not charged with sexually assaulting because the statute of limitations prevented it. In July 2013, Goethals, the former defense attorney and prosecutor, removed Deputy District Attorney Sandra Nassar from a case after she admitted she withheld potentially exculpatory evidence for strategic reasons. In March of last year, just before the first round of evidentiary hearings were held in the Dekraai case, Goethals removed Deputy District Attorney Erik Petersen from a case because he found that Petersen did not hand over evidence to defense attorneys as required by law. The judge found Petersen made a so-called Brady violation, named after a landmark case where the U.S. Supreme Court held that a defendant is entitled to get any and all evidence that may prove innocence. Brady violations were a sticking point in the Dekraai motions alleging government misconduct involving the use of jail informants and Petersen was named throughout those pleadings and was called to testify.

147,"By PAUL ANDERSON City News Service The number of human trafficking victims in Orange County doubled between 2011 and 2013 as law enforcement officials sought to rout pimps, free prostitutes and break up human smuggling rings, county officials said today. A report on trends in human trafficking was released today to coincide with the unveiling of a Orange County Transportation Authority a bus with wrap- around ad promoting public awareness of the issue. Orange County Supervisor Todd Spitzer, also an OCTA board member, said the agencys buses serve about 1 million passengers weekly, and he hopes more people will come forward with information about human trafficking victims. Eventually, all OCTA buses will carry ads that include phone numbers for reporting crimes, OCTA spokesman Joel Zlotnik said. Bus drivers also are being trained to recognize signs of human trafficking and have onboard radios for contacting law enforcement agencies, he said. OCTA officials hope victims of human trafficking will see the ads and know there is help for them, Zlotnik said. Sheriff Sandra Hutchens said Southern California is one of the top destinations for human traffickers and Orange County has become a prime target. Anaheim police Chief Raul Quezada said that since his city has taken the lead in cracking down on human trafficking, there have been 750 investigations, 90 victims and about 350 arrests. We realize its not just a law enforcement problem, but a community problem, Quezada said. Weve come a long way in our fight against human trafficking, but theres a long way to go. Lita Mercado of Community Service Programs, a nonprofit that provides help for the victims of human trafficking, offered a number of statistics and trends that have been noted over the past few years. For instance, the perpetrators tend to be in their 20s and half the victims were teens or younger, she said. About 65 percent of human trafficking victims are U.S. citizens, Mercado said. Most of the rest come from Mexico, the Philippines, South Korea, China, the United Kingdom, and Vietnam, but investigators are now seeing some victims from Iran, Kenya and North Korea, she added. Not all of the victims come from dysfunctional families or have had difficult childhoods, Mercado said. Even those who have had stable upbringings can be seduced into the lifestyle by smooth-talking pimps, Mercado said. Last year, the nonprofit noted in its report, that 28 women and eight men were victims of labor trafficking, while 177 females, one male and one transgender person were victims of sex trafficking. In 2013, 35 of the victims of labor trafficking were adults and one was a child, 116 of the victims of prostitution were adult and 63 were children, according to the report. Last year, there were 52 human trafficking related arrests and 48 were prosecuted. In 2012, there were 37 arrests and 33 were prosecuted. In 2011, there were 24 human trafficking arrests and all were prosecuted. Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas, who created a unit in his office to prosecute pimps, said Community Service Programs has been integral to the task forces success in cracking down on the crime because it has helped stabilize victims, who can testify against their pimps. There was such a need to work with these victims, Rackauckas said. Its just such an awful problem and CSP has done such a wonderful job... Its one of these areas where you just have to have a collaborative effort... and its also going to require a lot of public awareness. Rackauckas encouraged everyone anyone to alert authorities when they see prostitution. When you see someone who is clearly a sex slave, we need to know about it, Rackauckas said. Prostitutes become so debilitated by their pimps that it is often difficult to help them turn their lives around and trust the authorities, Rackauckas said.",0,8,5

An astute resident helped investigators capture a man suspected of starting a fire that engulfed a historic Victorian home in Pasadena. Dozens were evacuated and two were treated for injuries at the scene when a fire broke out on the 6th floor of a senior living facility. The motive for the killing of man found with multiple gunshot wounds was unknown, and no suspects have been identified, police said. Sheriff Jim McDonnell announced an investigation into secret department gangs revealed by a deputy who admitted to belonging to one. When police arrested a man wanted for rape and murder in New York, he was allegedly holding another woman against her will in Los Angeles. The 22-year-old was arrested just hours after the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Florida that left 49 people and the gunman dead.

150,"Federal immigration agents have returned to Los Angeles County jails to seek out deportable inmates under a new policy by Sheriff Jim McDonnell that has prompted criticism from immigrant advocates who say it could lead to racial profiling, it was reported Wednesday. The new Sheriffs Department policy comes after county lawmakers voted this year to end a controversial program that allowed Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to work inside the jails to assess the immigration status of inmates. Now ICE agents are being allowed back inside, but only to interview inmates who have committed serious crimes and are not protected by the California Trust Act, the Los Angeles Times reported in an article posted on its website. That 2013 law limits when local law enforcement officials can collaborate with federal immigration authorities. Under the new policy, jail officials will also notify ICE up to seven days before those inmates are being released so immigration agents can pick them up and initiate deportation proceedings. The new procedures stand in contrast to those in San Francisco, where lawmakers have banned all sheriff collaboration with immigration officials except when federal authorities have a court order or a warrant. San Franciscos policies have been in a spotlight since the July shooting death of a woman on a busy pier, allegedly by a man in the country illegally who had recently been released from local custody. The incident sparked an outcry. Figures as varied as Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump called for closer collaboration between local police and ICE.  Immigrant advocates, who say such collaboration leads to racial profiling and sows distrust in law enforcement among immigrant communities, say L.A. Countys new policy is a reaction to that pressure, The Times reported. --City News Service To read the full story, please click here:",0,8,5
151,"Photo via Shutterstock A black former warehouse worker for a newsstand chain is suing his ex-employer, claiming he was forced to quit after enduring months of racially related jokes and comments from co-workers and his supervisor. Ahmad Benson filed the lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court against Hudson News, which sells magazines, snacks and drinks at such places as Los Angeles International Airport, which the plaintiff serviced while working at warehouse in Carson from May 20l4 until February. The suit filed Monday alleges harassment, retaliation, failure to prevent discrimination and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Benson is seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. A Hudson News representative did not immediately reply to a request for comment. According to the lawsuit, Bensons supervisor did nothing to stop two co- workers from making racial taunts against him and even uttered some offensive remarks herself. It was common for plaintiffs supervisor to address him as (N---a,) the suit alleges. Shortly after Benson was hired, he says he was questioned about his ownership of a 2009 Mercedes-Benz C300. According to his lawsuit, his supervisor asked him, Are you selling drugs? There is no way a black man can have a car like that if he is not selling drugs. The alleged harassment escalated from comments about his car to Bensons African ethnicity and the fact that he lived for many years in Ghana, his suit alleges. The supervisor asked Benson, When you were in Africa, would you fight over food with the lions because there isnt any food?, according to his lawsuit. He alleges the supervisor also told the other employees, Be careful, Ahmad came from Africa and he might give you Ebola. With his boss present, other Hudson News employees frequently referred to blacks as N---as and said they like eating chicken, cornbread, greens and watermelon, the suit states. Bensons supervisor would laugh and mock Benson instead of becoming upset at the racial remarks, the suit alleges. The boss also chuckled when another Hudson employee called the plaintiff a black Somali pirate, the suit states. A co-worker asked Benson if he ran around bull-naked and lived up a tree like a monkey, and yet another said Africans eat their own and practice cannibalism when there was no food, according to his complaint. When Benson asked his supervisor to put a stop to the taunts, she replied, Everyone is a little racist, according to the lawsuit, which alleges some of the co-workers also made sexually oriented remarks toward Benson.

No arrests have been made and police continue to search for suspects in the case being called a hate crime. At approximately 4 a.m. the statues and walls of St. Christopher Catholic Church were marked in spray paint with biblical statements. Security cameras showed graffiti being spray-painted on statues and other areas of St. Christopher Catholic Church, on the 6oo block of S. Glendora Avenue in West Covina, police Cpl. Rudy Lopez said. The video showed a masked man dressed in dark clothing spray-painting graffiti on the grounds of the church, including on a statue of the patron saint, St. Christopher, and the Virgin Mary. Among graffiti were references to various Biblical verses and the phrase bow down to Jehovah, Lopez said.Also vandalized some time over the weekend was nearby West Covina Christian Church, which had the words Jehovah lives spray-painted on its sign.

153,"ARCADIA, CA—The reports of abuse in the juvenile justice system have come to light in Los Angeles County, and the Board of Supervisors wants answers. The originating report at the Sylmar juvenile hall on April 24 prompted the need for reform--when four probation officers were allegedly caught beating a 17-year-old at that facility. Spurred by allegations of abuse in county juvenile halls and camps, the Board of Supervisors called today for a detailed report on three years of incidents and a review of policies and protocols. Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas recommended the review based on recent allegations that we cannot and will not ignore. Reforming our juvenile justice system remains a big, big challenge for the county of Los Angeles, Ridley-Thomas said. The District Attorneys Office is reviewing the Sylmar encounter -- captured on video and subsequently reported by the blog WitnessLA -- but has not yet made a decision on whether to file charges, according to D.A.s spokeswoman Jane Robison. WitnessLA did not make the video itself available, explaining that it involved a minor, but posted still photos with the boys face blurred. It reported that an officer slammed the 17-year-old onto a cot that amounts to a rectangular concrete block and then others piled on to knee, hold or punch the teen. A supervisor entered the room at one point while the alleged beating was in progress and then turned around and left, according to WitnessLA. On May 31, Los Angeles police were called to Central Juvenile Hall, east of downtown, to respond to a report that a youth was assaulted by a probation officer who pulled the handcuffed boy up by his sweatshirt, choking him with the garment, when the juvenile repeatedly used a racial slur, WitnessLA reported. None of the members of the board mentioned either of those alleged incidents or any other specific abuses before voting unanimously in favor of the three-year report and a review of protocols covering reporting of incidents and a discussion of how staff are held accountable. The Probation Department is responsible for managing 13 probation camps and three juvenile halls and has long struggled to protect the youth in its care. The Department of Justice monitored the countys juvenile facilities for six years, with a final report issued this past February. The Board of Supervisors has since considered broader reforms, including restructuring the Probation Department, potentially splitting units responsible for adults and minors and closing some facilities. The board has already committed to rebuild Camp Kilpatrick -- a penitentiary-style boys camp with large dorms -- as a smaller-scale, therapeutic model with boys housed in cottages of 12. It is also evaluating whether Camp Scott could be converted into a similar small-group model for girls. Stay tuned, Ridley-Thomas said today. By City News Service",0,8,5
154,"The suspected leader of a Mexican Mafia-controlled San Gabriel Valley gang that targeted black victims pleaded guilty Thursday to federal charges. James Chemo Gutierrez, 53, entered his plea to three conspiracy counts involving racketeering, narcotics distribution and money laundering, according to court documents. Gutierrez, a reputed Mexican Mafia member and head of the El Monte Flores gang, faces between 10 years to life in federal prison at his July 28 sentencing hearing, prosecutors said. Gutierrez was the lead defendant in a 41-person federal indictment detailing allegations of murder, kidnapping, drug trafficking, robbery, burglary, carjacking, witness intimidation and other offenses. The gang often committed hate crimes directed against African- Americans who might reside or be present in the cities of El Monte and South El Monte in an effort to rid these cities of all African-Americans, according to the 62-count indictment. Other gang-related crimes outlined in the 2014 document include the execution of a former Mexican Mafia member and the fatal shooting of four others in an El Monte home in 1995. The indictment also describes an ongoing dispute involving members of the Mexican Mafia who are attempting to exercise control over the gang. Gutierrez is currently in federal custody after his supervised release was revoked following a 20-year sentence in a federal homicide case. Other Mexican Mafia members serving life prison terms are not charged in the indictment, but they are listed as co-conspirators. The gang maintained a significant presence at the Boys & Girls Club in San Gabriel, where gang members openly sold drugs, held gang meetings and even held a car wash fundraiser, according to the indictment. Members of the gang also regularly used and threatened to use violence to extort taxes from local drug dealers and fraudulent document vendors, the indictment says. Prosecutors further alleged several incidents dating back to early 2001 in which black victims in El Monte were attacked, threatened and subjected to racial epithets. --City News Service, photo via Shutterstock",1,8,0
155,"By FRED SHUSTER City News Service LOS ANGELES (CNS) - Two Los Angeles County sheriffs deputies beat, kicked and pepper-sprayed a handcuffed, mentally ill inmate and then wrote false reports to cover up their actions, a prosecutor told a jury Tuesday, but defense attorneys countered that the use of force was minimal and justified by the prisoners refusal to follow orders. Joey Aguiar and Mariano Ramirez are the latest of nearly two-dozen current and former sheriffs employees to be tried by federal authorities in connection with a probe into brutality and other misconduct in the department at a time when Lee Baca was sheriff. According to the indictment, Aguiar and Ramirez violated the civil rights of a defenseless Bret Phillips by assaulting him inside Mens Central Jail on the morning of Feb. 11, 2009. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jennifer Williams told the jury that the inmate was handcuffed to a waist chain when he was smashed against a concrete wall, kicked and punched in the head and upper body, struck with a flashlight and pepper-sprayed in the face. The prosecutor maintained in her opening statement that the alleged attack was an abuse of power, abuse of the badge. It was criminal. Afterwards, the deputies huddled to get their stories straight -- verbatim straight, Williams said. She alleged that in official reports, Aguiar and Ramirez falsely wrote that force was used against Phillips because he hadnt obeyed orders and attempted to head-butt Aguiar in the face. However, there was a witness that (the defendants) hadnt counted on being there, the prosecutor said. A chaplain came forward the following day to say that he had seen the attack, Williams said. Deacon Paulino Juarez -- who was at the jail that day pushing a cart laden with Bibles and other religious material for interested inmates -- said under oath that he watched as deputies beat the inmate bloody, leaving a pool of blood on the floor, the prosecutor told the panel. Williams said Juarez will be among witnesses during the trial, which is expected to last about seven days. Vicki Podberesky, Ramirezs attorney, countered that an escalating use of force by the defendants was necessary during what she said was a minute-long incident because Phillips was resisting orders to calm down and return to his cell. Sometimes, a deputy must use force, she told the jury. It was force that was reasonable under the circumstances. As for the pool of blood the chaplain claims he saw, Evan Jenness, Aguiars lawyer, countered that the hard evidence does not match Juarezs account. What the chaplain believes he saw did not happen, Jenness said, adding that in the context of the trial, Juarez is an advocate for the prosecution. She said that, in fact, there was no blood on the floor after the incident. Jenness told the panel that a lawful amount of force was used against Phillips in order to restore order and gain control of a violent and recalcitrant inmate. Williams told the jury that Phillips had a criminal history and suffered from mental and physical illnesses. Attorney Gloria Allred filed suit in 2014 on behalf of Phillips, who she says suffers from schizophrenia. The suit, which seeks unspecified damages, claims the sheriffs department did not protect the now 45-year-old inmate from being victimized.  Aguiar and Rameriz have been relieved of duty without pay pending the outcome of the trial, a sheriffs spokeswoman said.",1,7,0
156,"An Arcadia woman is suing her former employer, alleging she was fired for refusing to participate in mandatory on-the-job Scientology classes. Annie R. Lees lawsuit against Pasadena-based Lusida Rubber Products Inc. and two company executives, Wayne Chin and William Johonnesson, alleges wrongful termination, religious discrimination, failure to prevent religious discrimination, harassment and retaliation. Lee is seeking unspecified damages and an injunction enjoining Lusida from requiring employees to take Scientology lessons. Chin declined to talk about the lawsuit today. Under the advice of my attorney, I have no comment at this time, Chin said. He said his lawyer will draft a response on his behalf in a few days. The suit states that Lee worked at Lusida Rubber from June through December of last year as a customer service representative. A month after Johonnesson was hired in September 2014, the company began requiring all employees to attend and engage in a mandatory, 30-minute class during work hours that was based on the teachings of L. Ron Hubbard and the Church of Scientology, the suit alleges. The courses were given three times a week at first, but then expanded to almost daily last December, the suit says. The sessions were not optional and every employee was required to take part regardless of their religious affiliation, according to Lees court papers. Lee claims she began feeling pressured and brainwashed into accepting thoughts, methodologies and religious beliefs that were not in line with her own faith. She says she complained about having to take the training courses, but was told she had no choice. Johonnesson, who the suit alleges advocated in favor of holding the Scientology sessions, told Lee she had to wear multiple hats or she would not be considered fit to work at Lusida, the suit states. The plaintiff contends Johonnesson repeatedly made negative remarks about other religions and urged her to denounce her existing religious beliefs and adopt Scientology as her new religion, of which Tom Cruise and John Travolta are noted followers. After one of the teaching sessions, Lee says she and other Lusida employees were asked why they took the classes and what they learned from them. Lee answered that she did not wish to be present in the classes or learn any of the Scientology teachings that she believed were being imposed on her, but that she was forced to be present, according to her court papers. Lee was fired last Dec. 18 after being given poor performance reviews, the suit states. Other workers who had the same complaints about the Scientology sessions were terminated later, according to the plaintiff.  Interestingly, most, if not all, employees who have replaced the terminated employees have been members of the Church of Scientology, the suit says. --City News Service",0,8,5
157,"This article was revised to include latest developments: Murder, attempted murder and two hit-and-run charges were filed today against rap mogul Marion Suge Knight, who could face up to life in prison if convicted. Earlier today, a commissioner revoked Knights $2 million bail. Knight, 49, surrendered early Friday and was booked on suspicion of murder for allegedly running over two men with his truck in Compton on Thursday afternoon, killing one of them, and fleeing the scene. Knights bail status was amended -- his bail had been set at $2 million - - because he was deemed a possible flight risk and three-strikes candidate. According to a sheriffs statement, possible witness intimidation issues and a criminal past were also factors. Knight is scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday at the Compton courthouse. The complaint includes an allegation that he committed a serious and violent felony while out on bail in an unrelated robbery case, as well as use of a deadly weapon and causing great bodily injury allegations. Knight has prior convictions, making this a third-strike case, according to the complaint. The hit-and-run occurred around 2:55 p.m. Thursday in the parking lot of Tams Burgers in the 1200 block of West Rosecrans Avenue, near Central Avenue. Knight allegedly drove his pickup truck backward and forward, killing Terry Carter, 55, and injuring 51-year-old Cle Stone, who was treated at a hospital. Knights attorney, James Blatt, confirmed his client was behind the wheel of the pickup that struck the men, but said he acted out of fear in trying to escape as many as four people who attacked him. Blatt also claimed that Knight had been unaware that he had hit two men with the pickup, which was later found in a Westwood parking lot. Lt. John Corina, a sheriffs homicide detective, told reporters late last week that investigators believe Knight intentionally struck the men and that he was not acting out of a reasonable fear. Corina said Knight had gotten into an argument at a film shoot for a promotional video for Straight Out of Compton, a biopic of the Compton rap group N.W.A. Knight, and was told to leave. The argument resumed about 20 minutes later at the eatery about three miles away. Corina alleged the 51-year-old victim exchanged punches with Knight through the open window of his truck before the rapper intentionally ran him over, then struck Carter -- who had been standing next to Stone -- while accelerating forward. Knights lawyer described Carter as a friend of his clients, and Corina said the victim was not believed to have been involved in the altercation with Knight. The web site TMZ.com reported that surveillance cameras at the Tams Burgers crime scene were broken and that cameras at a nearby bank, drug store and a competing fast-food outlet were pointing away from the crime scene. Sheriffs deputies, however, have said they have video of the dispute. Knight is awaiting trial on a robbery charge stemming from the alleged theft of a camera from a paparazzo in Beverly Hills last September. He is charged in that case, along with comedian Micah Katt Williams, and faces up to 30 years to life in prison if convicted in the robbery case. Knight co-founded Death Row Records, which in its heyday in the early 1990s was generating revenues of about $100 million per year. He helped launch some of raps biggest acts, including Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg and Tupac Shakur, and was with Shakur the night he was slain in 1996. Knight served five years in prison for assault and federal weapons violations and, after his release in 2001, spent another 10 months behind bars for violating parole by hitting a Hollywood nightclub valet. He was shot a half-dozen times last August at a Los Angeles-area nightclub. No arrests have been made in that case.Also on Patch Delta Will Fly Larger Planes on Shuttle From LAX to San San Diego State University Sending Wine Program Abroad Suspected Sex Workers.

160,"A lawsuit by an aircraft technician and his boss, who allege FedEx Corp. management ignored their complaints that the company put profits ahead ahead of safety, is groundless, a spokeswoman for the delivery service said Monday. These allegations have no merit and we will vigorously defend the lawsuit, FedEx spokeswoman Connie Avery said. Stanley Langevin and Mark Collins filed the whistleblower complaint last Wednesday in Los Angeles Superior Court, seeking unspecified damages. Collins, who is black and also is Langevins supervisor, additionally alleges racial discrimination. Both men, who work at FedExs Los Angeles International Airport location, allege the companys aircraft are not maintained according to Federal Aviation Administration safety requirements. Langevin, who has more than 40 years experience as an aircraft technician and also is an Air Force veteran, says he was retaliated against when he complained about the condition of many FedEx aircraft. Langevin uncovered a calculated, illegal scheme by FedEx whereby FedEx routinely and knowingly returned non-airworthy aircraft to service despite the need for further repair/maintenance in order to comply with federal aviation regulations, the suit alleges. He alleges his employer was more concerned with returning the aircraft to flight quickly and cheaply in order to increase their profits than with ensuring compliance with the federal aviation regulations. The suit alleges that supervisors routinely wrote Langevin negative memos, suspended him for fabricated reasons and coerced co-workers to come up with dirt against him so he could be disciplined and demoted. Collins, a Navy veteran who fought in the Persian Gulf War during Operation Desert Storm, alleges he faced a backlash because he defended Langevin. Collins fully supported Langevins complaints and voiced his own complaints regarding the same illegal practices, the suit alleges. Collins further objected to and refused to be a party to FedExs pattern of retaliation against the whistleblowers.  The plaintiffs further allege that Collins and other black employees were paid less than their non-black counterparts. City News Service",0,8,5
161,"Photo via Shutterstock By FRED SHUSTER City News Service LOS ANGELES (CNS) - A porn actor who extorted a wealthy telecom executive, forcing him to turn over $500,000 and a car worth nearly $180,000 so details of his paid sexual liaisons with the defendant and other X-rated performers wouldnt be revealed on social media is due in court Monday for a hearing to discuss the return of the cash. A Los Angeles federal jury deliberated about two hours Thursday before finding Teo Brank, 25, guilty of extortion and related counts stemming from the $1.5 million blackmail attempt on Florida tycoon and political donor Donald Burns. He remains jailed without bail while awaiting sentencing Sept. 21. Federal prosecutors want Brank to return the $500,000 he extorted from Burns, and attorneys are expected to discuss the forfeiture demand on Monday. Brank -- who performed under the name Jarec Wentworth in adult films and on gay porn sites -- was arrested in March in an FBI sting after an agent posing as Burns associate met with the actor at a Starbucks in El Segundo and handed over title to an Audi R8 and discussed a $1 million funds transfer. Weeks earlier, Burns had given Brank $500,000 and the Audi after the male escort and actor threatened to bring your house down by posting on Twitter details of the multimillionaires paid sexual encounters, according to evidence presented at the trial. Burns, who is the partial owner of the Internet phone company Magicjack and controls the Donald A. Burns Foundation, testified during the three-day trial that he paid men for sex to avoid emotional entanglements. Prosecutors said Brank had a two-year relationship with Burns in which the executive paid him $2,000 per sexual encounter, then asked the actor to introduce him to other male escorts, offering Brank a $2,000 referral for each introduction, and more if he joined in. The defense maintained that Burns groomed and mentored Brank, offering to help him begin a modeling career away from porn but then reneged on the promise and broke off their friendship. At that point, Brank threatened to use Twitter to expose the executives predilection for sex for pay, Assistant U.S. Attorney Eddie Jauregui told jurors. Burns panicked, Jauregui said, and when Brank demanded $500,000 and the Audi to keep quiet, the businessman complied, transferring the money to Branks bank account and delivering the car. Im just going to bite hard, Brank wrote in a text message that was introduced at trial. I want a new car, motorcycle and both hands full of cash. Jauregui said that two weeks later, Brank upped the ante, ordering Burns to hand over $1 million and the Audis certificate of title. At that point, Burns went to the FBI, and Brank was arrested in the Starbucks sting as the Palm Beach-based executive watched on a live video feed at the FBIs Westwood offices. Defense attorney Seema Ahmad insisted that Brank never threatened Burns reputation because the executive made no secret of his private life and there was nothing to expose. Instead, Brank merely wanted to tell his Twitter followers what happened to him at the hands of Burns. He wanted what was promised him, Ahmad told jurors. The defense attorney said Burns paid Brank not because he was worried about his reputation, but because he truly owed Brank the money and car for services rendered. Burns reputation was never threatened, Ahmad said, adding that Brank only asked for the money he deserved.  Brank lived most recently in Sacramento. --City News Service",0,8,5

163,"By FRED SHUSTER, City News Service Reported hate crimes in Los Angeles County declined by 6 percent in 2012 from the previous year, marking the second lowest total in 23 years,  the county Commission on Human Relations announced today. According to its annual report -- which defines a hate crime as one where hatred or prejudice toward a victims race or ethnicity, religion, disability, gender or sexual orientation was a substantial factor -- there were 462 reported hate crimes countywide last year, a decrease of 27 from 2011. We are encouraged that for several years in a row the number of hate crimes in L.A. County has been about half of those reported in the late 90s and early 2000s, said commission Executive Director Robin Toma. About 50 percent of the 2012 crimes documented in the report were race- based, with 66 percent of those targeting blacks. The report showed that 68 percent of racially motivated crimes against blacks were committed by Latinos, and 58 percent of racially motivated crimes targeting Latinos were committed by blacks. Crimes based on sexual orientation increased from the previous year to 28 percent of all the hate crimes -- and were more likely to be violent than either racial- or religious-related hated crimes. Religious crimes, which were primarily anti-Semitic in nature, declined slightly from last year, constituting 19 percent of the total. It remains troubling that year after year, the overwhelming majority of hate crimes motivated by religion in Los Angeles County, statewide and across the country, is against Jews and Jewish institutions. said Amanda Susskind, regional director of the Anti-Defamation League, a civil rights group with a focus on documenting and fighting anti-Semitism. We remain concerned that African-Americans continue to be the most frequently targeted victims of hate crimes with nearly one-third of all reported hate crimes and two-thirds of racially motivated crimes, Susskind said.  And, not only did crimes against the LGBT -- lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender -- community increase, they also became even more likely to be of a violent nature compared to last year and still vastly more likely to be violent than either racial or religious crimes. The highest rate of hate crimes took place in the metro region stretching from West Hollywood to Boyle Heights. When accounting for population, the Antelope Valley tied with the metro area for the highest numbers. In the Antelope Valley, where federal officials recently found that sheriffs deputies had discriminated against black residents, some of the white supremacist organizations have long been active, Toma said. The commissions report was generated from data collected from sheriff and city police departments, school districts and community groups. However, officials are almost incapable of monitoring hate crimes taking place in cyberspace, Susskind noted.",0,8,5
164,"LOS ANGELES (CNS) - Civil rights groups sued the Los Angeles Police Department and the Sheriffs Department today over both agencies alleged failure to produce records related to the use of automatic license plate readers. According to the lawsuit filed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, the LAPD and the Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department refuse to provide requested information on policy and training, as well as a weeks worth of ALPR data collected by the agencies last year. Mounted on squad cars and telephone poles, the camera systems read license plates and record the time, date, and location a particular car was encountered. The plaintiffs allege they filed requests under the California Public Records Act for the documents, but while the departments produced some materials, they failed to give up materials related to the sharing of information with other agencies. Neither agency has produced data collected during the one-week period, according to the complaint filed in Los Angeles Superior Court. Neither law enforcement agency immediately released a response to the suit. Location-based information like license plate data can be very revealing, said Jennifer Lynch, an EFF staff attorney. By matching your car to a particular time, date and location -- and building a database of that information over time -- law enforcement can learn where you work and live, what doctor you go to, which religious services you attend and who your friends are, she said. The public needs access to data the police actually have collected to be able to make informed decisions abouthow ALPR systems can and cant be used.

165,"A Snapchat video that allegedly showed Beaumont High School teacher Samantha Lee Ciotta wearing only a shirt and panties while drinking alcohol with two shirtless minors is at the center of a police investigation that could lead to more anticipated felony charges against the 32-year-old English teacher accused of sex with an underage student, Patch has learned. Ciotta was arrested Sept. 20 on suspicion of unlawful sex and oral copulation with a minor, and released from custody the next day after posting $150,000 bail. Police continue to investigate whether Ciotta had inappropriate sexual contact with more than one underage Beaumont High student, according to documents obtained by Patch. Ciotta is set to appear in court on Nov. 3. A high school student who spotted the scandalous Snapchat story in August asked the student who posted it if the woman in the video was Mrs. Ciotta. The reply: Yes … Bro, Im gettin in deep … been f------ (Ciotta) and getting threesomes for the past couple weeks (at her house), according to documents obtained by Patch. The other student who allegedly appeared in the Snapchat video told an adult Ciotta had sex with a student, and If [police] have her phone, then they will find out, according to documents. Samantha Ciottas booking photo. Credit: Beaumont Police Department. Police got a warrant to obtain Ciottas cell phone and search the Banning home she shared with her husband and two young children. While searching Ciottas home, detectives found a torn-up, hand-written note that mentioned the juvenile victim by name. The note appeared to be written to Samantha Ciottas husband, explaining her relationship with the underage student. Police also discovered the alleged victims school records in her home office, according to documents outlining the police investigation that began in June at the request of Child Protective Services. Ciottas first known relationship with the alleged victim started nearly two years earlier, according to law enforcement documents, school records and interviews with the students family members. The former teacher allegedly took a special interest in the underage boy failing her English class. He was described in documents as a disruptive student and an incorrigible juvenile. Ciotta even asked to participate in a hearing to discuss the boys individualized education plan, sources said. She said she was his advocate, the boys guardian said. AN EYE-OPENER Ciotta and her alleged victim both started at Beaumont High School in August 2015. It was a fresh start at a new school for Ciotta, then a 29-year-old married mom who previously taught English at La Quinta High School in the Coachella Valley. The boy, a 14-year-old orphan living with a family member after his mother died and his father was sent to prison, had just started his freshman year. They met in Ciottas English class, the only one the boy was failing within the first month of school, according to Beaumont High records. Ciotta offered to provide her alleged victim with extra help, the boys guardian said. A few months later, in February, Ciotta sent the boys guardian an email: I was losing [victims name deleted] in the classroom due to his behavior, Ciotta wrote. The last confrontation [he] and I had, I felt, was an eye-opener for him and he was much better yesterday. I hope to see him improve and show some accountability for his grade in my class, as well as all other classes ... he has so much potential. The boys guardian said she wasnt immediately concerned because the boy, who was enrolled in special education services, needed help in school and had been prone to violent outbursts since fourth grade, records show. I cant change what [he and his siblings] went through before they came to me, the boys guardian said. She said she tried to create a home environment with rules and consequences for not following those rules. They moved to Beaumont in 2013. The boy seemed to be improving at his new school and had adjusted well to the move, she said. The boys guardian told Patch she saw a change for the worse in the boy as his sophomore year at Beaumont High approached. He came home with expensive shoes, a new iPhone, fancy Bluetooth speakers. At first I thought it was drug money, the boys guardian said. She now believes the iPhone and other luxuries were gifts from Ciotta. The summer before school began, the boys guardian told Patch, he started to act out. She couldnt control him and had no choice but to call the police. Police first responded to the home on July 31, 2016, to investigate a complaint of an incorrigible juvenile — a call related to a minor who repeatedly disobeys a parent or guardians direction, police records show. Four days later, officers came to the house to investigate a missing juvenile complaint. Police returned to the house five more times in response to incorrigible juvenile complaints between Aug. 26 and Sept. 20, 2016. On Sept. 21, the boy ran away from home. Police responded to the house eight more times between Sept. 22 and Nov. 15, 2016, including a call reporting that the boy struck his guardian, according to police records. The alleged battery happened Nov. 3, 2016, when the boys guardian confronted him about her suspicion that he was selling drugs. The boy was charged in juvenile court, the guardian said. He ran away from home again the same day and never came back. For months, his guardian didnt know where he was living. In January 2017, the boys guardian was charged with child neglect, police records show. Still, the boys guardian was notified via email of the boys progress at school. In April, she attempted to attend a meeting about the status of the teenagers individualized education plan. Thats where she met Ciotta. She was only there to give me her input and thats what made it more apparent that something was going on because she attacked me on my upbringing of (the boy), the guardian wrote in a text message. I told her to stay away from him. TEXTS, SNAPS, NOTE LEAD TO ARREST On June 8, one of the boys relatives sent him a text asking the child if he indeed had a sexual relationship with Ciotta, according to an investigative report obtained by Patch. The family member told police she immediately knew that the text [reply] was not sent by [the boy] based on language used in the message. When the boys relative texted again, Uh, nevermind, the sender replied, My lawyer will contact you. That reply actually came from Ciottas husband. According to the report, the boys relative told police she believed Ciottas husband was using the boys iPhone. The text from the husband stated that he needed to know the extent of what happened … I deserve that much. Im not mad at [the boy]. Not even a little bit. Reached by phone on Monday, Ciottas husband, Scott Ciotta, confirmed to Patch he sent those text messages from the iPhone that he and his wife bought for the boy. Following that text message exchange, police interviewed the alleged victim, who denied having an inappropriate relationship with Ciotta, records show. When asked why kids were spreading those rumors, [he] stated that he thought it was because Ciotta would allow him to spend several periods in her class to do his work, according to the report. When it was time for him to leave, she would walk him to his classes so he would avoid getting a tardy. The boy told police he did have Ciottas cellphone number, but he only used it in case [he] needed a ride. Police questioned the boy about whether he visited Ciottas house. Initially, the boy denied visiting his teacher at home. Later, he changed his story. Alright, I have been to her house, the boy told police. When detectives asked the for details about when he visited Ciottas house, he became angry and stated Im done, and Ive moved on. Im not f------ talking! documents show. Police searched Ciottas home nine days later. In her home office, detectives found a note that appeared to be Ciottas attempt to explain her relationship with her student to her husband. On Sept. 1, Beaumont Unified School District officials contacted police about rumors of a scantily clad Ciotta appearing with the victim and other unidentified students in a Snapchat video. Six days later, a Beaumont High parent told police her underage child confirmed that Ciotta had an inappropriate relationship with the alleged victim and if police search the teachers phone they will find out. On Sept. 20, Ciottas arrest shocked the Beaumont High community and made national headlines. Ciotta, who was placed on administrative leave and remains free on bond, declined our request to comment. Ciottas husband filed for divorce Oct. 4, has since moved out of the family home and was granted temporary sole custody of their two children, according to court papers. While I, personally, do not believe my children were placed in any danger while in her care, nor do I question her abilities as a mother, I am following CPSs recommendations, Ciottas husband, acting as his own attorney, wrote in divorce papers. Child Protective Services strongly recommended to me to take full custody and with urgency. Despite the court filing, Scott Ciotta on Monday said his wife is a great mother ... and that myself and her family are very supportive of her. He declined to answer other questions, including whether the alleged victim ever stayed at his familys home. I know you likely want to paint a negative picture that will get many readers to your site but dont forget there are always multiple sides to a story, Scott Ciotta wrote in a text message. SCHOOL SHAKEN BY MORE SEX CHARGES; PUNCH IN THE GUT This month, two more Beaumont High teachers made headlines for alleged inappropriate contact with students. The trio of investigations has angered and disappointed parents. On Oct. 2, a second Beaumont High English teacher was arrested and subsequently charged with allegedly having sexual contact with an underage student. Beaumont High School teacher Christina Chris Austin, who also goes by the last name Jacobson, was charged with having an illegal relationship with a 16-year-old female student. She quit her job when approached by school officials. The 37-year-old teacher was arraigned Oct. 5 and pleaded not guilty to two felony counts of oral copulation on a person under 18, two felony counts of sexual penetration by a foreign object and two felony counts of contacting a minor for sexual offense. Shes due back in court Oct. 26. Last week, police announced that a Beaumont High teacher and football coach was caught on camera punching a student in the gut. The teacher, identified by NBC4 as Will Martin, is on administrative leave while police investigate whether to press criminal charges. » WATCH THE VIDEO Some Beaumont High parents told Patch they are dismayed the school hasnt done more. I was disappointed in the school and the people they are putting in front of our students who are supposed to be good role models, Megan Clifton said. Several parents expressed concern their children told them they were aware that certain teachers were having inappropriate relationships with students long before the administration took action. Im beyond disturbed by the fact that my son said, Mom a lot of kids know about it, said a parent who asked not to be identified. I hate that these are issues my son has to deal with on a basis where he sees it as no big deal. Following Ciottas arrest, Beaumont High officials issued a statement saying they are expanding our training for staff to identify signs of inappropriate conduct. The school administration on Monday could not yet provide details about the new training initiatives. Beaumont Unified School District board president Steven Hovey did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Clifton, whose son was in Ciottas class until her arrest, said she expects more action from the administration. From the first moment you hear, they have a duty and responsibility to let us know, she said. I find it shocking the school district isnt doing more.

166,"A man who accidentally shot himself during an alleged attempt to kill a black employee at a Desert Hot Springs auto parts store must stand trial for attempted murder and hate crime charges, a judge ruled Wednesday. Rudy Arana, 19, allegedly brought a sawed-off shotgun to an Autozone store on March 30, and following a tussle with the employee that brought both men to the ground, shot himself in the lower body, according to Desert Hot Springs police. The employee testified Wednesday that as the work day started, he saw Arana trying to get into his car in the parking lot. He told Arana to leave, but he allegedly returned a short time later and asked other employees where the victim was, while calling himself an N-word killer, according to court documents. After continuing to loiter near the store, Arana saw the employee he was seeking when the worker left the store to take out the trash, the victim testified. As they wrestled for control of the gun, Arana allegedly cursed at the employee and referred to him using the N-word, saying, Im going to kill you, the victim testified. He said two shots were fired during the struggle, including the shot that struck Arana. Arana was taken to a hospital for treatment of his injuries and was later placed under arrest. No one else was injured in the shooting. Arana was later charged with attempted murder, along with multiple sentence-enhancing allegations, including hate crime, firearm and gang allegations. He will return to court Aug. 2 for a post-preliminary hearing arraignment. He remains jailed on $1 million bail. – By City News Service / Image via Shutterstock",1,0,0
167,"By Bay City News Service: A man carrying a small knife was arrested late Sunday in Palo Alto after allegedly using a racial epithet against a black man and threatening to kill him inside a parking garage, police said Monday. Tony Smith, 61, of Mountain View, was booked into the Santa Clara County Main Jail on suspicion of felony criminal threats and a hate crime and misdemeanor possession of methamphetamine, police said. The victim phoned police at 11:47 p.m. from a business in the 500 block of Ramona Street to report that a possible carjacking attempt occurred in a parking lot at 539 Emerson St., according to police. Officers responded to the area and located a suspect standing outside the business, holding a knife with a 2-inch blade in his hand. They arrested the suspect, later identified as Smith, without incident, officers said. The victim, a black man in his 30s, told officers that he was sitting in his car with the engine running in the Emerson Street lot when a stranger approached and opened the cars passenger door, police said. The suspect told the man that he had a gun and that the victim was going to die. The victim did not see a gun but exited the car, with the engine still running, and backed away, according to police. The stranger then used a racial slur and repeated that the victim was going to die. The victim, who left his cellphone in his car, then went to a business to call police, police said. It appeared that the suspect had followed the man, although he did not attempt to steal the car, police said. Police recovered a quantity of methamphetamine from Smiths belongings but he was not carrying a gun, according to police.

169,"A Signal Hill man was sentenced Wednesday to 32 years and four months in state prison for the beating death of his live-in girlfriends 2-year-old son. Long Beach Superior Court Judge Laura Laesecke told Samuel Aguilar that he would have a long time to think about how much of an impact his actions have had on the boys relatives. After his sentence was handed down, the 24-year-old defendant turned to face the victims family members and told them, Believe me when I tell you that I know you guys hate me ... Im sorry you lost him ... Im going to serve 32 years in prison. Aguilar said he had taught the victims younger brother how to walk and that the tot had called him Dad, prompting one of the victims relatives to rush out of the courtroom. One of the boys family members said she hoped the severity of Aguilars crimes would one day sink in for him. The toddler was literally beaten to death, she said, noting that the childs casket had to be closed due to excessive bruising all over his body. The boys grandmother told the judge she has a collage frame in her house with photos of all of her grandchildren, but that one of the pictures -- of her first grandson -- will never be updated with anything past that of him at 2 years old. Aguilar and the toddlers mother, Jessica Cereceres, now 26, were charged just over a year ago in connection with the boys death. Cereceres pleaded no contest May 4 to a pair of felony abuse counts. She was sentenced to five years and four months in prison and ordered to stay away from her surviving child for 10 years. Aguilar pleaded no contest to voluntary manslaughter as a jury was set to begin hearing the case against him Sept. 12. He also pleaded no contest to three counts of dissuading a witness from reporting a crime, two counts of child abuse and one count of injuring a spouse or cohabitant. Two other counts, including a murder charge, were dismissed as a result of his plea, under which Aguilar agreed to waive credit for the time he has already spent behind bars. He has been jailed since December 2014, when he was arrested for witness intimidation/dissuasion. The victim, identified by the Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department as Josue Maldonado, was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead, after Signal Hill police responded to a call that the toddler wasnt breathing on Aug. 10, 2014. Investigators discovered that the boys 1-year-old brother also had injuries to his body, said Deputy District Attorney L. Christmas Brookens. Aguilar and Cereceres were charged in 2015 following a yearlong examination of reports and evidence involving injuries to her two children, including a determination that the older boy had died from blunt force trauma to the head and stomach, according to the prosecutor. Authorities concluded that the injuries occurred while the 2-year-old was in Aguilars care and following a physical argument with Cereceres, the prosecutor said. Witnesses told authorities that they saw Aguilar abusing the two boys in front of his girlfriend and that she would do nothing, Brookens said. -- City News Service, photo via Shutterstock",0,8,5
170,"- A Vallejo police officer has been placed on administrative leave pending the completion of an investigation of a citizen report that the officer used a racial slur during a traffic stop. The alleged incident occurred about 4 p.m. Saturday as two Vallejo police officers conducted a traffic stop of potential suspects in a carjacking that had been reported in a nearby jurisdiction, Vallejo police Lt. Jeff Bassett stated in a news release. A resident in the area observed the car stop and video recorded the action with his mobile phone, Bassett said. The citizen reports the officer used an unacceptable racial [epithet] during the initial contact. According to Bassett, the Vallejo Police Department takes all reports of unprofessional behavior seriously and has no tolerance for such behavior. The chief of police ordered an immediate investigation into the incident, and the involved officer was identified and placed on leave pending the completion of the investigation, Bassett said. The officers name was not disclosed. At least one of the suspects involved in the traffic stop was arrested Saturday on suspicion of the carjacking reported in Napa County, the Vallejo Times-Herald reported Monday. The officer used profanity but there were no racial overtones, Vallejo Police Lt. Kevin Bartlett told the Times-Herald. The occupants of the vehicle said they didnt hear the officer use a racial slur. Bartlett told the newspaper that the video and audio would be enhanced to determine what was said. On Monday, the city of Vallejo posted a clip of the citizens video to YouTube, stating in the video description that the Vallejo Police Department is asking for a retraction and correction of a news story erroneously claiming that a Vallejo Police Officer used a derogatory racial slur during a high risk vehicle stop of a car-jacking suspect: Image via City of Vallejo/YouTube",1,0,3
171,"Two of three fires that occurred within an hour of each other in Santa Rosa on Monday were preventable, fire officials said today. The first fire at 7:04 p.m. spread up the side of a residence at 5374 Gold Drive and into the attic, Santa Rosa Fire Battalion Chief Ken Sebastiani said. The fire was contained to the attic of a back bedroom and was quickly extinguished, with damage estimated at $40,000, Sebastiani said. The fire started when a resident used a propane torch to burn weeds close to a wood pile on the side of the house, Assistant Fire Marshal Paul Lowenthal said. Using an open flame to burn vegetation is not permissible in Santa Rosa city limits, Lowenthal said. The second fire was reported six minutes later at a two-story apartment at 1106 Prospect Ave., where smoke and flames were coming from the first- and second-story windows, Deputy Fire Chief Bill Shubin said. The four residents made it safely out of the apartment but a cat perished, Shubin said. The fire was under control within 20 minutes, Shubin said. Lowenthal said the blaze that destroyed the apartment is under investigation and damage is estimated at $300,000. A structure fire at 993 Butte Drive in northwest Santa Rosa was then reported at 8:04 p.m., Sebastiani said. Firefighters arrived four minutes later and found bystanders using a garden hose to put out the 9-square-foot blaze on the shake shingle roof of the building, Sebastiani said. Firefighters found the remnants of an improvised airborne paper lantern in the center of the scorched roof of the residence, Sebastiani said. On Jan. 14, firefighters found the remnants of a similar lantern on the burning roof of a commercial building in the 900 block of Piner Road, Lowenthal said. The two lanterns are nearly identical and both structures are located close to each other, Lowenthal said. The lanterns are typically made of oiled rice paper on a bamboo frame and contain a small candle or fuel cell, but the lanterns suspected of causing the two fires had a flexible wire frame, Lowenthal said. Firefighters couldnt tell if the lanterns had a candle or fuel cell. The lanterns are not technically considered an illegal pyrotechnic device or firework, but a person using one can be held responsible if it causes a fire, Lowenthal said. The lanterns often are used at weddings and religious celebrations and Cal Fire is concerned about them causing wildland fires, Lowenthal said. --Bay City News",0,8,5
172,"A woman killed by a suicide bomber during a military deployment in Afghanistan on Monday had recently moved to the Bay Area with her wife and son. U.S. Air Force Maj. Adrianna Vorderbruggen, 36, was killed along with five other U.S. military personnel by a suicide bomber on a motorcycle outside Bagram Airfield, Afghanistan, on Dec. 21. Our deepest sympathies go out to the families of these brave Americans who died in service to this vital mission, and our thoughts remain with all of our troops serving overseas during this holiday season so that we may have peace and security at home, U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter said in a statement. Originally from Plymouth, Minnesota, Vorderbruggen had been living with her wife, Heather Lamb, and son, Jacob, in Florida. They recently moved to San Rafael to live with Lambs mother just before Vorderbruggen was deployed to Afghanistan, according to the Military Partners and Families Coalition, an organization providing support to families of LGBT service members. Vorderbruggen was one of the first gay people in the U.S. military to have her marriage legally recognized when the countrys controversial Dont Ask Dont Tell policy was repealed five years ago. She celebrated by signing her family up for military benefits, according to the coalition. A statement on the coalitions Facebook page said, We can take small comfort in the fact that they will be extended the same rights and protections due any American military family as they move through this incredibly difficult period in their lives. She was one of the most friendly and laid-back people you could ever hope to meet and was an accomplished airman, a great athlete, and most of all, a wonderful mom, coalition representatives wrote. She leaves an indelible legacy of strength and selflessness to all those touched by her life. Vorderbruggen had been with the Air Force since enrolling in the U.S. Air Force Academy in 1998. She earned a masters degree in forensic sciences from Georgetown University in 2010 and worked as a forensic science consultant with the Air Force, according to her LinkedIn page. --Bay City News",1,1,0
173,"The FBI is part of an investigation into a suspicious substance delivered to a Council on American-Islamic Relations office in Santa Clara on Thursday. Officers and fire crews responded to a report of an envelope containing white powder at CAIRs office at a two-story building at 3000 Scott Blvd. at about 1:15 p.m., police Lt. Kurt Clarke said. Firefighters responded to the scene, evacuated the building and called for a hazardous materials team that found the envelope, Clarke said. The team conducted an investigation that continued into the night with help from Santa Clara County Fire Department, according to Clarke. Three employees at the office were taken to a hospital as a precaution and were released later that night, according to the advocacy groups Bay Area executive director Zahra Billoo, who was not at the office on Thursday afternoon. FBI investigators who also responded to the scene Thursday collected evidence and took possession of the letter, which is being processed at a lab, FBI spokeswoman Michele Ernst said. Earlier on Thursday the groups headquarters in Washington D.C. was evacuated due to a foreign substance found in the mail, the organization said on Twitter. Preliminary tests of the substance sent to the Washington D.C. office showed it was not dangerous and the FBI will continue to test the letter, the organization said on Twitter. CAIRs Santa Clara office was not reopened today and the organization is working with law enforcement officials to make sure all safety measures are taken, Billoo said. Our biggest concern is the rise in Islamophobia and hate attacks on American Muslims across the country. We are worried about how normal this is becoming, Billoo said. -Bay City News Service",1,0,3

175,"A homeless Hispanic man was charged Thursday with assault with a deadly weapon and a hate crime enhancement for alleging attacking an Asian-American man with a rock in downtown Berkeley on Tuesday morning, prosecutors and police said. Jeffrey Pachingger, 38, voluntarily came to the Berkeley Police Department after the alleged attack at the bike racks at Shattuck Avenue and Center Street at about 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday and admitted to hitting the victim with a rock because of an illegal Asian takeover, Officer Jason Muniz wrote in a probable cause statement. When he was interviewed after being notified of his rights, Pachingger admitted to willfully trying to kill the victim because of his ethnicity and his belief of an Asian takeover, Muniz said. Police spokesman Officer Byron White said the victim returned to the bike racks at Shattuck Avenue and Center Street and bent over to unlock his bike when a suspect, later identified as Pachingger, struck him from behind in the back of his head with a large rock. Muniz said the victim felt dizzy and thought he was going to lose consciousness and ran north on Shattuck Avenue because he thought Pachingger would hit him again. The victim was transported to a hospital to be treated for a head injury, White said. The violent attack was at least the second by a homeless person in downtown Berkeley in less than a week, as on June 13 a homeless man punched a police officer and gave her a concussion when she tried to help him at the corner of Allston Way and Shattuck Avenue. Muniz said he arrested Pachingger on suspicion of attempted murder and commission of a hate crime because hitting the victim in the back of his head with a rock could have caused death or serious bodily injury and because he admitted that he hit the victim with a rock because he was trying to kill him. Pachingger also admitted that his malice toward the victim was due to the victims ethnicity, Muniz wrote. However, the Alameda County District Attorneys Office decided to charge Pachingger with assault with a deadly weapon instead of attempted murder. In addition, it charged him with battery with serious bodily injury. Pachingger, whos being held at the Berkeley Jail in lieu of $130,000 bail, was arraigned today and is scheduled to return to court on Friday to possibly enter a plea. — Bay City News; Image via Shutterstock",1,0,0

177,"A federal judge in San Francisco, saying he wanted more briefing on disability issues, delayed the trial of a lawsuit on the death of a schizophrenic transgender woman who died in Berkeley police custody. Kayla Moore, 41, collapsed in the early morning of Feb. 13, 2013, during a struggle with police who were summoned to her Berkeley apartment by her roommate. She was declared dead at a hospital shortly afterwards. Her father, Arthur Moore, contends in a 2014 lawsuit against the city that the police violated the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act by failing to provide a reasonable accommodation for her mental illness during the encounter. The jury trial had been scheduled to begin in the court of U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer on Nov. 6. But Breyer said during a pretrial hearing Wednesday that he wanted more clarification on what the family believes the accommodations should have been and whether they would have made a difference in preventing Moores death. What are the reasonable accommodations that should have been put in place? Breyer asked. You have to demonstrate how the accommodation would have made a difference in this particular case, he told Arthur Moores attorney, Adante Pointer. The judge said a possible example of an accommodation might be that the police should have given more time to the situation. He told Pointer to submit a brief by Nov. 18. The city of Berkeley has one week after that to respond. Breyer said he will issue an order after reviewing the filings. The order could be either the setting of a new trial date, scheduling an additional pretrial hearing, or dismissing the case in a summary judgment without a trial. Outside of court, Pointer said, I think the judge wants to see if theres enough for the case to go to the jury. He said he is confident the case will be granted a trial. In earlier pretrial proceedings, Breyer dismissed other claims in the suit, including arguments of wrongful death and use of excessive force, but left in the Americans with Disabilities Act claim. At a rally of about 25 family members and supporters outside the Federal Building before hearing, supporter Peyton Provenzano said the remaining claim was important. There is the potential for a precedent to be set for how police deal with people with disabilities, she said. Moore, who weighed 347 pounds, had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and was a heavy smoker who used crack cocaine and methamphetamine, according to a 2013 Berkeley police report. Her family claims she died of asphyxiation when several officers sat on her after handcuffing her while attempting to subdue her. The city contends she died of cardiac arrest due to combination of a toxic amount of methamphetamine in her system and a diseased and damaged heart. — Bay City News; Image via Shutterstock Also See:",0,8,5
178,"Police arrested 13 people Sunday who attended demonstrations in Berkeley. According to Berkeley police, the 13 suspects were arrested on suspicion of various offenses, including assault with a deadly weapon, felony assault and violating the Berkeley Municipal Code. The youngest suspect is a 20-year-old man from Santa Rosa, and the oldest is a 47-year-old man from Portland, Oregon, police said. Most of the suspects arrested are from Berkeley and Oakland. One suspect is from Sparks, Nevada, police said. Police said one officer was injured during an arrest and several other officers were struck with paint. Six people were injured during the demonstrations and were treated by paramedics. Two of those individuals were taken to hospitals for treatment, police said. A rally called No to Marxism took place at Berkeleys Martin Luther King Jr. Civic Center Park. Police estimated that about 4,000 people attended the rally. A separate demonstration called the Rally Against Hate took place a few blocks away at Oxford and Addison streets on the West Crescent lawn on the campus of the University of California at Berkeley.

179,"Two University of California at Berkeley students have been charged with felony vandalism for allegedly spray-painting graffiti against police officers and white people near the universitys campus recently, prosecutors said. Berkeley police said the graffiti that allegedly was painted by Ismael Chamu and Peter Estrada, both 21, who also are charged with misdemeanor possession of tools to commit vandalism or graffiti, was found on June 28 on peoples cars and fences in areas south of the universitys main campus. More specifically, Sgt. Peter Hong wrote in a probable cause declaration that the graffiti was found at a university dormitory at Durant Avenue and Dana Street, at the Clark Kerr Campus, in the 2400 block of Hillside Avenue, a fraternity house in the 2400 block of Prospect Street and the 2400 block of Durant Avenue. Additional graffiti was found in the 2500 block of Dana Street, the 2500 block of Dwight Way, at Dana and Haste streets and at Haste and Ellsworth streets, Hong wrote. Among the messages were F--- White People, F--- the police, F--- frat Boys, Kill Cops and Kill Yuppies, Eat the Rich, Class War and Black Lives Matter, Hong wrote. The graffiti also contained many messages about Philando Castile, a black man who was fatally shot by a police officer in Minnesota last year, according to Hong. A judge signed warrants for Chamu and Estrada on July 7 and Chamu was arrested at his recently acquired apartment in San Francisco on Thursday and Estrada was arrested at his apartment near the UC Berkeley campus on Friday, Hong wrote. Chamu refused to speak to officers and invoked his right to an attorney, according to Hong. Chamus Facebook page included many messages that were consistent with the graffiti messages, such as f--- the police, rebellion, Black Lives Matter, God Bless Antifa, White Nationalism and supremacy, tech development and its negative impact on Black and Brown bodies, Hong wrote. At Estradas home, officers found many items belonging to Chamu, as well as many others related to anarchism and anti-fascism, according to Hong. Hong wrote, Estrada had numerous stickers and literature, but several were notable in their messages: Antifas with the Adidas brand symbol, Defending Our Hoods with a picture of a knife, Die Techie Scum, Attack White Supremacy, and Attack the Police which were consistent with the graffiti messages. Estrada also declined to speak with police and asked for an attorney, according to Hong. Berkeley police recommended that Chamu and Estrada be charged with hate crimes, but the Alameda County District Attorneys Office didnt file those charges against them. A spokeswoman for the district attorneys office said, After careful and thorough review, the charges filed against the two defendants were in line with what the evidence shows us. Chamu and Estrada were scheduled to appear in Alameda County Superior Court this morning to be assigned attorneys and possibly enter pleas. — Bay City News Also See:",1,0,2

181,"The Golden State Killer terrorized parts of California in the 1970s and 80s, and the case has captivated investigators, writers, and internet sleuths for decades. A dedicated cold case website curated evidence, articles, timelines and maps detailing the crimes and helped spur the creation of internet forums that overflowed with wild theories and discussions. But now that an arrest has been made, some of those theories — no matter how unlikely they sounded just two days ago — might not seem so far-fetched now. The Golden State Killer, also known as the East Area Rapist and Original Night Stalker, is one of the most prolific serial rapists and murderers in the nations history – sexually assaulting 51 women and killing 12 from 1974 to 1986. More than 30 years later, Joseph James DeAngelo, 72, was arrested at his home in Citrus Heights and charged with two murders in the Golden State Killer case. Investigators obtained DeAngelos discarded DNA and positively identified DeAngelo as the man who committed multiple crimes, according to Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones. Coincidentally, the arrest took place on National DNA Day, which commemorates the discovery of the DNA double helix, Vox reported. Over the years, books such as Hunting a Psychopath: The East Area Rapist/Original Night Stalker Investigation, written by Richard Shelby, an original investigator of the case, along with documentaries, internet sleuths and couch detectives, have kept the case alive. The Cold Case website was created, dedicated to the victims and their families. A subreddit was also established specifically for the case. With thirty-two years of amateurs and professionals alike pouring over evidence time and time again, some interesting (if not far-fetched) theories bounced around. Related: Golden State Killer, Nightstalker Caught Decades Later: Cops Here are five theories that may once have seemed crazy, but after DeAngelos arrest, might not be so out there: Theory: Victim statements about the killers bad smell and the bizarre reactions from scent-hounds are linked. In almost a dozen attacks, victims of the East Area Rapist described his smell as strong, unpleasant, and very bad. The victim of the Oct. 7, 1978 attack in Concord, California, described the attackers odor as a musty smell, like cinnamon. Later, scent hounds used to track the attacker were sometimes erratic, and couldnt follow the assailants smell for more than a few blocks, according to the cold case website. What We Know Now: In 1979, DeAngelo was arrested for shoplifting a can of dog repellent and a hammer. Since his arrest Wednesday, theorists say dog repellent may have been behind the assailants pungent odor, as well as the reason that scent hounds behaved unusually and couldnt track his scent. Theory: The killer cried out Bonnie, not mommy after one assault. One of the more intriguing facts about the East Area Rapist case is that the assailant would often break down sobbing, sometimes mentioning his mother and sometimes softly cursing while attacking his victims, according to the cold case website. During the attack on May 28, 1977 in Sacramento, he was heard saying It scares my mommy when its on the news. It scares my mommy when its on the news. In the Sacramento attack on Oct. 29, 1977, he was heard saying Im sorry, Mommy. Help me. I dont want to do this anymore, Mommy. Oh, Mom. Somebody, please help me. In the Davis attack on July 6, 1978, he cries for someone else. Sheila Singleton, a 36-year-old mother, was woken up by her attacker and raped. After the rape, the assailant laid his head on the pillow next to her and began sobbing, and the victim heard him say I hate you. I hate you. I hate you Bonnie, according to Hunting a Psychopath. Although the victim was not certain that he was saying Bonnie, she said thats what it sounded like. What We Know Now: A newspaper clipping has surfaced of an engagement announcement between Bonnie Jean Colwell and Joseph James DeAngelo, Jr. Although they were engaged in 1970, there is no evidence of them ever getting married. DeAngelo married Sharon Huddle three years later. They had three daughters together before Huddle, an attorney, divorced DeAngelo in 1991, according to the Sacramento Bee. Theory: The killer worked in law enforcement while committing the crimes. A popular theory is that the Golden State Killer was in law enforcement, which is how he was able to stay under the radar for as long as he did. In a series of carefully planned attacks, the killer studied his victims schedules, broke into their homes and prepared for the crimes beforehand, according to The New York Times. Police long suspected the killer had experience in law enforcement, as he was known to use sophisticated knots to bind his victims, Vox reported. What We Know Now: DeAngelo served in the Navy during the Vietnam War, and worked as a police officer in Exeter and Auburn between 1973 and 1979 before he was fired. According to a timeline of the Golden State Killers 58 attacks and attempted attacks, 50 of the incidents came before DeAngelos arrest in August of 1979. DeAngelo attempted to appeal his firing, but dropped it in November 1979. During the period of time between August and November 1979, only one documented attack occurred on Oct. 1 — and it was botched, according to the cold case website. The few remaining attacks happened from December 1979 through October 1987, and were mainly in Southern California. Theorists believe that DeAngelos shoplifting incident, followed by getting fired, may explain the lapse in crimes committed by the Golden State Killer during this period of time. Theory: The killer worked in construction, or another home improvement field. One popular theory was that the East Area Rapist worked in construction, or another home improvement field. In 1977, traces of a very specific, uncommon type of paint were found at a couple of consecutive East Area Rapist attacks in Sacramento, according to the cold case website. In 2013, Los Angeles Magazine reported that traces of paint were found in three crimes scenes previously tied to the killer located in Irvine and Sacramento. There was also a punishment map, a detailed map drawn with the word punishment scrawled on the back, found at one of the crime scenes, according to the cold case website. Authorities said it was done with such care and was so detailed that it had to come from someone who worked in the architecture or development field, the website said. What We Know Now: In the engagement announcement to Bonnie, the announcement mentions that he was employed at Sierra Crane and Hoist, Co. – a construction company based in Newcastle, California. Theory: The Golden State Killer was also the Visalia Ransacker. Many theorists have toyed with the idea that the Visalia Ransacker and Golden State Killer were actually the same person. The Visalia Ransacker was a serial burglar, who is suspected of committing more than 100 crimes from 1974 to 1975, breaking into single-family homes and tearing apart the interior, while stealing only small items. The Golden State Killer was also known to steal money, jewelry, or various trinkets from his victims. What We Know Now: This theory may prove to be true. So far, DeAngelo has been charged with two murders that had been linked to the Golden State Killer, and is suspected in more than a dozen other crimes – including the Visalia Ransacker crime spree, according to The Fresno Bee. The Visalia Police Department released a statement Wednesday saying it believes the cases of the Golden State Killer and Visalia Ransacker are related, the newspaper reported.

182,"- A key prosecution witness in the murder case against Robert Durst denied Friday that he concocted his account of the New York real estate scion confessing outside a New York City restaurant to the killing of a mutual friend at her Los Angeles home. Nathan Nick Chavin -- who described himself as a longtime friend of Durst -- acknowledged that it took about seven months of discussions with prosecutors before he told them about Dursts alleged confession to Susan Bermans December 2000 killing. He said he wasnt ready earlier to disclose what he had heard. Durst is charged with murdering Berman, 55, with prosecutors theorizing that Durst killed Berman because police in New York were about to question her in a renewed investigation into the disappearance of Dursts first wife, Kathleen, who vanished in 1982. Attorneys spent more than two days questioning Chavin, who has been given police protection for more than two weeks since prosecutors disclosed to the defense that he is one of the mystery witnesses they wanted to examine early so they could preserve his testimony. Deputy District Attorney John Lewin told the judge that attorneys will return to court April 25 for another series of so-called conditional examinations of four more witnesses, including one more mystery witness. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Mark E Windham has noted that the testimony -- which was videotaped -- will only be shown to a jury if a witness is unavailable. During his final day on the stand, Chavin described Durst as being matter of fact and a little sad when Durst said about Berman in December 2014, It was her or me. I had no choice. Chavin said he eventually decided to tell prosecutors in late October 2015 what Durst had told him because he felt what happened to Berman outweighed his loyalty to Durst. He said he would otherwise be dishonoring her memory and his friendship with Berman, who was also a close friend of his. On cross-examination, the defense presented Chavin with a copy of an e- mail exchange between he and Durst in May 2014, in which Chavin responded, Gracias for dinner last night. That wasnt when we had dinner, he told Dursts lead attorney, Dick DeGuerin. Chavin later said he wasnt sure if the two had dinner together more than once that year. Thats not my recollection, the witness said. Under renewed questioning by the prosecutor, Chavin testified that it was clearly the words It was her or me of which he had a better memory than the exact date the two had dinner. He said he wasnt certain if Durst had used a credit card to pay for the dinner. DeGuerin suggested in his questioning that it took months for Chavin to come up with a story. But Chavin responded, I didnt ever come up with a story. He said he had been reluctant to tell prosecutors the entire account of his post-dinner conversation with Durst in 2014, testifying that I hadnt come to grips with what I wanted to say. Clearly its your position and your testimony that Mr. Durst ... confessed to you by saying, It was her or me. I had no choice, DeGuerin said. Yes, the witness responded. Chavin said he didnt deny acknowledging to the prosecution during a July 2015 interview that it would have put him in good graces with Dursts brother, Douglas, if he told authorities that Durst had confessed to him that he had been involved in the killings. It sure would, but it would make me a liar, Chavin said in the July 2015 interview. He had noted at one point during his testimony that the two siblings hate each other, but said later he wasnt sure that Dursts brother would have wanted to see his sibling incarcerated for the rest of his life. I wouldnt call it lying ... I wasnt ready to talk about it then, he said of another interview with prosecutors in April 2015 in which he said Durst sort of shrugged and kind of mumbled something when Chavin asked him about Berman. DeGuerin also showed the witness a transcript from another interview in which Lewin asked if Chavin would tell him if Durst had confessed to killing Berman. Yes, I would tell you, the witness responded, according to the transcript. Chavin described himself as waffling at the time and said he should have simply said that he didnt want to talk to them about it. I know I didnt want to speak about it then, the way I avoided answering his questions, the witness said. In his testimony Thursday, Chavin said Durst had asked to meet him for dinner because he wanted to talk to me about Kathie and Susan. After Dursts alleged confession to Bermans killing, Chavin said he asked Durst about his long-missing wife, but he got no response as Durst walked away from their dinner meeting. Asked if he still felt a bond with Durst, Chavin said, It sounds ridiculous, but yes. This was a best friend who admitted to killing my other best friend, Chavin testified. Chavin also testified that after Kathleen Dursts disappearance, Berman told him that Durst had confessed to killing her. Chavin -- whose identity had been kept secret from the public until he was called to the stand Wednesday -- testified that he initially didnt believe Berman. He said Berman told him there was nothing they could do for Kathie Durst and that they needed to protect their friend, Robert Durst. Chavin testified that he found it very hard to believe what Berman had told him. I couldnt believe that he would have committed a crime like that, Chavin said. The witness testified that he didnt want to believe Durst had killed his wife. He said he asked Berman how she knew, and said she responded because he told me. The 72-year-old man testified that he was later flabbergasted to learn about Bermans death during a phone conversation with a New York Times reporter who has long covered Durst. He said he was in extreme shock and disbelief after learning later that Durst had dismembered his neighbor, Morris Black, in Galveston, Texas, in 2001, because he believed Durst was not capable of such of hands-on violence. Durst was tried for and eventually acquitted of Blacks killing. Chavin was one of two witnesses that were called to testify early in order for their testimony to be preserved. Prosecutors have suggested that witnesses might be killed. Defense attorneys objected to the early questioning of witnesses, countering that their client is in custody and does not pose any threat to anyone who might testify in his murder case. The murder charge against Durst includes the special circumstance allegations of murder of a witness and murder while lying in wait, along with gun use allegations. Prosecutors, however, are not seeking the death penalty. Durst was arrested March 14, 2015, in a New Orleans hotel room, hours before the airing of the final episode of the HBO documentary series The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst, which examined Kathleen Dursts disappearance and the killings of Berman and Black. He has been long estranged from his real-estate-rich family, known for ownership of a series of New York City skyscrapers -- including an investment in the World Trade Center. Durst split with the family when his younger brother was placed in charge of the family business, leading to a drawn-out legal battle. According to various media reports, Durst ultimately reached a settlement under which the family paid him $60 million to $65 million. -- City News Service, photo courtesy of HBO",0,8,5
183,"- A Beverly Hills man who owned and operated a network of four vocational schools pleaded guilty last week to running a fraud scheme to collect millions of dollars from foreigners who came to the United States on student visas but never studied. Hee Sun Leo Shim, 53, entered his plea Feb. 9 in Los Angeles federal court to felony counts of conspiracy and visa fraud, according to the U.S. Attorneys Office. A June 5 sentencing hearing was set. The enterprise -- which may have generated as much as $6 million a year for Shim and two co-defendants -- involved three schools in Koreatown: Prodee University/Neo-America Language School; Walter Jay M.D. Institute, an Educational Center; and the American College of Forensic Studies; and Likie Fashion and Technology College in Alhambra, authorities said. Shims plea agreement requires him to forfeit property and proceeds derived from the scheme, prosecutors said. The investigation began in 2011 after a compliance team from Homeland Security Investigations Student and Exchange Visitor Program paid an unannounced visit to Prodees main campus on Wilshire Boulevard. During the visit, the team observed only one English language class with three students in attendance, even though immigration records showed more than 900 foreign students were enrolled at the universitys two campuses. That same day, investigators made an unannounced visit to the forensic studies school where they found only one religion class in session with a single student present. At the time, records indicated that the vocational school had more than 300 foreign students in active status. During the ensuing investigation, HSI special agents identified several dozen foreign nationals, primarily from South Korea and China, who originally entered the country as non-immigrant students to attend other authorized schools, but subsequently transferred to schools in the Prodee network. These students lived across the nation, indicating that they were not actually attending classes at Prodee or the other schools. Prosecutors said the conspiracy also involved the creation of bogus student records, including transcripts, for some of the students for the purpose of deceiving immigration authorities. The indictment further alleges that Shim would transfer a purported student -- who would pay as much as $1,800 to enroll for six months -- from one school to another to avoid arousing the suspicion of immigration authorities about students who had been in the United States for lengthy periods of time. Two Los Angeles men have pleaded guilty to federal charges in the case and are awaiting sentencing. Hyung Chan Steve Moon and Eun Young Jamie Choi assisted with the operation and management of the schools, prosecutors said. -- City News Service, photo via Shutterstock",0,8,5
184,"- A Los Angeles federal jury Wednesday rejected a womans $21.5 million lawsuit alleging New York Knicks guard Derrick Rose and two of his friends broke into her apartment and raped her while she was incapacitated three years ago. Roses attorney called the lawsuit a blatant attempt to extract money from the NBA player, while the womans attorney insisted it was a classic case of gang rape. The mostly female jury deliberated for about three hours before reaching its unanimous verdict, exonerating Rose and longtime friends Ryan Allen and Randy Hampton. The woman who filed the lawsuit -- a 30-year-old ex-girlfriend of Rose -- claimed the athlete and his friends conspired to sexually assault her in the pre-dawn hours of Aug. 27, 2013, as she lay passed out. After the verdicts were read, Rose, 28, and his co-defendants embraced their attorneys. The plaintiff turned away, her face hidden behind her long, flowing hair. She left the courthouse without comment. U.S. District Judge Michael Fitzgerald, who presided over the often sordid 10-day trial, wished both sides well, offering Rose luck with the Knicks, except when you play the Lakers. The former NBA Rookie of the Year -- who missed several practices and all but one preseason game during the proceedings -- said the trial was important to him to prove I did not do what I was accused of, even if it meant publicly sharing very private details. The womans attorney, Waukeen McCoy, said outside court that he would consider an appeal, adding that he was bewildered by the verdict. Money wasnt the purpose, he told reporters. The lawsuit alleged trespassing, sexual battery and battery. Although no criminal charges have been filed, the Los Angeles Police Department is conducting an investigation into the womans allegations. In closing arguments Tuesday afternoon, a defense attorney told the eight-person civil jury that the lawsuit was an attempt to get money from Rose because he broke up with the plaintiff by text and didnt seem to care that she had sex with his buddies. The plaintiffs lawyer countered that his client was taken advantage of by Rose and his friends -- whom he called sexual deviants -- while she was either drunk or drugged, and has yet to fully recover. She wants money, Roses lawyer, Mark Baute, told the jury. She was upset with Derrick for ending their relationship. She is not a real rape victim -- she is a liar. A string of witnesses testified in federal court for both sides, and the defendants each told the jury they had been invited to the plaintiffs downtown home for consensual sex, hours after they all had partied together at Roses rented Beverly Hills mansion. Calling the allegations a classic case of gang rape, plaintiffs attorney McCoy insisted his client was not looking for a quick dollar. She is looking for accountability. McCoy asked the panel to hold these men accountable for their actions. By painting the woman as sexually aggressive and inquiring about her sex life, the defense was attempting to slut-shame Roses accuser, he said. Both sides agreed that Rose and the woman were in some kind of relationship for about 20 months prior to the alleged assault. Baute said Rose had broken up with the woman by text in July 2013, leaving her bitter and confused. As the defense tells it, the woman sent Rose a text out of the blue on the morning of Aug. 26, 2013, indicating she was horny. Rose took the bait and invited the woman to party with him in Beverly Hills that night, Baute said, suggesting that the accuser was secretly laying grounds for a rape lawsuit that wouldnt be filed until two years later. The woman and a friend were invited to have a drink with Rose in Beverly Hills that night, the attorneys agreed. But while defense witnesses testified that the plaintiff appeared relatively sober and initiated sex with all three defendants at the gathering that night, the accuser told the jury that no sex ever took place at the party. She said after a couple shots of tequila, she began to feel unusually intoxicated, and a cab was called to take her and her friend to their respective homes. The alleged assault occurred hours after she returned to her apartment, following what the defense claims were dozens of 2 a.m. text messages and phone calls to the defendants allegedly insisting they drive over to see her. The accuser was the shot caller, Baute said, telling the jury that the woman brought the defendants into her apartment and then told them to come to her bedroom one at a time. He said the lawsuit filed in 2015 was an attempt to transfer wealth from Rose and get back at him for ending their relationship. During jury selection, defense attorneys complained about the racial and ethnic makeup of the prospective Los Angeles jury pool, which consisted of only a few blacks. The jury in the case consisted of six women and two men -- all either white or Hispanic. Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek said he didnt expect the former league MVP to rejoin the team until Friday. Rose is expected to have several practices with his teammates before the Knicks season opener Tuesday against the Cleveland Cavaliers. -- City News Service",0,8,5
185,"Police at UCLA today were on the lookout for a man who assaulted someone at a campus facility. The attack took place about 8:30 p.m. Thursday at Ackerman Student Union, according to the UCLA Police Department. The male victim, who is not affiliated with the university, reported that the suspect picked up a metal chair and tried to hit him with it, police said. The suspect also made threats to the victim and used racial slurs against him during the attack, according to a police statement. The victim suffered minor lacerations, police said, but its unclear if they were from the chair. The suspect is described as white, about 40 years old, 5 feet 10 inches tall and heavy set with a large stomach. UCLA police contacted by City News Service would not divulge the ethnicity of the victim or what prompted the attack. His face bore gray stubble, he wore a blue shirt and khaki shorts and had a black backpack, police said. Anyone with information about the suspect was urged to call UCLA police at (310) 825-1491.

186,"By FRED SHUSTER A porn actor was found guilty today of shaking down a wealthy telecom executive, forcing him to turn over $500,000 and a car worth nearly $180,000 so details of his paid sexual liaisons with the defendant and other X-rated performers wouldnt be revealed on social media. A Los Angeles federal jury deliberated about two hours before finding Teo Brank guilty of extortion and related counts stemming from a $1.5 million blackmail attempt on Florida tycoon and political donor Donald Burns. Brank -- who performs under the name Jarec Wentworth in adult films and on gay porn sites -- was arrested in March in an FBI sting after an agent posing as Burns associate met with the actor at a Starbucks in El Segundo and handed over title to an Audi R8 and discussed transfer of $1 million. Weeks earlier, Burns had given Brank $500,000 and the Audi after the male escort and actor threatened to bring your house down by posting on Twitter details of the multi-millionaires paid sexual encounters, evidence showed. Burns, who is partial owner of the Internet phone company Magicjack and controls the Donald A. Burns Foundation, testified during the three-day trial that he paid men for sex to avoid emotional entanglements. Prosecutors said that Brank had a two-year relationship with Burns in which the executive paid him $2,000 per sexual encounter, then asked the actor to introduce him to other male escorts, offering Brank a $2,000 referral for each introduction, and more if he joined in. The defense maintained that Burns groomed and mentored Brank, offering to help him launch a modeling career away from porn but then reneged on the promise and broke off their friendship. At that point, Brank threatened to use Twitter to expose the executives predilection for sex for pay, Assistant U.S. Attorney Eddie Jauregui told jurors. Burns panicked, Jauregui said, and when Brank demanded $500,000 and the Audi to keep quiet, the businessman complied, transferring the money to Branks bank account and delivering the car. Im just going to bite hard, Brank wrote in a text message that was introduced at trial. I want a new car, motorcycle and both hands full of cash. Jauregui said that two weeks later, Brank upped the ante, ordering Burns to hand over $1 million and the Audis certificate of title. At that point, Burns went to the FBI, and Brank was arrested in the Starbucks sting as the Palm Beach-based executive watched on a live video feed at the FBIs Westwood offices. Defense attorney Seema Ahmad, however, told the panel that Brank never threatened Burns reputation because the executive made no secret of his private life and there was nothing to expose. Instead, Brank merely wanted to tell his Twitter followers what happened to him at the hands of Burns. He wanted what was promised him, Ahmad said. The attorney told jurors that Burns paid Brank not because he was worried about his reputation, but because he truly owed Brank the money and car for services rendered. Burns reputation was never threatened, Ahmad said, adding that Brank only asked for the money he deserved. Brank, 25, who lived most recently in Sacramento, could face multiple years in federal prison at the Sept. 21 sentencing hearing. City News Service",0,8,5
187,"Authorities Tuesday sought public help to find a man who attacked a 74-year-old rabbi as he walked on a sidewalk in the Fairfax area. The beating — which was captured on security video — occurred about 8:40 a.m. Monday on Oakwood Avenue west of La Brea Avenue, said Los Angeles police Officer Drake Madison. The attack is not being investigated as a hate crime, Madison said. We believe it was a random act of violence, he said. The security video footage shows the victim being punched repeatedly and falling to the ground. His attacker was described a man in his 40s. The rabbi, whose name was withheld, was treated at the scene but did not require hospitalization. Anyone with information on the crime was urged to call (877) LAPD-247.

188,"A hate crime investigation was underway today following an attack on a black man in West Hollywood, authorities said. The crime occurred about 2:45 a.m. Tuesday after the man got off a bus at Fairfax Avenue and Santa Monica Boulevard, the sheriffs department reported. As he was walking northbound (on Fairfax), crossing Santa Monica Boulevard, he saw a white Audi Q4 facing southbound waiting for him to cross the street, a sheriffs statement said. As he neared the curb, he heard the occupants yell numerous slurs related to his race and sexual orientation, the statement said. Three suspects got out of the car and approached the man, and he was punched in the face, which caused him to fall backward, striking his head, the statement said. The man lost consciousness, and paramedics took him to a hospital. The suspects fled and are being sought. The sheriffs department did not identify the man. According to the Los Angeles Times, the victim was Don Brooks, 31. He told KCBS-TV that he asked the men to leave him alone, but they got out of the car and attacked him. Its like one second I was crossing the street, Brooks said. The next second, I was on the ground bleeding crazily from the back of my head.

189,"A 46-year-old African American UCLA facilities employee arrested on suspicion of obstruction and resisting arrest by campus police last week is accusing the department of racial profiling and violating his civil rights, it was reported today. Claudius E. Gaines III was arrested after being stopped on Strathmore Drive shortly before midnight last Wednesday as he drove home from his shift at the university, the Los Angeles Times reported. His attorney, Carl Douglas, told The Times that officers had no reason to stop the truck. When Gaines questioned why he was being stopped, Douglas said, the officers called for backup and he was threatened with being pepper- sprayed. Gaines, a probationary employee with the facilities department at UCLA, is concerned that the incident could result in his losing his job, Douglas said. The university issued a statement disputing the attorneys account, saying Gaines refused to comply with the officers requests to provide them with his drivers license and proof of registration during the traffic stop. Officers then asked him to get out of the car, a request Mr. Gaines again repeatedly refused, escalating the situation and leading to his arrest for obstructing and resisting an officer, the statement said. The arrest comes after a legal settlement in July with a prominent African American judge over alleged mistreatment and racial profiling by the universitys police officers during a traffic stop. In the settlement, the university agreed to pay $500,000, including $350,000 for scholarships, and to provide additional training to officers. Douglas represented the judge, David Cunningham III, according to The Times. --City News Service  PHOTO Patch file photo credit: Renee Schiavone.",1,0,3
190,"By ELIZABETH MARCELLINO City News Service A Los Angeles judge today denied a request by prosecutors to take Chris Brown into custody because of an alleged violation of the singers probation, ordered as a result of his 2009 assault of then-girlfriend Rihanna. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge James R. Brandlin cited a probation officers report that the 24-year-old singer was doing well in a court-ordered substance-abuse and anger-management program and making great strides. All narcotics tests have come back negative, according to the report, which noted Browns willingness to comply with the conditions of his probation and described him as having a more serious and responsible demeanor. He has completed 191 hours of community labor as of Jan. 30, according to his probation officer. Deputy District Attorney Mary Murray had asked that Brown be taken into custody, saying he had increasingly demonstrated his violent outbursts, and they are increasing in severity and frequency. Brown was arrested in Washington, D.C., last October for allegedly punching a 20-year-old man who was trying to get a photo with Brown. Murray said her office had only recently been able to reach the man  and witnesses to the alleged run-in, and that evidence amounted to a change in circumstances warranting Browns incarceration. But Brandlin disagreed, finding no new information in the case. The judge said he would follow the probation report recommendation that Brown should still remain in the community, adding that the residential rehab program provided an adequate safety net. In addition to a no-drug policy, the program includes cognitive behavioral work, mindfulness training, brain fitness, nutrition and sleep hygiene, according to a letter from the treatment center. However, any negative change in behavior could dramatically change your custodial status, Brandlin warned Brown, reminding him that he has been ordered not to use medical marijuana. Just look at him, said defense attorney Mark Geragos of his client. Ive known him for five years. He looks as good as hes ever been. Clad in a dark blue button-down shirt and dark jeans, Brown sat quietly in the courtroom, flanked by his mother and his on-again, off-again girlfriend, Karreuche Tran. The singers bodyguard, Christopher Hollosy -- who along with Brown is charged with a misdemeanor count of assault in the  Washington, D.C. incident -- sat in the row behind him. Browns next scheduled appearance in Washington, D.C., is on Feb. 20, when the goal will be to set a trial date, according to Geragos. A police report dated Oct. 28 in that case says Browns bodyguard was taking a photo of the singer and two fans when Parker Adams moved in and tried to take a picture of himself with (Brown) and the other two. Brown allegedly said to Adams, Im not wit that gay (expletive), and told him, I feel like boxing before landing a punch. One of the two fans alleged that she witnessed Brown punching Adams. Her friend said the bodyguard then punched Adams, an allegation to which the bodyguard admitted, saying he was just doing his job. Brown himself denied he had a confrontation with Adams, telling police, I was on the (tour) bus when I guess someone tried to get on and my bodyguard handled it. He and Hollosy declined plea deals at a Jan. 8 hearing on the matter. Brown pleaded guilty in June 2009 to assault by means likely to produce great bodily injury for assaulting Rihanna during an argument that began about 12:30 a.m. on Feb. 8, 2009, while the singers were in a rented Lamborghini in Hancock Park after attending a pre-Grammy Awards party. Brown was sentenced to five years probation, a yearlong domestic violence program -- which he completed -- and 180 days of community labor. Browns probation was first revoked over the summer after he was charged with a pair of misdemeanors and an infraction stemming from a May 21 traffic crash in Toluca Lake. Those charges have since been dismissed, despite a city prosecutors objection to a civil compromise in which attorneys said no money was exchanged between the parties. His probation was then reinstated last August, when Brandlin ordered the singer to perform an additional 1,000 hours of community labor.    Brown is due back in Los Angeles Superior Court on Feb. 28, when a date will be set for a hearing on the alleged probation violation.",0,8,5
191,"Laws to protect Californians from DUI offenders, help establish an earthquake early warning system, reform the California Public Utilities Commission, increase oversight of building contractors, require police to securely stow any handgun left in a car, improve tour bus safety, crack down on water-guzzling households, and more take effect on January 1. The new laws are the result of 17 bills that were introduced by Senator Jerry Hill, passed by the Legislature and signed by Governor Jerry Brown in 2016. Here are summaries of the bills that led to the new laws and what they do: Senate Bill 24 – JPA Pension Fix for San Mateo County Resolves a pension problem that prevented the cities of San Mateo, Belmont and Foster City from completing their Joint Powers Agreement for shared fire service. It allows the three cities to provide the JPA employees a defined benefit plan that those employees received as classic CalPERS members from their previous employment with the cities. San Mateo County Firefighters and the California Professional Firefighters supported SB 24, along with the cities of San Mateo, Belmont and Foster City. SB 62 – California Public Utilities Commission Office of the Safety Advocate Establishes the Office of the Safety Advocate within the California Public Utilities Commission to advocate for continuous, cost-effective improvement of safety management and safety performance of public utilities. SB 438 – Earthquake Early Warning Implementation Complements the $10 million included in the 2016-2017 budget for the statewide earthquake early warning system by establishing the Earthquake Early Warning Advisory Board within the Governors Office of Emergency Services. The new law brings California closer to statewide implementation of the earthquake early warning system. In emergencies, the alerts sent by the warning system will help prevent devastating and life-threatening missteps. Governor Browns announcement of his signing the bill is here and view video of the press conference held at the Office of Emergency Services headquarters here. SB 465 – Building Construction Contractors: Discipline, Reporting and Building Standards SB 465 is aimed at increasing oversight of contractors by closing the gaps in information that were revealed by the collapse of a balcony at a Berkeley apartment building on June 16, 2015. Ashley Donohoe, 22, of Rohnert Park, her cousin, Olivia Burke, 21, of Ireland, and four of their friends were killed. Seven other students from Ireland, including Aoife Beary who had been celebrating her 21st birthday, were hospitalized for weeks after the balcony gave way and sent them plummeting five stories to the ground. Aoife Beary, her mother Angela, Ashley Donohoes mother, Jackie, and representatives of the Irish Consulate testified to policy committees in the Capitol about the devastating loss felt by families from California to Ireland – and urged legislators to support SB 465, which was co-authored by Senator Loni Hancock, D-Oakland. The new law: SB 512 – Governance, Accountability and Transparency at the California Public Utilities Commission SB 512 reforms the governance structure of the California Public Utilities Commission by more clearly outlining the roles and responsibilities of commissioners and staff, and by requiring the CPUC to reach out to communities affected by CPUC decisions, instead of only to regulated utilities. To do so, SB 512 makes the following statutory changes: It 1) requires the commission to annually approve performance criteria for the commission and the executive director, and to annually evaluate the performance of the executive director based on those criteria; 2) requires the CPUC to reach out to those affected by its proceedings; 3) requires CPUC judges to adhere to ethics provisions of the Administrative Procedures Act; 4) allows the public to receive hearing transcripts at no charge; 5) permits the CPUC to meet in locations other than San Francisco; 6) requires the CPUC to modify its annual report to clarify how long the CPUC takes to finish rate or penalty cases; and 7) allows local governments to receive intervenor compensation when participating in CPUC efforts to improve safety, enabling local governments that have suffered catastrophes to seek such compensation. SB 661 – The Dig Safe Act of 2016 SB 661 addresses safety problems involving excavations and gas pipelines that are beneath soil or are otherwise underground by making clarifications to the so-called one-call law (Call 811 before you dig) and by creating the Safe Excavation Board, an appointed board of excavation stakeholders that is funded by fees on utilities. The board is to 1) investigate accidents and other one-call violations; 2) develop standards for safe excavation; and 3) coordinate education and outreach efforts. SB 812 – Improving Tour Bus Safety Improves the safety and oversight of tour buses operating in California by strengthening the California Highway Patrols tour bus inspection program. The law was prompted by a tour bus accident in San Franciscos Union Square in November 2015 that injured 20 people, at least five critically. After the crash, the CHP determined that the bus had never been inspected and was not registered with the California Public Utilities Commission, as is required by law. The CHP later conducted a surprise inspection of the companys bus fleet and found over 60 violations, 29 for mechanical problems. SB 814 – Cracking Down on Water-Guzzling Households During a Drought A winner of Senator Hills 2016 Oughta Be a Law…Or Not bill idea contest for constituents, SB 814 pulls the plug on excessive water use by households that flout mandatory reductions during drought emergencies. The law requires urban retail water suppliers to set rules for identifying and cracking down on households that consume enormous amounts of water despite restrictions imposed during a statewide declaration of a drought. The new law ensures that every urban retail water supplier has a tool to curb excessive water use by customers. Households that guzzle water – while neighbors and most other Californians abide by mandatory reductions – will no longer be able to hide and persist in their excess. SB 869 – Safe Storage of Police Handguns in Vehicles Another winner of Senator Hills 2016 Oughta Be a Law… contest, SB 869 responds to numerous thefts of handguns that law enforcement officers had left in cars. The stolen firearms included guns used in two murders in the Bay Area. SB 869 closes a legal loophole that had exempted law enforcement officers as well as concealed weapons permit holders from requirements to securely stow handguns in a lockbox out of plain view, or in the trunk, if the weapons are left in an unattended vehicle. SB 996 – Affordable Housing Property Tax Cap Aids local nonprofit and religious organizations that provide affordable housing by increasing the assessed property value exemption from $2,000,000 annually to $10,000,000 annually. The new law applies to three local nonprofits, such as the Saint Francis Center in Redwood City and the Ministry Services of the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul based in Los Altos Hills, which provides housing, food and clothing services to low-income families. SB 996 provides property tax relief to such organizations so that they can continue to provide more affordable housing for low income people and families. SB 1004 – Young Adult Offender Pilot Program Hailed by Governor Brown for its innovation, SB 1004 authorizes a pilot program in five counties, including Santa Clara, to give nonviolent young adult offenders between the ages of 18 and 21 the opportunity to take advantage of supportive and educational services in the juvenile justice system, rather than serve their time in an adult county jail. Although legally considered adults, these young offenders are still undergoing significant brain development, and may be better served by the juvenile justice system with age-appropriate, intensive services. Research shows that people do not develop adult-caliber, decision-making skills until their early 20s. Psychologists note that this maturity gap makes young adults more likely to engage in risk-seeking behavior. SB 1028 – Utility Wildfire Mitigation Plans SB 1028 requires 1) utilities regulated by the California Public Utilities Commission to file wildfire mitigation plans, 2) the CPUC to review those plans, and 3) publicly-owned utilities to also file wildfire mitigation plans with their governing boards. SB 1039 – Business and Professions Omnibus Bill SB 1039 makes several changes to the statutes governing various boards and bureaus under the Department of Consumer Affairs; includes specified fee increases for several boards including the Dental Hygiene Committee of California, the California Board of Optometry, the Board of Registered Nursing, the Board of Pharmacy, and the Contractors State License Board; and eliminates the Telephone Medical Advice Services Bureau. SB 1039 specifies that the continuing education standards established for nurses by the Board of Registered Nursing shall recognize specialized areas of practice, as previously required, and require that content be relevant to the practice of nursing, be related to the scientific knowledge or technical skills required for the practice of nursing, or be related to direct or indirect patient or client care. The legislation requires the nursing board to audit continuing education providers at least once every five years to ensure adherence to regulatory requirements. The new law also requires the board to withhold or rescind approval from any provider that is in violation of the regulatory requirements. SB 1046 – Ignition Interlock Devices for Drunk Driving Offenders Extends a pilot program requiring drunk driving offenders in Alameda, Los Angeles, Sacramento and Tulare counties to install the devices known as IIDs. IIDs are calibrated to the driver and prevent a car from starting if the driver is not sober. The four-county pilot would run until January 1, 2019, when the program would be expanded statewide with minor modifications so that: SB 1046 also creates an early incentive program, providing DUI offenders with full driving privileges soon after arrest if they install an IID. Their ultimate IID time requirement would be reduced based on when the early installation occurred. Low income offenders would be eligible for assistance to pay for an IID based on a sliding scale pegged to household income. SB 1192 – Private Post-Secondary Education SB 1192 changes the California Private Post-Secondary Education Act of 2009 to improve the effectiveness of the Bureau for Private Post-Secondary Education and opportunities for student success, and extends the BPPEs operations for four years. SB 1193 – Healing Arts, Board of Pharmacy, Veterinary Medical Board Sunset Bill SB 1193 makes changes to the Pharmacy Law, Veterinary Practice Act and Psychology Licensing Law to strengthen the laws and improve oversight of licensees by these boards. SB 1196 – Professions and Vocations: Bureau of Real Estate, Bureau of Real Estate Appraisers, and Bureau of Security and Investigative Services Bill SB 1196 ensures that the Bureau of Security and Investigative Services is subject to review by the appropriate policy committees of the Legislature. The legislation changes provisions in the Alarm Company Act, the Locksmith Act, the Private Investigator Act, the Private Security Services Act, Proprietary Security Services Act, and Collateral Recovery Act to improve the oversight, enforcement and regulation of licensees by the bureau. The bill also adds a sunset review date for the Bureau of Real Estate and the Bureau of Real Estate Appraisers, and changes existing laws to improve oversight, enforcement and regulation by the CalBRE and BREA. SB 1196 includes several consumer protection and public safety reforms to operations and oversight by the Bureau of Security and Investigative Services, which licenses about 380,000 companies and employees that provide alarm services, locksmith services, private investigation, private security, repossession services and firearm and baton training. The changes are intended to ensure that an applicant for licensure as an armed security guard is capable of exercising appropriate judgment, restraint and self-control; that armed security guards are qualified for their jobs, and that California regulators step up their policing of the industry. SB 1196 also imposes stricter training standards and requirements to ensure that shootings and incidents of suspected excessive force are investigated. In addition, the new law enables gun permits to be revoked when warranted and improves oversight of companies. – SUBMITTED FOR PUBLICATION BY: Office of State Senator Jerry Hill / Image via Shutterstock",0,8,5
192,"By BRENDAN KRISEL (Patch Staff) A gunman, who opened fire Thursday at a rural Oregon community college killing at least 10 people, was from the South Bay, and his father still lives in Tarzana. Police identified the shooter as Chris Harper Mercer, a 26-year-old Oregon resident. According to The Los Angeles Times, he formerly lived in Torrance with his mother. His father is a resident of Tarzana, according to the newspaper. A nearby hospital activated disaster level response procedures after reports that up to 20 others were wounded. The shooting took place at Umpqua Community College in the southwest part of the state. News reports conflicted on the number of dead. Kourtney Moore, 18, was in the classroom that the shooter targeted. She told the News-Review Today, that she saw her teacher get shot in the head. Then the gunman entered the classroom and ordered everyone onto the ground. Later, the shooter asked people to stand up and state their religion before he started firing. Brady Winder, 23, was in the room next door when the shooting started. They left like ants, people screaming, Get out! Winder told the News-Review Today. CNN quoted the father of shooting victim Anastasia Boylan, who spoke to her father before going into surgery for a gunshot wound to the back. She described the gunman asking Christians to stand up before shooting them. And they would stand up and he said, Good, because youre a Christian, youre going to see God in just about one second, Boylans father, Stacy, told CNN, relaying her account. And then he shot and killed them. He engaged in a shootout with law enforcement and was killed, said Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin during a press conference. Hanlin said that the shooting was a huge shock, to the small community of Roseburg, Oregon. My heart is heavy as details of todays shooting become available, Gov. Kate Brown said earlier in a statement. While it is still too early to know all of the facts, the effects of an incident such as this one are long-lasting. Please join me in keeping the victims and their families, as well as first responders, in your thoughts. President Barack Obama, in an impassioned speech Thursday night, made arguably his most pointed remarks yet about the need for stricter gun laws. This is a political choice that we make to allow this to happen every few months in America, Obama said. We collectively are answerable to those families who lose their loved ones because of our inaction. You can see video of his full remarks below:",1,3,0
193,"Reported hate crimes in Los Angeles County increased by 15 percent in 2011 from the previous year, with the highest rate in the San Fernando Valley. However, the total is the second lowest in 22 years, according to the county Commission on Human Relations annual report released Wednesday. The commission defines a hate crime as one where hatred or prejudice toward a victims race or ethnicity, religion, disability, gender or sexual orientation was a substantial factor in the crime. According to the 2011 Hate Crime Report, there were 489 reported hate crimes countywide last year, an increase of 62 from the previous year. In April of 2011, targeting African Americans were spray-painted around the campus of Calabasas High School. Three boys were booked on felony vandalism charges, but were ultimately not charged with hate crimes. The vandalism at the school was however one the biggest headline-grabbing events in the county in relation to anti-Semitism in 2011. Nearby Northridge was also the location of another hate-related incident— although it was not included in the report because it occurred in 2012— when three middle school girls, aided by one of their mothers, smeared syrup swastikas and human feces at the home of the son of an holocaust survivor. There are real victims -- these are our friends, family and neighbors, said commission Executive Director Robin Toma. About 50 percent of the crimes were race-based, with 60 percent of those targeting blacks. The report showed that 65 percent of racially motivated crimes against blacks were committed by Latinos, and 41 percent of racially motivated crimes targeting Latinos were committed by blacks. Crimes based on sexual orientation remained at about the same level as the previous year -- 25 percent of all of the hate crimes -- but were more likely to be violent than either racial- or religious-related hated crimes. Religious crimes, which were primarily anti-Semitic in nature, rose 24 percent. It is disturbing that reported hate crimes in Los Angeles County are once again increasing after several years of decline, said Amanda Susskind, regional director of the Anti-Defamation League, a civil rights group with a focus on documenting and fighting anti-Semitism. The highest rate of hate crimes took place in the San Fernando Valley, followed by the metro region stretching from West Hollywood to Boyle Heights. The Antelope Valley and the southeastern portion of the county had the lowest rates. The commissions report was generated from data collected from sheriff and city police departments, school districts and community groups.

194,"A Sunnyvale man accused of killing his co-worker in Santa Claras Central Park earlier this month made his first court appearance today in the Santa Clara County Hall of Justice. Gage McCartney, 25, represented by Deputy Public Defender Matt Wilson, was arraigned on one count of murder and will remain in custody without bail. He did not enter a plea. McCartney and the victim, Raynard Hyde, 54, of Campbell, both worked at a Safeway on 2760 Homestead Road, according to Santa Clara police. On the night of July 19, Hyde clocked out of work at 9 p.m. and met McCartney at a McDonalds at 3509 Homestead Road a couple hours later to eat dinner and drink alcohol, police said. The two men went back to Safeway at about 11 p.m. to buy more alcohol. Surveillance video showed the two men dancing, intoxicated and in good spirits, according to police. The men then went across the street to Central Park in Hydes car. In a statement of facts, police said McCartney told officers that Hyde made unwanted sexual advances toward him at the park. According to police, McCartney said he pushed Hyde away and punched him twice in the face when Hyde allegedly tried to kiss him. McCartney said he then put his hands around Hydes neck and squeezed, making the victim fall to the ground. McCartney thought Hyde had become unconscious, and left the park furious over Hydes alleged sexual advances, police said. McCartney allegedly demonstrated to investigators how he choked the victim, and explained that instinct took over when he attacked Hyde. Police were initially investigating Hydes death as suspicious, but the Santa Clara County medical examiners office later ruled it a homicide by strangulation. McCartney was arrested last Tuesday and was booked in the Santa Clara County Main Jail without bail. McCartneys suggestion that he attacked Hyde because of unwanted sexual advances invokes the gay panic defense, which was banned in California in 2014. Only two other states, Illinois and Rhode Island, have also implemented the ban. DArcy Kemnitz, executive director of the National LGBT Bar Association, could not comment on the specifics of McCartneys case, but said the gay panic defense has led to light sentences after suspects committed brutal attacks in states where the defense is not banned. It is unconscionable and unfair to the victim to bring up whether or not they are gay or not gay, Kemnitz said. Otherwise it turns into, Did the victim bring it upon themselves? Were they asking for it? Deputy District Attorney Alaleh Kianerci said outside of court that detectives are still investigating the motive for McCartneys alleged homicide, but noted the gay panic defense can still be used in a limited capacity despite the 2014 ban. The gay panic defense can no longer reduce a murder charge to involuntary manslaughter by claiming the murder was a heat of passion act, according to Kianerci. However, attorneys can still consider the claim -- if it is backed by reliable evidence -- to determine if the victim was provoked. Kianerci added that there is currently no indication of race-based motivation for the homicide. A Safeway spokeswoman said last week that the store is cooperating with police in their investigation. We mourn the unexpected loss of Ray Hyde. We send our deepest and heartfelt condolences to Rays family, friends, and co-workers. Our team at the Homestead store will miss seeing him at work, spokeswoman Wendy Gutshall said in a statement. Ramone Hyde, the victims brother, shared the news of Hydes death on Facebook last week, saying Hyde loved his family and God, loved to laugh and was the absolute best big brother ever. Hyde attended the Cathedral of Faith in San Jose, according to the church, and many remarked on Hydes faith in God and the religious songs he would sing. Others said Hyde was a beautiful person and a joy to have known. Judge Arthur Bocanegra set McCartneys plea hearing for Sept. 25 at the Santa Clara County Hall of Justice.

195,"Five men who claim they were unfairly targeted by San Jose police in a gay sting operation have sued the city, Chief Edgardo Garcia and seven officers in federal court for allegedly violating their constitutional rights. According to the lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in San Jose on Nov. 8, the five men were each arrested in or near the citys Columbus Park in 2014 and 2015 after undercover officers posing as gay men asked them to engage in sex in a public restroom. They were charged in Santa Clara County Superior Court with the misdemeanor of loitering near a public restroom for the purpose of engaging in or soliciting lewd acts. In 2016, the criminal charges were dismissed by Superior Court Judge Jose Franco, who said that targeting gay men and while ignoring similar conduct by heterosexuals was discriminatory. The federal civil lawsuit alleges that police violated the mens constitutional Fourth Amendment right to be free of unreasonable seizure and their Fourteenth Amendment right to equal treatment. It asks for financial compensation as well as an injunction barring San Jose police from targeting, harassing or arresting men who seek non-monetary intimate association with members of the same sex. Representatives of the San Jose Police Department and City Attorneys Office were not immediately available for comment. By Bay City News Service Image via Shutterstock",1,4,3
196,"- Johnny Monoxide Ramondetta, a Berkeley resident and podcast host who was scheduled to speak at last weekends Unite the Right rally in Virginia, is no longer employed by an electrical contractor with offices in San Francisco and San Jose. Ramondetta was listed as a featured speaker on several fliers for the rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, which turned deadly Saturday when a man allegedly drove a car into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing a woman and injuring 19 other people. Other speakers listed on the fliers were noted white nationalist Richard Spencer and Baked Alaska, an internet commentator who appeared at a rally in Berkeley in April after the cancellation of a speaking event with conservative commentator Ann Coulter. Ramondetta was also the subject of an extensive profile published by the hate group watchdog Southern Poverty Law Center, claiming that hes developed a niche amongst conspiracy theorists and occult enthusiasts with neo-Nazi political and social views. An employee at Rosendin Electrics San Francisco office confirmed on Tuesday that Ramondetta worked there, but a company spokesperson called back Wednesday to clarify that John Ramondetta is no longer employed with Rosendin. The spokesperson declined to comment any further but Ramondettas union, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 6, released a statement Monday saying the views and opinions expressed by Ramondetta do not represent the views of the union. IBEW Local Union No. 6 condemns the violence and murder that took place this past weekend in Charlottesvile, VA. To be perfectly clear, IBEW Local Union No. 6 also condemns white nationalism and white supremacy, as they are in stark conflict with the express goals of our organization, union business manager and financial secretary John Doherty said in a statement. The Unite the Right event, and the actions that were perpetrated by those in attendance, are disgraceful examples of a small minority of bigots that seek to exploit the growing economic desperation of law abiding Americans, Doherty said. The union hosted an immigrant justice workshop sponsored by the SF Electrical Workers Minority Caucus and the Labor Center for Immigrant Justice in their auditorium on Fillmore Street Tuesday evening. A name-and-shame poster featuring a number of epithet-laced quotes that purportedly came from Ramondettas podcasts was circulated in a public post in the Facebook group Brotherhood in the Bay, where he was broadly condemned by fellow union members. Ramondetta did not respond to a Facebook message asking him to confirm his presence at Unite the Right or comment on the statement issued by his union.

197,"SAN JOSE - Police released video Thursday of a suspect wanted for a November stabbing outside a bar in San Joses Willow Glen neighborhood. The suspect and victim bumped into each other at Willow Den Bar located at 803 Lincoln Ave. around 1 a.m. on Nov. 15, police Sgt. Enrique Garcia said. The suspect confronted the victim and ended up in an argument that continued outside on a sidewalk before the dispute escalated into a fight, Garcia said. The suspect pulled out a knife and stabbed the victim at least once before he fled, according to Garcia. The victim was treated at a hospital, Garcia said. Police released a nearly three-minute video of the incident from the bars security camera. In the video, security guards are seen trying to split up the suspect and victim, who walk away from the business and exchange words while walking on the street. The video ends as the suspect is seen chasing down the victim on the road. The suspect is described as a Hispanic man between 25 and 30 years old, standing about 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighing around 180 pounds with a scar either on the back or top of his head, Garcia said. The alleged stabber wore a white T-shirt, blue True Religion jeans and white shoes, according to Garcia.

198,"PALO ALTO - Palo Alto police say they have arrested a man after determining that he falsely reported being stabbed in a downtown Palo Alto parking garage last summer in a case that was originally investigated as a hate crime. According to a department release, on Wednesday, July 15, 2015, the Palo Alto dispatch center received a call from personnel at a local hospital, reporting that they were treating a patient for a stab wound sustained an hour earlier in downtown Palo Alto. The alleged victim, now identified as 19-year-old Jesus Francisco Cabrera of East Palo Alto, told police that he had been accosted in City Parking Garage S at 445 Bryant Street by three white men in their twenties who made disparaging remarks about Cabreras ethnicity. According to Cabrera, the three men allegedly then attacked him, and Cabrera received a moderate puncture wound to his thigh that he claimed had been caused from being stabbed by a screwdriver. The supposed suspects fled the scene on foot, while Cabrera drove himself to the hospital. He was treated and released that night for his injuries. Police say that due to the nature of Cabreras initial statement, detectives immediately began investigating the case as a hate crime. Palo Alto PD distributed a news release on July 17 about the alleged hate crime, which included sketches of two of the supposed suspects produced by a police artist who met with Cabrera. The reported crime received attention in the local media and from the Citys Human Relations Commission, who asked police personnel to make a presentation on hate crimes in Palo Alto as a result of the case. Since July, detectives say they have continued investigating this case, and identified a number of inconsistencies in Cabreras statements. The completed investigation revealed that Cabrera had actually sustained the stab wound during a mutual combat fight with known acquaintances that had occurred in East Palo Alto and that arose after a dispute over graffiti. No hate crime or stabbing occurred in downtown Palo Alto, say police. Detectives presented the case to the Santa Clara County District Attorneys Office, who filed a charge of one misdemeanor count of falsely reporting a crime against Cabrera. A judge signed an arrest warrant last week. Detectives summoned Cabrera to the police station on Friday, January 8, arrested him pursuant to the warrant, and booked him into the Santa Clara County Main Jail. Anyone with information about this incident is asked to call the Palo Alto Police 24-hour dispatch center at 650-329-2413.

199,"By Bay City News Service A manifesto recovered on a Santa Clara resident and University of California at Merced student who stabbed four people at the San Joaquin Valley campus Wednesday detailed his plan of attack, according to the Merced County Sheriffs Department. Sheriff Vern Warnke was notified Thursday afternoon of the two-page manifesto found on 18-year-old Faisal Mohammad during an autopsy examination, sheriffs Sgt. Delray Shelton said. He had gotten kicked out of a study group and was upset with one of the students, and he took his anger to the extreme level, Warnke said in a statement Friday. It was well scripted as to what he was going to say as things progressed through the planned attack, Shelton said. UC Merced officials said Mohammad entered a classroom on campus shortly after 8 a.m. Wednesday and stabbed four people: two students, a staff member and a contractor. The injured are expected to survive their injuries, school officials said. The room had about 15 students inside taking a general education class required for freshmen students that Mohammad was enrolled in, according to UC Merced Chancellor Dorothy Leland said. The 18-year-old freshman, who majored in computer science and engineering, planned to bind students with zip ties, cover the floor with petroleum jelly to obstruct emergency crews, take an officers gun and carry out other plans at the schools residence halls, school officials said. He first stabbed two people before students started to intervene and he ran away, only to be stopped by a construction worker, according to school officials. Mohammad stabbed the worker and a staff member before he was fatally shot by campus police, according to school officials. The plan went haywire because people fought back -- that was (Mohammads) bad luck, Warnke said. We have some very brave students and a brave construction worker that stopped this from going on, the sheriff said. Bomb squads searched Mohammads backpack and found handcuffs, zip ties, two clear bags of petroleum jelly, a single-lens night-vision scope, a safety hammer that can be used to break windows and two rolls of duct tape, according to Warnke. In his dorm investigators found a handwritten list of all the items found inside the backpack. The list included a pair of scissors, which was not found, according to Warnke. There were names listed in the manifesto, but its unclear if they were placeholders or of actual people, according to Shelton. UC Merced police is investigating the stabbings with the sheriffs department and FBI. The sheriffs department will oversee the investigation into the officer-involved shooting. The manifesto had some prayers and there some words praising and asking for help from Allah, Shelton said. There is no indication that Mohammad had any political, religious or terrorist motivations and was driven by personal animosities, Leland said. A background check by the FBI into Mohammad and his family from the Santa Clara area found nothing concerning, Warnke said. Mohammad graduated from Adrian Wilcox High School in June, Santa Clara Unified School District spokeswoman Jennifer Dericco said. The district is providing counselors for students at the school to help provide support following Mohammads death, Dericco said. In a statement Friday to the campus community Leland said, It is important that we remind ourselves and one another that the events of Nov. 4, 2015, will not define us. As we try to make sense of these events as a community, I urge all of us to practice kindness and offer our support and understanding to each other and all our fellow UC Merced community members as we heal these wounds, she said. The campus reopened at 8 a.m. Friday for normal operations. A candlelight vigil organized by the Associated Students of UC Merced is planned Friday at 5 p.m. An online fundraising page has been set up by the student organization to alleviate medical expenses for the stabbing victims.

200,"The Santa Cruz Mission was vandalized earlier this week with a message mentioning a recently canonized saint, and the incident is being investigated as a hate crime, a police spokeswoman said today. Around 7 a.m. Monday, police received a call from mission staff member who found red paint splattered at the missions front wooden doors and a side wall spray painted in red with the message Serra St. of Genocide, police spokeswoman Joyce Blaschke said. The message makes a reference to Junipero Serra, an 18th-century missionary who was canonized by Pope Francis in September. The mission, located on School Street between High and Mission streets, was founded by Franciscans in 1791, according to the state parks website. Damage from the vandalism is estimated at about $5,000, Blaschke said. The mission is located next door to Holy Cross School, a private Catholic school for students in preschool through eighth grade. Police are looking for surveillance footage from the surrounding area that can provide clues on the suspect or suspects, according to Blaschke. Investigators are looking into whether the incident is related to one in Carmel-by-the-Sea in September, when a statue of Serra was vandalized at the San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo Mission days after his canonization, police said. The statues and graves of people of European descent at the mission were also vandalized, but not those of Native Americans, according to police.

201,"Oakland police are helping to develop a training program on implicit racial bias and procedural justice as part of a California Department of Justice effort to address the current crisis of confidence in law enforcement, California Attorney General Kamala Harris announced Friday. The training program, which is being developed with the Stockton Police Departments and Stanford University Professor Jennifer L. Eberhardt, among others, was one of the actions announced following an internal state Department of Justice review of its existing training on the use of force and implicit bias. It will be certified by the Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training, according to state officials. The 90-day review, conducted by the Department of Justices Division of Law Enforcement, also developed policies on implicit bias and racial profiling and created a 21st Century Policing Working Group to foster further discussion. Speaking at an event in Los Angeles, Harris said she hopes the review can be used as a blueprint for police and sheriffs departments throughout the state to critically examine their existing policies and draft recommendations that are appropriate for the communities they serve. Speakers at the event cited the success of Oaklands Operation Ceasefire, a community-based effort to reduce violence and recidivism, as an example for other communities. As a result of the review, the Department of Justice is adopting bodyworn cameras for all special agents conducting field operations and plans to institute new policies on the technologys use. The department is also planning to train all special agents on fair and impartial policing practices and implicit biases by the end of May, officials said.

203,"A reputed Mexican Mafia member who is also head of a San Gabriel Valley gang that targeted black victims is expected to be sentenced today to at least 10 years in federal prison. James Chemo Gutierrez, 53, pleaded guilty in April to three conspiracy counts involving racketeering, narcotics distribution and money laundering, according to court documents. Gutierrez, leader of the El Monte Flores gang, faces between 10 years to life in federal prison when he is sentenced by U.S. District Judge John A. Kronstadt, court papers show. He was the lead defendant in a 41-person federal indictment detailing allegations of murder, kidnapping, drug trafficking, robbery, burglary, carjacking, witness intimidation and other offenses. The gang often committed hate crimes directed against African- Americans who might reside or be present in the cities of El Monte and South El Monte in an effort to rid these cities of all African-Americans, according to the 62-count indictment. Other gang-related crimes outlined in the 2014 document include the execution of a former Mexican Mafia member and the fatal shooting of four others in an El Monte home in 1995. The indictment also describes an ongoing dispute involving members of the Mexican Mafia who are attempting to exercise control over the gang. Gutierrez is currently in federal custody after his supervised release was revoked following a 20-year sentence in a federal homicide case. Other Mexican Mafia members serving life prison terms are not charged in the indictment, but they are listed as co-conspirators. The gang maintained a significant presence at the Boys & Girls Club in San Gabriel, where gang members openly sold drugs, held gang meetings and even held a car wash fundraiser, according to the indictment.Members of the gang also regularly used and threatened to use violence to extort taxes from local drug dealers and fraudulent document vendors, the indictment says. Prosecutors further alleged several incidents dating back to early 2001 in which black victims in El Monte were attacked, threatened and subjected to racial epithets. --City News Service/Shutterstock image",1,0,0

205,"Twenty years ago this week, the world learned of a formerly obscure religious cult and its macabre final act, a mass suicide in a rented Rancho Santa Fe mansion. On the afternoon of March 26, 1997, sheriffs deputies responding to an emergency call found the bodies of 39 people on cots and mattresses throughout a 9,000-square-foot Mediterranean-style home in the 18000 block of Colina Norte, just northwest of San Dieguito Reservoir. All the deceased were dressed in black, including new Nike running shoes, and most had purple shrouds covering their upper bodies. As news crews from around the globe swarmed over the secluded neighborhood, investigators determined that the dead were members of Heavens Gate, a religious group with beliefs centering on extraterrestrials and space travel. They had killed themselves over a three-day period by ingesting phenobarbital mixed with applesauce and washed down with vodka. Among the bodies was that of the cults leader, 65-year-old Marshall Applewhite. He left behind a videotaped message in which he described the fringe sects self-sacrifice as a final exit that would transport its members to a spacecraft tailing Comet Hale-Bopp, then passing by the Earth, to begin a journey to heaven.  As part of their preparations for death, all the participants in the mass suicide also recorded videotapes in which they bade farewell to loved ones and praised Applewhite, whom they referred to as Do (pronounced doe). An ex-Heavens Gate member who received a message from members of the cult explaining their plans to do away with themselves discovered the bodies after traveling from his Beverly Hills home to the Rancho Santa Fe manor. He then left and made a call from a pay phone in Carlsbad to anonymously report the deaths. Several months after the mass suicides, community leaders changed the name of the road where it had occurred to Paseo Victoria. Neighbors eventually banded together to buy the notorious mansion and had it demolished. By City News Service / Image via YouTube screen capture",0,8,5
206,"An investigation was underway Wednesday into whether a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement supervisor, while on the job, solicited subordinates at their downtown San Diego office to attend swinger parties, it was reported. A complaint to the Inspector General for the Department of Homeland Security made earlier this year detailed the supervisors alleged efforts to recruit employees for sex parties at his home, according to the San Diego Union- Tribune. The complaint has since been referred to the Office of Professional Responsibility, which investigates employee misconduct accusations. Federal employees alleged the supervisor abused his authority when he approached them during work hours at the Enforcement and Removal Operations office to coerce them into attending the parties, which were held at the home he shared with his wife -- also an ICE agent -- while their children were home, but not in the room, the Union-Tribune reported. Requests were also made via text message. The complaint alleged that rookie employees agreed to participate because they were intimidated or believed it would help them get promoted. The accusations of gross sexual misconduct came as the number of complaints involving the San Diego office were increasing. Previous complaints allege employees have been subjected to racial slurs, discrimination and retaliation. In the past fiscal year, 13 Equal Employment Opportunity complaints were filed from the San Diego office, the Union-Tribune reported. --City News Service",0,8,5
207,"A man who on the Fourth of July drove his SUV onto the sand at Mission Beach while drunk, injuring several people, was sentenced today to a year in jail and ordered to abstain from alcohol during five years on probation. Villiami Pomale, 45, pleaded guilty earlier this month to felony assault with a deadly weapon, DUI and misdemeanor reckless driving. Judge Polly Shamoon suspended a five-year prison sentence, meaning Pomale could be sent there if he violates any terms of probation, including drug treatment. The judge told the defendant it was nothing short of a miracle that no one was killed during his reckless and dangerous actions. Deputy District Attorney Karra Reedy echoed the judges comments, noting Pomale endangered the lives of a number of victims that day. This was a man who drove on the beach on one of the four busiest holidays of the year, the prosecutor said. He endangered the lives of hundreds, if not thousands of people. He was aggressive in each and every circumstance where he left a victim in his trail. He had multiple times that he could stop. People tried to confront him and actually force him to stop. He kept going. Defense attorney Joshua Bourne said Pomales actions were completely out of character for the deeply religious family man. Pomale -- an admitted alcoholic -- apologized to the victims and the citizens of San Diego for what happened. The defendant, who lives in Northern California, was in San Diego July 4th visiting family and barbecuing before the incident happened.  This was a shock to his family, and his friends, and his co-workers, Bourne said outside court. According to the prosecutor, Pomale clipped a skateboarder and hit a pole on Mission Boulevard about 6 p.m. on Independence Day. Witnesses confronted the defendant, but he sped off onto the beach, running over a persons towel and causing a number of people to jump out of the way. Pomale then rear-ended a car and cursed at a passenger who got out of the vehicle, Reedy said. She said an off-duty police officer yelled at the parties to exchange information, but Pomale drove off and brushed against the officer, hitting his arm and causing him to drop his cell phone. Reedy said the defendant hit four people, and noted there were thousands of people on the beach that day. The prosecutor said Pomale was driving 40 to 50 mph. Pomales blood-alcohol content was measured at .16 and .18 percent, Bourne said. --City News Service",0,8,5
208,"An international investigation was underway Tuesday into the mystery surrounding a late-stage cancer victim who turned up in Carlsbad five months ago with no memory of who she is and only vague inklings about where she may be from, though her dreams as she calls them, are of places exotic and foreign. The Facebook post reads in part: You see, I cant remember how I got to the hospital (was by firefighters) or where I was before I came to be at the hospital. I was in dire condition when I arrived and was put in intensive care immediately. The woman, who calls herself Sam, is white, appears to be about 50 and speaks English and French with what sounds like a British or Australian accent, according to the global police cooperative Interpol. She is 5 feet 7 inches tall and weighs roughly 200 pounds, and has a chipped front tooth and pierced ears. She has blonde, highlighted hair, is right-handed and near-sighted, and has a smallpox scar on her right arm, the Facebook posting says. On Feb. 1, Sam was found semi-conscious on a street corner near Tamarack Beach, wearing shorts, a navy-blue T-shirt with the words Annapolis Harbor and images of anchors on it, Sperry-brand boat shoes and a Burberry tie. She was admitted to a hospital and diagnosed with a rare form of amnesia. While removing a volleyball sized tumor, physicians determined that she had malignant ovarian cancer, Sam wrote on a Facebook page dedicated to discovering her identity. I have been getting chemotherapy treatments and have lost all of my hair, Sam recounted on the website. My prognosis is not good, and I pray my family will be found soon. Her doctors believe that antibodies associated with her cancer likely caused her memory loss, she said. Attempting to piece together the puzzle are the FBI, as well as law enforcement agencies in Australia, from which the woman believes she may hail, and England. All of my initial dreams (since being hospitalized) had to do with ... swimming in a saltwater pool in Perth, then Icebergs in New South Wales and in Cairns in Queensland and Byron Bay, she related in her posting.

210,"Alameda County sheriffs officials said they are investigating the posting of racist graffiti on a school district truck in unincorporated Castro Valley as a hate crime. Deputies were called to Canyon Middle School at 19600 Cull Canyon Road at about 6 a.m. Monday to investigate a report of racist graffiti and vandalism, sheriffs spokesman Sgt. Ray Kelly said. The deputies found that a school district truck had been targeted with offensive and racist language written on the vehicle with a permanent black marker, according to Kelly. The words consisted of disparaging and offensive racial remarks against members of the Jewish and African American communities, Kelly said. In addition, swastikas were drawn on the vehicle and its rear window was smashed, he said. No one witnessed the crime, but deputies are looking at surveillance footage from the surrounding area as part of their ongoing investigation, according to Kelly. The sheriffs office will dedicate resources to find the person responsible, Kelly said. He added, We take crimes of this nature seriously. Racist and offensive vandalism will not be tolerated in our schools. Kelly said the sheriffs office has been in contact with the Castro Valley Unified School District and the district is assisting in the investigation. At this time, there are no credible threats against students or faculty, he said. Kelly said the sheriffs office has increased patrols in and around all Castro Valley schools. Parents, students and faculty are urged to report any suspicious behavior, or any information they may have about the graffiti, to sheriffs investigators at (510) 667-7721.

211,"CASTRO VALLEY, CA- A woman caught on video shouting insults at Muslim men praying in Lake Chabot Regional Park earlier this month was charged Wednesday with two misdemeanors for the incident, prosecutors said today. Denise Slader has been charged with battery on a school, park or hospital property and violation of civil rights for the confrontation she had with two men on Dec. 6, according to the Alameda County District Attorneys Office. In the video posted online, the woman, identified as Slader, can be seen telling the two men they are deceived by Satan. She later reacts angrily, allegedly hitting him with her umbrella and throwing coffee at him. We take very seriously conduct that infringes upon our citizens right to be free of violence and hatred, District Attorney Nancy OMalley said in a statement. Ms. Sladers actions must be addressed within the criminal justice system. East Bay Regional Park District spokeswoman Carolyn Jones said last week that Slader approached the men as they were praying by the volleyball courts near the park entrance at about 3 p.m. She got into a conversation with the men that escalated into an argument, eventually saying things to them like, Your God is Satan and the Koran is evil, according to Jones. Thats when one of the men started recording her. Slader is talking at the start of the video, saying, The people you torture are going to be in heaven. You are very deceived by Satan. Your mind has been taken over, brainwashed, and youve got nothing but hate. A park ranger tries to intervene, telling her she is being inappropriate, but Slader responds that its inappropriate for the man to tape her. The man taping says, This lady was talking about my God. Thats when Slader allegedly attacked him with her umbrella and coffee. The video does not show exactly what happens, but the man can be heard yelling, Do not touch me! The San Francisco Bay Area chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations praised OMalleys decision today, saying that the group has been receiving increased reports of hostility against Muslims in recent weeks. CAIRs office in Santa Clara was itself mailed a suspicious powder in an envelope last week. A similar incident was also reported at the groups national office in Washington, D.C. on the same day. We commend law enforcements thorough investigation and swift action following this incident, CAIR Northern California civil rights coordinator Brice Hamack said in a statement. With the recent unprecedented rise in hate attacks targeting Muslims across the nation, this sends the message that hate crimes will not be tolerated in the Bay Area. Slader, an employee of the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, is scheduled to be arraigned on the charges on Jan. 7.

212,"CASTRO VALLEY, CA- A woman could face charges after an incident at Lake Chabot Regional Park on Sunday in which she shouted insults at a group of Muslim men praying in the park and then allegedly struck one and threw coffee at him, an East Bay Regional Park District spokeswoman said Wednesday. The woman, identified as Denise Slader, encountered the men around 3 p.m. Sunday at the volleyball courts near the parks entrance, according to parks spokeswoman Carolyn Jones. Jones said Slader is an employee of the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. That department was not immediately available to confirm her employment there. The men were praying and the woman got into a conversation about religion that escalated into an argument. Jones said the victims described the woman saying things like Your God is Satan and the Koran is evil. The men began recording the incident in a video that has since gone viral on social media. The woman can be seen on the video saying The people you torture are going to be in heaven. You are very deceived by Satan. Your mind has been taken over, brainwashed, and youve got nothing but hate. A park ranger can be seen in the video trying to intervene, but the woman responds angrily, saying it is inappropriate for the man to tape her. The victim, who cannot be seen on camera, can be heard saying This lady was talking about my God. The woman then allegedly struck the man with an umbrella and threw her coffee on him, Jones said. Park district police responded and an officer took statements and wrote a report recommending a charge of misdemeanor battery, Jones said. The report is expected to be forwarded to the Alameda County District Attorneys Office today and the decision on whether to pursue a hate crime charge will be left up to prosecutors, Jones said. Jones said prayer in the park is legal, as is stating your views, as long as you dont disturb the peace. Lake Chabot is a very popular park and a very diverse area and 99 times out of 100 people are very tolerant and accepting of each other, Jones said.

213,"The following is a collection of weekly police, court and fire stories from around the Cerritos area this week. The 52-year-old man left a suicide note before departing from his home last week. The victim was pushed to the ground by one of the suspects at a South Bay Starbucks. The 18-year-old is accused of driving the getaway car in a fatal South Los Angeles shooting.F The man was holding an Airsoft or pellet gun that was very realistic-looking, Sheriffs Lt. Rodney Moore told reporters. Police responding to a report of a gunman in Redondo Beach shot and killed the suspect, who turned out to be armed with a pellet gun. One suspect is outstanding after the early morning search near Marine Avenue and Walnut Avenue. Police say the suspect was captured on video surveillance using credit cards stolen from the vehicle burglaries. The woman was in a car when she was shot, according to reports from the scene. She was found about 9 p.m. Tuesday, according to Long Beach police. The driver was heading southbound on Studebaker Road when his vehicle hit a center median and a light pole. The pedestrian was struck at about 9:40 p.m. Friday in the 1400 block of Pacific Avenue. The crash shut down Pacific Coast Highway in both directions between Lewis and Alamitos streets, police said.

214,"- Hundreds of USC students, faculty members and administrators gathered in the center of campus Monday in remembrance of a professor who was fatally stabbed, allegedly by a student who is in custody. Psychology professor Bosco Tjan, 53, of Cerritos had taught at USC since 2001. The victim, whose full name was Siaufung Tjan, according to Lt. Dave Smith of the Los Angeles County coroners office, leaves a wife and son. May each of us, as members of the Trojan family, resolve to bring comfort and support to his wife and child, USC President C.L. Max Nikias said during the ceremony near the Tommy Trojan statue on campus. The event was led by Varun Soni, USC dean of religious life. Tjan was a training faculty member in the USC Neuroscience Graduate Program. He was an expert on perception, vision and vision cognition and helped found the USC Dornsife Cognitive Neuroscience Imaging Center, where he served as co-director, USC officials said. Weve really lost an incredible mind and extremely generous person, said Irving Biederman, Howard Dornsife Professor of Neuroscience and director of the Image Understanding Laboratory. You could not ask for a better colleague. He was brilliant, knowledgeable and helpful to others. His alleged assailant was identified as David Jonathan Brown, 28, of Los Angeles, according to Officer Mike Lopez of the LAPDs Media Relations Section. Brown was arrested Friday on suspicion of murder and his bail was set at $1 million, Lopez said. The stabbing was reported at 4:30 p.m. Friday at the Seeley G. Mudd building in the 3600 block of McClintock Avenue, authorities said. Tjan, who was stabbed in the chest, was pronounced dead at the scene, according to Margaret Stewart of the Los Angeles Fire Department. The USC Department of Public Safety said Brown was arrested without incident. This was not a random act of violence, according to a statement posted on the departments website. The Los Angeles Police Department believes this was the result of a personal dispute. The killing occurred on the final day of classes before finals. -- City News Service, photo courtesy of USC",0,8,5
215,"A 20-year-old man who pleaded guilty to a series of graffiti attacks at and near a Sikh temple in Buena Park failed to appear for sentencing Tuesday and may have jeopardized his plea deal. Brodie Durazo of Buena Park pleaded guilty Feb. 22 to vandalism of religious property and vandalism with less than $400 in damage, both misdemeanors. Another misdemeanor count of vandalism with less than $400 in damage was dropped. When he failed to appear for sentencing Tuesday a bench warrant was issued and then put on hold to see if he would come to court on April 19. If he fails to appear for that court date an arrest warrant is likely to be issued, according to Deputy District Attorney Jess Rodriguez. Its up to the judge on April 19 to decide whether to go through with Durazos plea deal, said Rodriguez, who declined to release the terms of the plea bargain. The vandalism was reported Dec. 6 -- four days after the mass shooting attack by a husband and wife in San Bernardino that is being investigated as an act of terrorism. When Durazo was arrested in December, police said he admitted to vandalizing a truck, a wall in the temples parking lot and a building nearby at 7142 Orangethorpe Ave. Police investigated the graffiti as a possible hate crime due to a profane reference to the Islamic militant group Islamic State group on the truck, although the vandalism on the temples parking lot wall did not reference Islam. --City News Service, photo via Shutterstock",1,3,2
216,"A group of community and faith leaders will gather Monday night for a candlelight vigil and march at Pearson Park in Anaheim, which was rocked by a violent conflict between Ku Klux Klan members and counter- protesters on Saturday. Rusty Kennedy, the executive director of the Orange County Human Relations Commission, will be among them. He said its important for the community to denounce hate groups like the KKK that have thrown fliers weighted down in baggies into yards in the area, including on last years Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. Kennedy, however, said officials and journalists have to walk a fine line in how they publicize KKK marches beforehand. This is a media strategy, Kennedy said of KKK gatherings in public places. Without the media, these guys would go unnoticed. They would absolutely go unnoticed without the pre-press announcing it and the counter- demonstrators wouldnt even have noticed it. Groups like the KKK these days have ever-dwindling membership and sparse turnouts for events, Kennedy said. In Saturdays conflict, the counter- demonstrators outnumbered the KKK group by about 30 to six, according to police. Kennedy pointed to a Westboro Baptist Church protest before the funeral of Crystal Cathedral founder Robert Schuller last April as an example. The group, which is best known for making anti-gay slurs at the funerals of soldiers, sent about four of its members for a protest in front of an Anaheim high school, Kennedy said. A lot of us showed up ... to be a buffer and a voice of reason, and sure, enough, they showed up, only about four of them, and they were immediately mobbed by 200 people there, Kennedy said. So just a few of them created headlines just by the nasty nature of their words and the headlines drew a reaction, and that reaction tells you theres going to be some confrontation and confrontation is key to the news -- its what always gets covered. In the case of Saturdays conflict, Anaheim police sent out a message on Twitter Friday warning residents to stay away from the area as there were rumors of a KKK gathering and counter-protest. The tweet was a response to OC Weekly reports on the KKK gathering, Anaheim police Sgt. Daron Wyatt said. Police sent out the tweet letting residents know about the KKK gathering because there is usually some angst that goes with the distribution of racist fliers in the community, Wyatt said. Kennedy said its a two-edged sword in news coverage of the Klan. When the media portrays them in advance in a big way, they contribute to them, they serve as a third arm in getting the word out, Kennedy said. If they waited until the day of their advertised demonstrations and went down there, they might have found out, yeah, theres 10 guys with funny-looking shirts on with patches all over them with people looking at them quizzically. And thered be a few counter-demonstrators and a fairly non-newsworthy event. Kennedy added, however, that it is also dangerous to ignore hate groups because it may signal a sort of tacit approval. Their message of hate strikes terror in the heart of the community, and we as a community have to step up and say thats not welcome here, Kennedy said. J.B. Wagoner of Irvine, who went to the park to protest against the Klan, said most of the activists he was with did not have any violent intentions. My intent was to be there as a nonviolent protester -- to demonstrate against the KKK, Wagoner said. Im sad it came to violence at the park, but Im glad to see the unity against this racist group. He added, I believe most of the protesters were there to say, Yeah, you have your First Amendment rights, but what youre espousing is wrong. As for which side instigated the melee, Wagoner said, I dont know who really started it, but added, Its a signature of the KKK showing up at a park to promote hate, so is that starting it? Wagoner said he saw protests in Anaheim a few years ago following back- to-back officer-involved shootings that prompted demonstrations that at times turned violent, but he praised the way police handled Saturdays fracas. They showed up and didnt overreact, Wagoner said. They arrested people involved in fighting. They didnt pepper-spray or shoot anybody. It seemed like they were willing to let people express their First Amendment rights and then it got out of hand. But even after it got out of hand, they seemed to act responsibly. Five men, who were part of the counter-protest group, sustained stab wounds in the conflict, according to Wyatt. Two were treated at the scene, one refused further treatment and two were taken to area hospitals, with one remaining hospitalized today with injuries that were not considered life-threatening, Wyatt said. Police identified those who were booked in connection with the Pearson Park incident as: Schop, who listed her occupation as teacher, was released on her own recognizance, according to jail records, which indicate that at least two of the arrested suspects had been in jail earlier this month and got out after completing their punishment. --City News Service",1,0,0
217,"Four people were arrested today for their alleged involvement in a run-in with a waitress who was struck and injured by a vehicle when she confronted them outside an Anaheim-area restaurant as they drove away without paying their bill. The hit-and-run occurred at 6:22 p.m. Sunday at the Mexico Lindo restaurant in the 10900 block of Magnolia Street, said Orange County sheriffs Lt. Lloyd Downing. Four patrons, a male and three females, left without paying, and the 19- year-old waitress ran out to the parking lot to confront them, Downing said. She was run over by a black Volkswagen Jetta with paper plates that kept going, he said. The car ran over the waitress legs, but they were not broken. She was transported to UCI Medical Center with abrasions and bruises. It wasnt a smart idea for her to go out and confront them, Downing said. That wasnt an accident. They werent getting away. They wanted her out of the way. About 1 this morning, deputies patrolling in the Stanton area saw a black Volkswagen sedan in the parking lot of a Motel 6 in the 7400 block of Katella Avenue, sheriffs Lt. Jeffrey Hallock said. Following a preliminary investigation, it was determined the vehicle was connected to the incident at the Mexico Lindo Restaurant, and the four suspects were staying at the motel, Hallock said. Deputies made contact with the four suspects at the motel, and, following their investigation, determined they were involved in the incident. Arrested were Rowshaid Pellum, 24, a Cerritos man who is believed to have been the driver; and three Long Beach women: Markeisha Williams, 18, Shyteice Miles, 19, and Santeea Ralph, 23, Hallock said. All four were booked on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon, conspiracy and defrauding an innkeeper, and each was held on $25,000 bail, Hallock said. All were expected to appear in court on Tuesday in Santa Ana.

218,"An Artesia woman sued the county today, alleging sheriffs deputies mishandled her report that she fought off a man who invaded her home and downplayed her allegations because she is black. Vivica Keyes, 55, filed the lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court, alleging violation of equal protection, racial and gender discrimination and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Shes seeking unspecified damages. The complaint alleges the Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department has a pattern and practice of discriminatory conduct in which crimes reported by blacks, especially black women, are not investigated in the same way as are those filed by members of other races. Sheriffs spokeswoman Nicole Nishida did not immediately reply to request for comment. But Nishida previously said the case was fully investigated and that appropriate charges were filed against the intruder. Keyes says she woke up to find a stranger in her living room dripping blood after apparently breaking into her home through the kitchen window on Jan. 23, 2014. Her court papers allege the man, later identified as 29-year-old Long Beach resident Jason Damour, grabbed her and the two fought until she was able to free herself, dial 911 and run to a neighbors house. According to the lawsit, a deputy dispatched to Keyes home told her that Damour did not commit a burglary because nothing was stolen and that he did not assault or batter Keyes because the plaintiff was unhurt. Keyes was covered in blood from her hair to her feet, but neither the deputies nor the paramedics who came later asked her if she was hurt or needed medical help, her suit alleges. The deputy who allegedly minimized the incident subsequently told Keyes that Damours parents were present and wanted to speak to her and ask her to not press charges because their son had never been in trouble before, according to the suit. Keyes says she was shocked and did not agree to the parents request. The Sheriffs Department eventually made a report on the incident in response to demands by Keyes, but the contents were false and misleading and intended to minimize the nature of the crimes committed against her, the suit alleges. Damour was ultimately charged with misdemeanor trespassing and vandalism because deputies said he placed his hands on Keyes shoulders and did not appear to commit any violence, the suit states.

219,"By PAUL J. YOUNG, City News Service: Two Southern California men who planned to commit violent jihad against American troops by joining terrorist groups in Afghanistan were each sentenced Monday to 25 years in federal prison. Sohiel Omar Kabir, 36, of Pomona and Ralph Kenneth DeLeon, 26, of Ontario, were convicted last September following a nearly monthlong trial at the federal courthouse in downtown Riverside. Kabir was found guilty of two counts of conspiring to provide material support to terrorists and one count each of conspiring to kill American troops and conspiring to receive military training from al-Qaida. DeLeon was convicted by the same seven-man, five-woman jury of conspiring to provide material support to terrorists, conspiring to murder or maim members of the armed services overseas, and conspiring to kill employees of the United States. U.S. District Judge Virginia Phillips sentenced the men separately in hearings that collectively lasted just over three hours. In pronouncing sentence for Kabir, Phillips said it was hard to understate the seriousness of the offense. It wasnt just talk, she said. Weve seen all too often how little it takes for young men to cause havoc and loss of life. Just because his plan didnt come to fruition -- it doesnt reduce the seriousness of what he intended to do. Kabirs attorney, Federal Public Defender Jeffrey Aaron, argued for a 10- year prison term, citing mitigating factors, including what he said was his clients low I.Q. Phillips was not swayed, pointing out that Kabirs own family had acknowledged he was intelligent, though admittedly lazy. The judge said Kabir had been given every break after his family fled to the U.S. as refugees and were given asylum. He is an example of someone who betrayed the hospitality extended to him by this country, Phillips said. Kabir, clad in a white jail jumpsuit and sporting a shaved head and chest-length beard, declined to address the court. DeLeons attorney, David Thomas, also requested a 10-year sentence for his client, telling the judge that he had undergone a reformation since being jailed in 2012. Thomas said DeLeon embraced an extremely warped religious fanaticism out of a desperate, though perverse, desire to achieve something meaningful in his life. He allowed himself to be surrounded by the wrong types of influences, the attorney said. It made him want to be the best extreme Muslim he could be. He jumped right into the deep end, and he sunk. Assistant U.S. Attorney Chris Grigg countered that DeLeon had enormous family support, had been gifted a car and was less than two months shy of attaining a bachelors degree in business when he threw it all away in the interest of committing unfathomable acts of violence. He said he wanted to be on the frontlines, Grigg said. He eschewed the idea of being a suicide bomber because he said he wanted to be able to see the suffering of those he targeted. Phillips ordered that both men be placed on lifetime supervision, or parole, following their release from prison. In a sentencing brief, the U.S. Attorneys Office noted that Kabir was the emir, or leader, of the group and that he converted DeLeon and (Miguel Alejandro Santana Vidriales) to Islam ... (and) encouraged them to travel overseas to engage in violent jihad. Kabir ... encouraged the group to join him in Afghanistan, including by telling them about his connections to the Taliban and al-Qaida, discussing his physical preparations for fighting and warfare, and various missions and operations he was asked by terrorists to participate in, the document states. Vidriales, 24, of Mexico and 23-year-old Arifeen David Gojali of Riverside both reached plea agreements with the government several weeks before DeLeon and Kabir went on trial last August. Theyre in custody and slated to be sentenced March 16. Gojali testified that he was persuaded to take up arms against the U.S., Britain and Israel after several conversations with DeLeon, a native of the Philippines who converted to Islam in 2011. The government presented hours of secretly taped audio recordings between DeLeon and a confidential source, identified in court documents only as a Muslim man who worked for the FBI and won the defendants trust by pretending to subscribe to jihadist views. DeLeons enthusiasm for Holy War was such that he felt killing in the name of Allah and the Prophet Mohammed would mean guaranteed paradise, according to a transcript of one recording. He told the confidential source that fighting takes precedence over everything else. According to prosecutors, DeLeon had downloaded audio files containing anti-American tirades by terrorist cleric Anwar al-Awlaki and figures of similar stature among Islamists. Kabir met several of his co-defendants at the Al-Sabreen Mosque in Pomona. They would often socialize at an inland hookah bar, smoking marijuana and listening to Kabir share tales of terrorists exploits, according to trial testimony. According to the government, Kabir left the U.S. for Germany and eventually joined relatives in Kabul in 2011. Once in Afghanistan, he corresponded with his co-defendants via social networking sites and Skype. Kabir described his journey overseas as a one-way trip, encouraging the others to join him and providing cover stories for how they could get through customs without raising suspicions, court papers show. Kabir told DeLeon in an October 2012 conversation that he had an al- Qaida connection and was working on spinning everything up. According to prosecutors, the defendants conducted physical training, hiking and weight-lifting, and also honed their shooting skills during trips to area firing ranges and paintball facilities. Gojali, Vidriales and DeLeon were arrested as they were loading the latters car for a trip to Mexico City International Airport -- from which they intended to fly to Istanbul, Turkey -- on Nov. 16, 2012. Kabir was arrested about the same time by FBI agents in Kabul. (Image via Shutterstock)",1,3,0

222,"A man who was convicted of second-degree murder for his role in the brutal beating and strangulation death of Newark transgender teenager Gwen Araujo 14 years ago was granted parole by a state Board of Parole Hearings panel Friday. However, the ruling by a two-member state Board of Parole Hearings panel on Wednesday to grant parole to Jose Merel, whos now 36, is only the beginning of a five-month process to determine whether he will be allowed to go free after 14 years in custody, according to Alameda County Deputy District Attorney Jill Klinge. The state Board of Parole Hearings legal staff now has four months to review the ruling to see if its consistent with the evidence that was presented at Merels hearing at the Salinas Valley State Prison in Soledad, said Klinge, who participated in the hearing. If the legal staff approves Merels appeal, Gov. Jerry Brown will have a month to approve the decision, modify it, ask for all 12 members of the panel to review it or simply let it stand. Merel was one of four men who were convicted for their roles in the death of Araujo, 17, at Merels house in Newark in the early morning hours of Oct. 4, 2002. The incident sparked outrage among the transgender community nationwide. Michael Magidson, whos also 36 now, was also convicted of second-degree murder. Merel and Magidson were both sentenced to 15 years to life in state prison. Jason Cazares was prosecuted along with Merel and Magidson at two highly-publicized trials in 2004 and 2005 but jurors deadlocked on his fate at both trials. He pleaded no contest to the lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter in December 2005 so he wouldnt have to risk a murder conviction at a third trial and was sentenced one month later to six years in state prison. Jurors deadlocked on the fate of all three defendants at their first trial in 2004 and Merel and Magidson were convicted at the end of the second trial. A fourth defendant, Jaron Nabors, pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in 2003 in exchange for his testimony against the other three men and in 2006 he was sentenced to 11 years in state prison. Cazares and Nabors have both been out of prison for many years. Araujo was born as a male named Eddie but presented herself as a woman. According to prosecutor Chris Lamiero, who handled both trials, the four men killed Araujo following a night of drinking and smoking marijuana when they discovered that the beautiful woman theyd been socializing with for several months actually was a biological male. According to testimony in the two trials, Araujo had sex with all of the men except Cazares. Klinge said Araujos mother, Sylvia Guerrero, supports granting parole to Merel because she thinks hes always been remorseful about his involvement in Araujos death but most of Araujos other family members oppose granting Merel parole. Magidson had a parole hearing at the Valley State Prison in Chowchilla on Wednesday but Klinge said that at the last minute Magidson stipulated that hes still unsuitable for parole at this time and he wont be eligible for parole again for three years. Klinge said Magidson has had a poor prison record and has been cited for disciplinary violations numerous times. Magidson was unapologetic and unremorseful when he and Merel were sentenced on Jan. 27, 2006, saying This case was based entirely on lies by the witnesses and my co-defendants and encouraged by the prosecutor. He said, Im here with my head held high and claimed, I didnt receive a fair trial. After the hearing, Lamiero said, Mr. Magidson didnt do himself any favors with his comment and said his words will come back to haunt him when he faces a parole board. However, Klinge said Magidson is now more remorseful. At the sentencing hearing for Merel and Magidson, Araujos aunt, Emma Rodrigues, said Araujo used poor judgment in partying with the four men over a period of several months but said Araujo shouldnt have paid for that mistake with her life. Rodrigues said that because Araujo was transgender, She was rejected at school, at church and even by her own family. Rodrigues said that one time Araujo opened a Bible and asked, Where does God have a place for people like me? Klinge said Guerrero has been affected so much by Araujos death that she never went back to the legal secretary position she held for 16 years and is now homeless.

223,"A series of robberies at a community center, a rock thrown through a window at a thrift store and a batch of hateful graffiti scrawled on an office wall have combined to seriously rattle the local LGBT community in Concord. The Rainbow Community Center, which offers low-cost counseling and support services to the LGBT community, was the target of repeated break-ins and vandalism over the course of a few weeks starting in August, according to the centers executive director David Barr. The first incident was in mid-August, when somebody threw a rock through the window of the centers thrift shop during store hours, Barr said. Nobody was hurt, Barr said, but it frightened the employees. Then, on four separate occasions starting on Aug. 21 and ending Oct. 5, somebody broke into the community center and made off with computers, a projector, cash and several electronic storage devices, Barr said. After each break-in, the center improved its security measures, but each time the thieves were able to get back in. During the last burglary, someone scrawled anti-LGBT messages on an office wall in an incident that Concord police are calling a hate crime, according to police spokesman Cpl. Christopher Blakely. Were just in shock. There are so few places where gay and lesbian people can come together and feel safe, Barr said. To have one of those very few places in our county have this level of attack has just left us feeling very, very vulnerable. In one of the burglaries, the suspects took valuable donor information, including credit card account information and canceled checks, Barr said. Soon, charges were popping up on the accounts for pizza, hotel rooms in Antioch and gift certificates from auto parts stores, he said. Its just excruciating, Barr said. Its very chaotic for our staff. On the positive side, Barr said theyve seen an incredible outpouring of support from the community. A mom baked us cookies and brought in Danish, he said. Weve had many people step forward with that kind of encouragement and support. Police have yet to make an arrest or identify any suspects in the case, Blakely said, but officers are reviewing security camera footage and processing fingerprints and other evidence taken after the break-ins. Anyone with information about these crimes is asked to call Concord police at (925) 671-3333. The center, at 2118 Willow Pass Road, is hosting an open house on Wednesday, Oct, 19 beginning at 4:30 p.m. to show resilience in the face of those that would try to bring us down.

224,"SAN DIEGO - A pharmacist testified Thursday that he shot his female roommates boyfriend at the door of his Ocean Beach condominium because he was afraid the victim was going to come inside and make good on his threats to hurt him. Thomas Francis Burke, 33, is charged with murder in the June 22, 2016, death of 35-year-old Jess Robles. Burke claims he shot the victim in self-defense. A tearful defendant testified that he was armed when he heard a bang on his door just after 11 p.m. Burke said the door flew open and he saw Robles standing in the doorway, three feet away. I saw rage in his eyes, the defendant testified. I saw him going down like he was going to tackle me. I thought he was there to damage me or harm me. Burke, who said he was standing on a landing, testified that he took his gun out of his front pocket, pointed it at Robles, and shot him twice. I didnt know I hit him until I saw him fall backward, the defendant testified. After the shooting, Burke said he jumped from a second-story area and ran off, then started calling defense attorneys, his mother and friends. He turned himself in hours later. Deputy District Attorney Kyle Sutterley said in his opening statement that one of Burkes roommates, Larae Clark, started dating the victim a couple of months before he was killed. Burke and Clark grew up in New Jersey and Burke harbored romantic and sexual feelings for her, the prosecutor told jurors. The defendants jealousy began to consume him and a few days before the murder, he wrote to Clark, telling her, I think Ill always be attracted to you, Sutterley said. On his computer, Burke wrote, I cant take her going out with other people, the prosecutor said. Burke also called Robles derogatory names and an hour before the murder wrote, I hate him, according to Sutterley. The prosecutor said Robles -- who was out with Clark the night he was killed -- read some of Burkes text messages to her and responded, Sounds like you have a lot to say behind my back. Hope you can back it up! A Lyft driver dropped Clark and Robles at the condo about 11 p.m., and she went inside, where she got into an argument with Burke, Sutterley said. Robles decided to check on Clark when she was gone longer than anticipated and knocked on the condo door, he said. Burke opened the door and shot Robles once in the chest and once in the throat and said, Hes dead, according to the prosecutor. After the shooting, Burke called another of his roommates to say, I just shot Jess and Im probably going to jail. The defendant will continue his testimony Friday.

225,"One of the victims of the Oakland Ghost Ship fire identified Sunday was a Coronado native and an employee at the Berkeley publishing house Counterpoint Press. Nick Gomez-Hall, 25, originally from Coronado, was an artist and had recently begun designing books. He worked as an administrative assistant at Counterpoint, according to reports. Gomez-Halls Facebook page shows that he was interested in social justice issues like racial inequality and the environment. On Nov. 28, his most recent publicly available post, he asked his friends to consider donating money to Mark Baumer, an author and activist who is walking barefoot across the U.S. Follow his walk if you want to see a real human experiencing pain, joy, and wonder, Gomez-Hall wrote. Follow his walk if you oppose racism, capitalism, and environmental destruction. Gomez-Halls Facebook page indicates that he used to live in Providence, Rhode Island. A 2011 article from The Brown Daily Herald – the student newspaper at Brown University, located in Providence – quotes Gomez-Hall praising a Brown instructor, Mark Baumer. The article indicates that Gomez-Hall was on track to graduate from Brown in 2013. The Ghost Ship fire broke out Friday night during an electronic music concert at a warehouse in the Fruitvale neighborhood of Oakland. At least 33 people died, although authorities still have 60 percent of the building left to search. The fire broke out around 11:30 Friday night during the Golden Donna 100% Silk 2016 West Coast Tour rave. Oakland officials have said that the building was being used as a live-work space for artists. There were apparently no fire alarms or working sprinklers inside the building. When firefighters arrived Friday night, they were met with flames shooting out of three sides of the building. The fire grew so intense that it became too dangerous for them to enter.

226,"A former government official who oversaw operations and maintenance at the Otay Mesa, San Ysidro and Tecate ports of entry was sentenced Friday to 16 months in federal prison for carrying out a nearly decade- long conspiracy to solicit bribes and steal federal property. Timothy Francis Cashman, 54, admitted in April that he used his position as a building manager for the General Services Administration for his personal enrichment by demanding kickbacks and services in exchange for favorable treatment in awarding GSA contracts. In sentencing Cashman in a San Diego courtroom, Judge Gonzalo Curiel noted that the defendant was a religious man who had performed many good deeds and selfless acts. Nonetheless, Curiel said, it was vital that Cashmans punishment reflect the fact that quid pro quo is not the status quo in government service. In addition to handing down the custody sentence, the judge also ordered Cashman to serve three years of post-incarceration supervised release and pay about $50,000 in restitution. According to prosecutors, Cashman used his position with the GSA to create schemes for self-benefit instead of working to fulfill the agencys core mission of delivering maximum value in real estate, equipment acquisition and technology services to government agencies and U.S. taxpayers. Under one such illicit arrangement, Cashman directed contractor Hugo Alonso Inc. to give him $10,000 in cash and perform thousands of dollars worth of free construction services -- including painting, re-roofing and window replacement -- on the defendants Lakeside home, according to court documents. Cashman also admitted that he had HAI pay another government contractor $120,000 in order to land a construction job at the Otay Mesa Port of Entry, and conceded that he accepted six checks totaling $42,000 from the second firm and deposited the funds into his own bank account. Cashman concealed all income received from HAI when submitting his federal income-tax returns, court documents state. In addition, Cashman stole thousands of dollars worth of government building materials -- including copper cable, stainless-steel panels and heavy brass letters spelling out United States Border Inspection Station -- by getting contractors and others to pack them up and transport them away from GSA facilities, according to the plea agreement. HAI, and its principal, Hugo Alonso, conceded to breaking the law in connection with Cashmans schemes and were previously sentenced. In all, 11 people were arrested and pleaded guilty in related corruption investigations, according to the U.S. Attorneys Office in San Diego.  --City News Service",0,8,5
227,"A UCLA facilities employee from Inglewood arrested in 2014 by campus police is suing the department and the University of California Board of Regents, alleging that he was targeted because he is black. Claudius Gaines lawsuit, which alleges civil rights violations, also names as defendants Officer Brandon Young, who is white, and Officer Fabiola Leon, whose ethnicity is not mentioned in the complaint. The suit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court on Tuesday additionally alleges assault and battery, false imprisonment and negligence. Gaines is seeking unspecified damages. This lawsuit concerns the ominous subject of racial profiling being committed by members of the UCLA (campus police) against members of the African- American community who happen to travel around the Westwood campus, the lawsuit states. UCLA issued a statement saying the university strongly disputes the allegations made in the lawsuit and will vigorously defend itself in the course of the litigation. The University of California Police Department seeks to ensure that its police officers apply the law equally to all persons. All officers receive ongoing training to recognize implicit bias and to prevent racial profiling in carrying out their law enforcement duties, the statement says. A Los Angeles Superior Court judge, David Cunningham, was himself a previous victim of racial profiling by UCLA police, prompting the department to retrain every member of its staff on the problem and pay $500,000, according to a claim filed and settled on the judges behalf by attorney Carl Douglas, who also represents Gaines. According to Gaines lawsuit, he was leaving work between 11:30 a.m. and midnight Aug. 27, 2014, to drive his truck to his Inglewood home when he was stopped near the UCLA campus. Young was driving the police car, the suit states. Mr. Gaines ... believes that Young pulled him over (even) though he had not broken any law or public offense, but because he looked like he didnt belong in that neighborhood, the suit says. After being told to produce his drivers license and registration, Gaines put both hands on the steering wheel, according to his suit, which says one of the officers then grabbed Gaines by his arm and ordered him out of the truck. He was arrested for allegedly resisting, delaying or obstructing a police officer. Claudius Gaines did nothing to justify this use of unreasonable force or false imprisonment against him, the suit says. The suit alleges Young and Leon were not properly trained by the department to avoid racial profiling, as well as excessive force and false imprisonment against motorists with whom they interact. According to UCLAs statement, the Los Angeles City Attorneys Office filed misdemeanor obstruction of a police officer and resisting arrest charges against Gaines. A jury failed to reach a verdict in the case on Nov. 4, according to the university. --City News Service, photo courtesy of UCLA",0,8,5
228,"On the same day a JetBlue Airways flight attendant who allegedly tried to carry 70 pounds of cocaine onto a plane at LAX was due to appear in court, two former baggage handlers at the airport were arrested Monday for allegedly smuggling cocaine past security as part of a nationwide drug ring. Adrian Ponce, 27, and Alberto Preciado Gutierrez, 26, both of South Gate, were also expected to make initial court appearances Monday in downtown Los Angeles. According to federal authorities, the pair were involved in a nationwide conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute cocaine. Ponce and Gutierrez allegedly used airport credentials to smuggle cocaine past security and pass it along to third-party couriers who took the drugs aboard commercial flights to deliver to customers on the East Coast. Prosecutors said authorities seized a kilogram of cocaine from Gutierrez on Dec. 16, 2015, in a Terminal 3 restroom at Los Angeles International Airport, where he was trying to pass the drugs to a man planning to fly to New York on a JetBlue flight. Ponce, who was waiting for Gutierrez in a vehicle outside the terminal, was interviewed the next day and allegedly admitted that the pair took part in similar transactions on multiple occasions. Gutierrez had been working for Swissport International at LAX, but he was fired by the company following the December drug seizure, according to the U.S. Attorneys Office. Ponce previously worked at LAX for a baggage-handling service that was recently acquired by Swissport. Both men face 10 years to life in prison if convicted of drug trafficking, prosecutors said. Their arrests came on the same day that Marsha Gay Reynolds, 31, was set to make an initial appearance in Los Angeles for allegedly trying to smuggle 70 pounds of cocaine aboard a flight from LAX on March 18. Authorities said Reynolds, a former Jamaican beauty contestant and college track-and-field athlete, had the drugs in her carry-on bags, but she kicked off her Gucci heels and fled when she was pulled aside for additional security screening at the airport. Reynolds was arrested in New York. --City News Service.",0,8,5

231,"A 51-year-old man believed to be the so-called Western Bandit suspected in a string of violent crimes along a stretch of Western Avenue from Hollywood to South Los Angeles was in custody today. Details of the arrest were expected to be released this afternoon by Los Angeles police Chief Charlie Beck and Mayor Eric Garcetti. The suspect was identified by police as Patrick Watkins. Detectives earlier said the suspect may have been responsible for one killing, as well as a number of armed robberies since November of 2011. The crimes occurred in convenience stores and other businesses, generally between 9 p.m. and 7 a.m., along an eight-mile stretch of Western Avenue, according to police. Police had described the suspect as very violent and quick to use a firearm. He was believed to have generally worn dark clothing and was often seen riding a bicycle.

232,"A British porn star who was arrested at Los Angeles International Airport for attempting to smuggle a half-pound of crystal meth in a body cavity was today ordered to spend two years in federal prison. Philip Gizzie, who uses the stage name Bruno Knight, must also serve three years of supervised release after getting out of prison. I am sorry to you and your country, Gizzie told U.S. District Judge Manuel Real. In a letter to the court, Gizzie said he had been addled by drugs at the time of the crime and was thankful for the sobriety he found during five months in a federal lockup. Gizzie, 31, was arrested June 16 after he told LAX customs officers that he had inserted three large objects containing methamphetamine into a body cavity, according to an affidavit filed in support of the criminal complaint. Gizzie pleaded guilty in August to a federal count of possession with intent to distribute meth. Defense attorney Neha A. Meta, arguing for a six-month sentence, told Real that her clients crime was driven by addiction. Hes not a sophisticated drug dealer, she said. It was mostly for his personal use. Assistant U.S. Attorney Vanessa Baehr-Jones said Gizzies crime warranted the two-year term. The transportation of drugs internationally is a very serious offense, the prosecutor said outside the courtroom. According to the affidavit, Gizzie was scheduled to depart LAX on a flight to London after what he described as a weekend of partying with friends in North Hollywood. Acting on an anonymous tip to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, customs officials located Gizzie, who had no checked luggage, and began questioning him. Gizzie, appearing nervous and sweating profusely, told officers that he had taken meth, marijuana, cocaine and the narcotic sedative known as GHB over the weekend but was not high at the moment, the affidavit said. During a secondary inspection, Gizzie told officers that he was carrying three packets of meth in his body. Gizzie expelled two of these objects at LAX and passed the third object at Centinela Hospital, the affidavit states, describing the weight of the drugs as 226 grams. Describing himself as an HIV-positive porn actor and male escort, Gizzie said he had left London three days earlier with his partner, a Virgin Atlantic flight attendant. Gizzie has worked for several gay porn studios. In a scene from the 2011 porno film Security Control, Gizzie plays an airport security guard who searches another porn actors body for drugs. —City News Service Image: Wikipedia",0,8,5
233,"A Sunnyvale man accused of killing his co-worker in Santa Claras Central Park earlier this month made his first court appearance today in the Santa Clara County Hall of Justice. Gage McCartney, 25, represented by Deputy Public Defender Matt Wilson, was arraigned on one count of murder and will remain in custody without bail. He did not enter a plea. McCartney and the victim, Raynard Hyde, 54, of Campbell, both worked at a Safeway on 2760 Homestead Road, according to Santa Clara police. On the night of July 19, Hyde clocked out of work at 9 p.m. and met McCartney at a McDonalds at 3509 Homestead Road a couple hours later to eat dinner and drink alcohol, police said. The two men went back to Safeway at about 11 p.m. to buy more alcohol. Surveillance video showed the two men dancing, intoxicated and in good spirits, according to police. The men then went across the street to Central Park in Hydes car. In a statement of facts, police said McCartney told officers that Hyde made unwanted sexual advances toward him at the park. According to police, McCartney said he pushed Hyde away and punched him twice in the face when Hyde allegedly tried to kiss him. McCartney said he then put his hands around Hydes neck and squeezed, making the victim fall to the ground. McCartney thought Hyde had become unconscious, and left the park furious over Hydes alleged sexual advances, police said. McCartney allegedly demonstrated to investigators how he choked the victim, and explained that instinct took over when he attacked Hyde. Police were initially investigating Hydes death as suspicious, but the Santa Clara County medical examiners office later ruled it a homicide by strangulation. McCartney was arrested last Tuesday and was booked in the Santa Clara County Main Jail without bail. McCartneys suggestion that he attacked Hyde because of unwanted sexual advances invokes the gay panic defense, which was banned in California in 2014. Only two other states, Illinois and Rhode Island, have also implemented the ban. DArcy Kemnitz, executive director of the National LGBT Bar Association, could not comment on the specifics of McCartneys case, but said the gay panic defense has led to light sentences after suspects committed brutal attacks in states where the defense is not banned. It is unconscionable and unfair to the victim to bring up whether or not they are gay or not gay, Kemnitz said. Otherwise it turns into, Did the victim bring it upon themselves? Were they asking for it? Deputy District Attorney Alaleh Kianerci said outside of court that detectives are still investigating the motive for McCartneys alleged homicide, but noted the gay panic defense can still be used in a limited capacity despite the 2014 ban. The gay panic defense can no longer reduce a murder charge to involuntary manslaughter by claiming the murder was a heat of passion act, according to Kianerci. However, attorneys can still consider the claim -- if it is backed by reliable evidence -- to determine if the victim was provoked. Kianerci added that there is currently no indication of race-based motivation for the homicide. A Safeway spokeswoman said last week that the store is cooperating with police in their investigation. We mourn the unexpected loss of Ray Hyde. We send our deepest and heartfelt condolences to Rays family, friends, and co-workers. Our team at the Homestead store will miss seeing him at work, spokeswoman Wendy Gutshall said in a statement. Ramone Hyde, the victims brother, shared the news of Hydes death on Facebook last week, saying Hyde loved his family and God, loved to laugh and was the absolute best big brother ever. Hyde attended the Cathedral of Faith in San Jose, according to the church, and many remarked on Hydes faith in God and the religious songs he would sing. Others said Hyde was a beautiful person and a joy to have known. Judge Arthur Bocanegra set McCartneys plea hearing for Sept. 25 at the Santa Clara County Hall of Justice.

238,"The widow of a shooter who killed 49 people in a Florida nightclub last year has agreed to be transferred to Orlando, Fla., to face federal charges of aiding her husband in the attack. Noor Salman, 30, agreed to be moved to Florida in a court filing submitted Tuesday to U.S. Magistrate Donna Ryu of Oakland. On Wednesday, Ryu signed an order committing Salman to the jurisdiction of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida in Orlando and directing the U.S. Marshals Service to transport her there. Salmans lawyer, Charles Swift of the Texas-based Constitutional Law Center for Muslims in America, said Wednesday it will be up to the Marshals Service to decide when she will be transferred. I expect it to be fairly soon, said Swift. He said he could not comment further on the case. Salmans husband, Omar Mateen, killed 49 people and wounded 53 others in a gunfire attack on the gay Pulse nightclub in Orlando on June 12, in the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. He died in a shootout with police. Salman was arrested on Jan. 16 in her mothers home in Rodeo, where she and her 4-year-old son were staying. She was indicted four days earlier by a federal grand jury in Orlando on two criminal charges. The charges are aiding her husband in providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization, namely the Islamic State; and obstructing justice by misleading local police and the FBI when she was questioned in the hours following the attack. Because Salman was arrested within the jurisdiction of the U.S. District Court for Northern California, her initial court appearances were in federal court in Oakland. On March 1, Ryu ruled that she could be released on a $500,000 bond into the custody of her uncle, Abdallah Salman of Rodeo, under conditions of home confinement except for court hearings. But on March 10, U.S. District Judge Paul Byron of Orlando, the trial judge assigned to the case, overruled Ryu and denied bail. He agreed with prosecutors claim that Salman is a danger to the community and a flight risk. Salman is now appealing Byrons ruling to the 11th U.S. Court of Appeals in Atlanta. Salman, one of four daughters in a family of Palestinian descent, was born in Richmond and grew up in Rodeo. She met Mateen on an online dating site and moved with him to Fort Pierce, Fla., when they married. After the nightclub shooting, Salman lived with an aunt in Mississippi for several months before moving to her mothers house in Rodeo. Salman was entitled under court rules to have further hearings in federal court in Oakland to confirm her identity and determine whether she should be transferred to Florida. She waived those rights in her court filing on Tuesday. Prosecutors contend Salman accompanied her husband on three trips to case possible shooting sites and was aware that her husband left their home on the evening of June 11 with a rifle and a backpack full of ammunition. Defense attorneys maintain that she was abused by Mateen, has learning disabilities, has no strong religious or political views and was not aware of his plans. --Bay City News/Photo courtesy of the Orlando Police Department",1,3,0

No other suspects are believed to be involved in the crime. The vandalism occurred just before 4 am on Jan. 22 at the Islamic Center of Davis, located on Russell Boulevard in Davis. Security cameras recorded a female smashing several large windows, vandalizing two bicycles and then wrapping pork bacon around the mosques door handles. The repair costs exceeded $7,000. Authorities say that soon after the crime was reported and the surveillance footage was released, Davis police received numerous tips regarding the vandalism. From the outset, the case was investigated as a hate crime by both the Davis Police Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which was called in to assist local investigative efforts. The case has now been turned over to the Yolo County District Attorney for prosecution. Previous coverage: Davis Mosque Vandalized; Hate Crime Suspected Image via Islamic Center of Davis",1,3,2
241,"- The City of Davis is now offering a reward for the person who broke windows, damaged bicycles and left uncooked pork at a local mosque, resulting in between $5,000 and $10,000 in damage. The citys Hate Crime Reward Fund is offering $1,000 for information leading to the arrest and prosecution of the person who recently vandalized the Davis Islamic Center. The fund was created about 15 years ago with contributions from Davis residents when there was a rise of anti-Muslim incidents in an East Davis residential area. The citys $1,000 reward is in addition to a $1,000 reward being offered by the Sacramento branch of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, or CAIR, a Muslim civil liberties and advocacy organization. The suspect, who can been seen in the above video, is described as a white female adult, between 25-35 years old, 54-58 tall and about 160-180 lbs. The suspect has red/brown wavy hair and was seen wearing beige hightop shoes, gray or blue tight fitting pants, an off-white vest and an unknown color shirt with an unknown logo. The suspect also wore a black hat with an unknown logo. Image via public domain",1,3,2

244,"DAVIS - Davis Police are investigating a confrontation Tuesday at the Amtrak train station as a hate crime. Police say at approximately 10:42 a.m., officers responded to the Amtrak train station for a call of a Hate Crime/Battery. When they arrived, officers found the victim, a 32 year old Ethiopian male, who stated that he was assaulted and beaten by a white male. The victim allegedly told officers the suspect approached him and made an unprovoked and racially derogatory comment. The suspect then kicked the victim on the shin and pushed him down using his hands. Police say the victim lost his balance and fell onto a concrete bench. The man suffered minor scrapes, but declined any medical attention. The suspect is described as a white male, 40 to 50 years old, medium build, approximately 57 in height, with short brown hair and a mustache. According to the victim, the suspect may have been holding a bottle and was likely intoxicated. The Davis Police Department is investigating this case as a hate crime because of the derogatory comment made by the suspect just prior to the attack. Detectives were called out to pursue any possible leads and are actively attempting to identify to the suspect. Anyone with information about this case is urged to contact the Davis Police Department at 530-747-5400.",1,0,0
245,"From the Davis Police Department: On Wednesday, Feb. 4, Davis Police responded to the Hillel House located near the UC Davis campus for a late reported incident of graffiti found etched on the wall in the mens bathroom. The Hillel House is a well-known Jewish organization that is designed to enhance the lives of Jewish students attending schools, including UC Davis. The vandalism is believed to have occurred between Jan. 22 and Jan. 23. The graffiti was discovered last month by a janitor, and is said to have consisted of the phrase grout out the Jews, which was etched into the grout on the tile wall of the mens room in a toilet stall. The Janitor immediately removed the graffiti and only yesterday reported it to staff. According to Hillel staff, the janitor came forward with this information due to the recent reported hate crime graffiti at the AEPi house in Davis.

247,"A former Torrey Pines High School student pleaded guilty Tuesday to posting threats targeting the school on his Instagram account and will spend a minimum of six months in a residential treatment facility. Kevin Gregory Matlak, 21, will be sentenced Aug. 10 by Superior Court Judge Polly Shamoon. He pleaded guilty to one count of making a criminal threat. Matlak will be placed on five years probation and sentenced to a year in custody, which he will be able to serve at the treatment facility. Shamoon told Matlak to become stable on his medications before he is sentenced. Shamoon told Matlak that everyone is worried about him. Nobody wins if you go to prison, Shamoon said. Shamoon allowed Matlaks mother to give him a hug after the plea. Classmates of Matlak who graduated in 2015 reported the threats to law enforcement on May 30, leading to his arrest. Matlak bailed out of jail and voluntarily checked himself in to a lockdown mental health facility, defense attorney Brian Watkins said. Watkins said Matlak didnt threaten anyone directly, but three former classmates read his posts on Instagram and felt threatened by them.

249,"An unfounded threat of widespread violence targeting Los Angeles schools this week made passing mention about supposed plans to spread the mayhem into San Diego, as well, authorities acknowledged today. The anonymous email, sent to Los Angeles Unified School District board members Tuesday, described a supposed scheme to bomb numerous LAUSD campuses and included similarly menacing statements about other Southern California communities and New York. Authorities in San Diego -- who did not receive the threatening message themselves but got word of it secondhand -- investigated and decided that the threats were not credible, but took some added local security steps to be on the safe side, according to city officials. The email, which focused almost entirely on Los Angeles, referred to San Diego in passing, along with other Southern California cities, said Matt Awbrey, spokesman for Mayor Kevin Faulconers office. The San Diego Police Department and San Diego Unified (School District) police did not believe the message posed a credible threat, but in an abundance of caution provided extra patrols at local schools, he said. San Diego law enforcement will continue to coordinate with state and federal officials and remain vigilant. The threat, which prompted daylong closures of more than 900 LAUSD campuses in the nations second-largest school district, did not specifically mention San Diego schools, only the city in general. If you look at the words, its very vague, SDPD public-affairs Lt. Scott Wahl said. According to Los Angeles-based ABC7, which obtained and released the threatening message in its entirety, the email included the following statement: If you cancel classes, the bombings will take place regardless, and we will bring our guns to the streets and offices of Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Bakersfield and San Diego. The email that shut down all of the Los Angeles Unified School District warned of mass killings by bombs, hand guns and assault rifles, according to the full text of the letter reported by several local media outlets Wednesday. ABC7 first reported on the email Wednesday morning, and it was later confirmed by KTLA. The full text of the letter is below: TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN: I am emailing you to inform you of the happenings on Tuesday, 12/15/15. Something big is going down. Something very big. It will make national headlines. Perhaps, even international ones. You see, my last 4 years here at one of the district high schools has been absolute hell. Pure, unmitigated, agony. The bullying, the loneliness, the rejection... it is never-ending. And for what? Just because Im different? No. No more. I am a devout Muslim, and was once against violence, but I have teamed up with a local jihadist cell as it is the only way Ill be able to accomplish my massacre the correct way. I would not be able to do it alone. Me, and my 32 comrades, will die tomorrow in the name of Allah. Every school in the L.A. Unified district is being targeted. We have bombs hidden in lockers already at several schools. They are strategically placed and are meant to crumble the foundations of the very buildings that monger so much hate and discrimination. They are pressure cooker bombs, hidden in backpacks around the schools. They are loaded with 20 lbs. of gunpowder, for maximum damage. They will be detonated via Cell Phone. Not only are there bombs, but there are nerve gas agents set to go off at a specific time: during lunch hour. To top it off, my brothers in Allah and I have Kalashnikov rifles, Glock 18 Machine pistols, and multiple handheld grenades. The students at every school in the L.A. Unified district will be massacred, mercilessly. And there is nothing you can do to stop it. If you do end up trying to, by perhaps, beefing up security, or canceling classes for the day, it wont matter. Your security will not be able to stop us. We are an army of Allah. If you cancel classes, the bombings will take place regardless, and we will bring our guns to the streets and offices of Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Bakersfield, and San Diego. I wish you the best luck. It is time to pray to allah, as this may be your last day. --City News Service contributed to this report",0,8,5
250,"In the wake of a federal finding that police in Ferguson, Missouri, engaged in a pattern of racial bias, a San Diego police lieutenant said Thursday that the department employs ongoing strategies to fight actual and perceived bias in its law enforcement practices -- an effort that is never at an end state. We dont believe that theres an urgent problem (here), SDPD public- affairs Lt. Scott Wahl told City News Service. Its just that (avoiding bias) is an ongoing part of our culture that were always ... keeping in the forefront. Wahl made his comments following the U.S. Department of Justices conclusion this week that the Ferguson Police Department in Missouri has engaged in a widespread pattern of racial bias and constitutional violations, but that the fatal shooting of a black man there by a white officer though a tragedy did not involve prosecutable conduct. The San Diego Police Department is not completely free of race-related problems, as evidenced by a report SDPD Chief Shelley Zimmerman made last month to the citys Public Safety and Livable Neighborhoods Committee on data from traffic stops. According to cards filled out in 2014 by officers about their stops, black motorists accounted for 11 percent of vehicle stops and 23 percent of searches, despite comprising only 5.5 percent of San Diegos population, Zimmerman told the panel. Hispanic drivers made up 30 percent of the stops and 40 percent of the searches, while comprising 27 percent of the population. The comparable rates for whites and Asians were below their population shares. The data showed that the problem exists, according to Mark Jones, a black ex-Marine and leader of the Black Students Justice Coalition. Jones has pushed for changes in SDPD practices in the wake of fatal police shootings of unarmed black men such as the one in Ferguson. The police have to change their culture from within and enforce existing policies, Jones told the council committee. Police officials say officers collected the data early in the last decade but the practice diminished over time. The SDPD resumed the practice late in 2013. Those findings demonstrate the need for police agencies to constantly monitor their dealings with minority groups and other subsets of the communities they serve, according to Wahl. Everybody has bias, and we provide training to our personnel that helps them understand bias and what our personal biases are, and make sure they do not become a part of how we police, he said. Additionally, SDPD personnel attend an average of about 140 community hearings a month, sitting in on meetings of planning groups, town councils, neighborhood-watch organizations and religious congregations, Wahl said. Officers attending such sessions are directed to be receptive to any complaints about racially motivated police misconduct. Also, the department actively searches out such problems in its ranks through the SDPD Professional Standards Unit, according to Wahl. The need to identify and eliminate bias in the department is not a duty that will simply go away, the lieutenant said.  Its never at an end state, he said. Its always something that were addressing and were keeping an eye on. --By City News Service Subscribe via email to Patch Alerts and our Daily Newsletter, and stay in touch with your community and the Patch California regional network.

251,"A one-time San Diego tax attorney and certified public accountant was sentenced today to 5 1/2 years in federal prison for using the identities of deceased children to create aliases that allowed him to evade millions of dollars in taxes. In handing down the punishment for Lloyd Irving Taylor, U.S. District Court Judge Michael Anello also ordered the 71-year-old defendant to pay about $2.2 million in restitution to the Internal Revenue Service. Following a weeklong trial in June, a jury convicted Taylor of 19 felony charges, including aggravated identity theft, making false statements to a financial institution, tax evasion, corrupt interference with the IRS and lying on passport applications. According to prosecutors, Taylor stole the personal information of dead children and used it to obtain fraudulent passports and other identifying documents, which he then used to open and maintain financial accounts so he could hide his income and assets from the IRS. The stolen identities also allowed him to transfer funds between accounts and to buy assets, such as gold coins, as another means of skirting taxes, court documents state. Similarly, Taylor created over a dozen fake churches and opened 31 related bank and investment accounts in their names. He then took advantage of the tax-exempt status of religious institutions to fraudulently claim that hisincome was not subject to federal taxes, according to the U.S. Attorneys Office in San Diego. Among witnesses who testified during the trial was the brother of one of the deceased people whose identity was stolen, as well as an elderly blind woman whose Social Security number was filched by Taylor. Despite working and earning money for over 40 years, Taylor filed federal tax returns just seven times, prosecutors said. All told, he failed to report about $5 million in income, on which he owed the IRS about $1.6 million, according to the U.S. Attorneys Office.",0,8,5
252,"The Los Angeles Police Departments Asian Crime Unit seeks to inform the public about a recent rash of Blessing scams targeting the Asian community; such scams have been seen  before in the San Gabriel Valley.  The victims are contacted by the first suspect, a Chinese female, who claims to be a psychic and offers to tell the victims their fortune free of charge. After the initial contact is made, two additional suspects approach the victims and say that they had their fortune told by the first suspect and that she is someone to take seriously. In one instance, the psychic told a victim that her son would be in a fatal car accident and that to avoid such a tragedy, she should perform a blessing. The primary suspect then asks the victim to gather cash and valuables to be blessed by her. The victims are told that the blessing service is also free and that the victims keep their belongings with them. Once the victims bring their belongings, the prayer service is performed and the victims property is placed inside a bag. Once the victim is distracted, the suspects switch the items for bottles of water. Victims are told not to handle the bag for a few days, or the blessing will be ruined.  Similar crimes were reported about two years ago not only in the City of Los Angeles but also in Monterey Park, Alhambra, San Gabriel, and Temple city. One suspect was arrested and prosecuted in the Los Angeles area for those crimes and no additional crimes were being reported. Early in October of this year, similar crimes were reported in the San Francisco area. Detectives are advising members in the Chinese communities to raise their level of awareness when they come across individuals who claim to be psychics or religious healers. Do not hand over your cash or valuables to anyone offering to bless them. If anyone is contacted by these individuals they should end the encounter and immediately report it to the police.  All the suspects were described as Chinese females who spoke various Chinese dialects and displayed no remarkable physical features.  Detectives are asking anyone with information on this crime to call Detective Ken Yueng, Asian Crime Unit, at 213- 486-5350. During non-business hours or on weekends, calls should be directed to 1-877-LAPD-24-7 (877-527-3247). Anyone wishing to remain anonymous should call Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS (800-222-8477).

253,"- A psychologist at the California Medical Facility at Vacaville has sued the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation for alleged harassment and retaliation because she complained about mistreatment of LGBTQ prisoners. Lori Jespersen, 41, a licensed psychologist who has worked at the Vacaville facility since 2009, sued the CDCR and several officials in federal court in Sacramento on Monday. Her lawsuit contends that she filed numerous complaints about derogatory comments, hostility and harassment of gay and transgender inmates by prison staff members and most of the complaints were ignored. Jespersen also alleges she was subjected to escalating discrimination, harassment and retaliation because of her own gender identity and her advocacy. She identifies herself in the lawsuit as gender-nonconforming, gender-queer and lesbian. She alleges that a hostile correctional officer endangered her life by locking her in a unit without a safety alarm with a serial rapist in December 2014, locking her in with two prisoners in March 2015 and making comments that appeared to solicit violence against her by prisoners. The lawsuit alleges that after she took a month of medical leave in June 2016, Jespersen was put in a desk job where she remains in fear for her safety. The lawsuit asks for an injunction requiring the department to cease the alleged practices and for financial compensation for Jespersen. The legal claims in the case include a hostile work environment, retaliation, discrimination and violation of the right of free speech. CDCR spokeswoman Vicky Waters said she could not comment on the lawsuit because the department does not comment on pending litigation. The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Kimberly Mueller. Jennifer Orthwein, a lawyer for Jespersen, said she did not know how soon there will be a hearing on the case.

254,"- The City of Davis in Yolo County is now offering a reward for the person who broke windows, damaged bicycles and left uncooked pork at a local mosque, resulting in between $5,000 and $10,000 in damage. The citys Hate Crime Reward Fund is offering $1,000 for information leading to the arrest and prosecution of the person who recently vandalized the Davis Islamic Center. The fund was created about 15 years ago with contributions from Davis residents when there was a rise of anti-Muslim incidents in an East Davis residential area. The citys $1,000 reward is in addition to a $1,000 reward being offered by the Sacramento branch of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, or CAIR, a Muslim civil liberties and advocacy organization.

255,"- Windows were shattered, bicycles were damaged and strips of pork were left at a mosque in Davis over the weekend, leading police to investigate what may be a hate crime. On Jan. 22, Davis Police officers responded to the Davis Islamic Center regarding a reported vandalism.

258,"Dublin police arrested a 15-year-old Dublin High School student in connection with an assault of another student that occurred at the school in October, police said Friday. Police have not released the identity of the student arrested. The arrest stemmed from an investigation into the assault of a 14-year-old female student that occurred on Oct. 23. The student arrested is male. Police said the 15-year-old and the 14-year-old were engaged in a fight stemming from a racial slur made by another student. The female student started the fight. The male student was arrested, processed and released to his parents, who declined to press charges against the female student. On Thursday, a 20-year-old former Dublin High School student was arrested for allegedly threatening to blow up the school because she was upset about a social media article she saw about the assault. Taylor Mychelle Pearson told police she called in the bomb threat to the school because she was upset about how the investigation into the incident was being handled.

259,"The Alameda County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Tuesday to continue supporting the Sheriffs Offices controversial Urban Shield first-responder training exercise despite fierce opposition by a wide range of activist groups. The boards 5-0 vote came at the end of a five-hour hearing during which several speakers accused Sheriff Gregory Ahern of being a liar and he angrily responded, Dont call me a liar! Board President Scott Haggerty struggled to maintain order at the packed hearing in the boards chambers at the county administration building and at one point he threatened to clear the room unless people calmed down. Board members said they share the concerns that were expressed by most of the approximately 100 speakers about Urban Shield being an event that increases the militarization of law enforcement officers. But they said they believe that Ahern has put in adequate safeguards to make sure that the annual Urban Shield training program bans racial profiling, excludes vendors who display derogatory or racist messages and excludes the sale or transfer of assault weapons and firearms. As part of its vote, the board included an amendment by Supervisor Keith Carson to form an 18-member panel of community members, health officials and educational officials that will address the communitys concerns about the Urban Shield. The event, which is held every September, used to take place in Oakland but was moved to the Alameda County Fairgrounds in Pleasanton in 2015 after former Oakland Mayor Jean Quan said she no longer wanted to have it held in her city. It provides training for natural disasters as well as man-made disasters such as explosions, mass shootings and terrorism. Supervisor Richard Valle said he believes the training program, which is the nations largest first-responder exercise and includes law enforcement agencies from across the country and the world, is beneficial, if controversial, and I believe were moving in the right direction. Supervisor Wilma Chan told Urban Shield opponents, Youve had more impact on us than you think and that their concerns prompted Ahern to impose guidelines to ensure that the event wont include surveillance training or crowd control training. Supervisor Nate Miley said he thinks some of Urban Shields opponents are naïve and said the event is necessary because, We have to live in the world as it is, and its a dangerous, dangerous world that includes terrorism. At a rally before the hearing, members of the Stop Urban Shield Coalition said they oppose the training event because it is a U.S. Department of Homeland Security-funded program that has received national and international condemnation for its role in training and arming police with military style weapons, tactics, and technologies, and for featuring violent and racist propaganda. Lara Kiswani of the Arab Resource and Organizing Center said she opposes the program because she believes Ahern is interested in further militarizing our communities. Mohamed Shehk of Critical Resistance said, Urban Shield isnt just about policing in the Bay Area, its about policing throughout the United States and the world. Shehk alleged that the program teaches aggressive tactics that are used to oppress people in Mexico, Palestine and other locations around the world. The boards vote authorizes the county to accept $5.5 million in Urban Shield Area Security Initiative funds for emergency preparedness for a 15-month period ending in early 2018. In a separate but related action that was also opposed by many of the same people who oppose Urban Shield, the Board of Supervisors voted unanimously to approve spending $650,000 to hire an architectural firm to provide architectural and engineering services for a new mental health facility for inmates at the countys Santa Rita Jail in Dublin. Tash Nguyen of the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights in Oakland said she opposes the funding because she thinks jail officials are doing a poor of treating inmates with mental health problems because a high percentage of those inmates wind up back in jail after theyre released. Nguyen said, Mental healthcare is far more effective and best delivered outside of a jail setting. Nguyen said, While much-needed resources are continuing to be cut for community services, the sheriff is pushing the county toward wasting funding toward bigger jails. Chan said, Everyone agrees that people with mental health issues get better treatment outside prison but she said those who are in custody should get the best treatment possible. Miley said, The people who are in jail should have the dignity of getting the best services they can get. Several speakers called on the board not to spend $61 million on the new mental health facility at the Santa Rita Jail but Carson said the board already approved the facility last June and Chan pointed out that most of that money will come from the state. Chan said 10 percent of the funding will come from the Sheriffs Office and none of it will come from the countys general fund.

261,"Buffalo Wild Wings and four black men settled the plaintiffs lawsuit alleging that a white server at the Palmdale restaurant made a remark with racist undertones before demanding that they pay or produce a credit card before she would serve them. Lawyers for DeAndre L. Predom, Terrance Berry, Terry Brown and Darryl P. Douglas filed court papers Tuesday with Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Rita Miller stating that the case was resolved. Gary Rand and Suzanne E. Rand-Lewis, the lawyers for the four men, released a statement today confirming the settlement, adding they could not comment on the terms. However, we commend our clients for bringing to light longstanding issues in the region, the statement read. We have previously handled other cases involving multiple African-American individuals who were racially profiled at restaurants in the Palmdale-Lancaster area. African Americans were required to pay for food service in advance. In our opinion, this is an institutionalized racist practice which seems to have pervaded the region. The events alleged in the complaint occurred three days after the Aug. 9, 2014, death in Ferguson, Mo., of Michael Brown, a young black man, by Darren Wilson, a white police officer, the statement read. Given the worldwide spotlight on the issue of racial profiling, we hope what appears to be a wide spread practice of racial profiling in this region has lessened, the statement read. A BWW representative did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment. The suit, filed Jan. 20, named the server, Michelle Rossi, and the restaurants manager, Isaac Duran, in addition to Buffalo Wild Wings. According to the lawsuit, the four men went to the restaurant on 10th Street on Aug. 12, 2014, and waited until a table was available. After being seated, Rossi approached and took their drink orders, the suit stated. Predom asked for a beer and his companions requested water, but Rossi told them they had to pay or give her a credit card before she would serve them, according to the lawsuit. The plaintiffs, surprised at the request, asked for an explanation, the suit stated. Rossi allegedly replied: Im not going to pay for anybodys meal. Ive had you people run out on me before. After Berry told the server they did not feel comfortable paying in advance, Rossi became upset and walked away in an aggressive manner, the suit stated. Reluctant to believe they were being treated different because of their race, the four went to guests at other tables to ask if similar demands were made of them, according to the suit. The customers at these tables, all of whom were Caucasian, not of color, advised plaintiffs they had not been requested to do so, the complaint stated. The four then complained to Duran, who told them Rossi was adhering to BWW policy and refused to do anything, the suit stated. But after the four told the manager that white guests said they were not treated the same way, Duran apologized and offered them gift cards, which they declined, according to the lawsuit. The four, upset at how they were treated, then left the restaurant, the suit stated.  The alleged discrimination against the plaintiffs contradicts BWW representations to customers that the restaurant chain wants to WOW people every day and for customers to receive the highest level of satisfaction with an extraordinary focus on friendly service, food, fun and value, according to their court papers. --City News Service",1,0,3
262,"Photo via Creative Commons The chief of the USC Department of Public Safety said he was deeply disturbed to hear allegations that the son of actress Taraji P. Henson was racially profiled by police at the campus, prompting him to attend a different college. Henson, who stars in the hit series Empire, said in an interview with Uptown magazine that her son Marcel, 20, was hoping to attend USC. But while on campus, he was stopped by police because he had his hands in his pockets, Henson said. USC police Chief John Thomas said he did not know if any of his officers were involved in the alleged stop, but he planned to investigate. I was deeply disturbed to read about a prospective student who felt profiled on or near campus because of his race, Thomas said. I would like to look into this matter further and better understand who was involved and what took place. As someone who personally experienced racial profiling as a teenager, I have a stake in learning more about this incident and doing all I can to reach a just resolution.

263,"The head of the Los Angles Police Commission -- the police departments civilian bosses -- says in remarks reported Monday that the nonprofit group of business leaders who attended an LAPD-organized event featuring a convicted ex-shot caller for the Mexican Mafia has approached police officials with an offer to reimburse the departments costs. Police Commission President Steve Soboroff told the Los Angeles Times that the Young Presidents Organization contacted him about reaching out to the department for an invoice for any and all expenses stemming from the security provided at Wednesdays event in downtown L.A. I think thats a positive step, Soboroff said. But that doesnt mean the inspector general shouldnt look at the other issues -- why it happened in the first place. And hes doing that. The LAPD has been criticized for coordinating the meeting between business leaders, local police officials and Rene Boxer Enriquez, a former shot caller with the prison gang who was sentenced to life in prison for two murders. The LAPD has not said how many officers were used and how much the event cost the department. But Times reporters saw a heavy police presence around the building, including several unmarked police cars, a police helicopter overhead and officers searching a nearby coffee shop with a police dog.  Soboroff has called the meeting as a giant waste of public resources. A spokesman for Mayor Eric Garcetti also criticized the department over the event. --City News Service Also on Patch: UPDATED: Gangsta Rap Impresario Suge Knight Facing Murder Charge Latino Who Allegedly Stabbed 2 in Covina Hate Crime Due in Court Delta Will Fly Larger Planes on Shuttle From LAX to San Francisco San Diego State University Sending Wine Program Abroad",0,8,5
264,"The Los Angeles Police Departments Asian Crime Unit seeks to inform the public about a recent rash of Blessing scams targeting the Chinese community.  The victims are contacted by the first suspect, a Chinese female, who claims to be a psychic and offers to tell the victims their fortune free of charge. After the initial contact is made, two additional suspects approach the victims and say that they had their fortune told by the first suspect and that she is someone to take seriously. In one instance, the psychic told a victim that her son would be in a fatal car accident and that to avoid such a tragedy, she should perform a blessing. The primary suspect then asks the victim to gather cash and valuables to be blessed by her. The victims are told that the blessing service is also free and that the victims keep their belongings with them. Once the victims bring their belongings, the prayer service is performed and the victims property is placed inside a bag. Once the victim is distracted, the suspects switch the items for bottles of water. Victims are told not to handle the bag for a few days, or the blessing will be ruined.  Similar crimes were reported about two years ago not only in the City of Los Angeles but also in Monterey Park, Alhambra, San Gabriel, and Temple city. One suspect was arrested and prosecuted in the Los Angeles area for those crimes and no additional crimes were being reported. Early in October of this year, similar crimes were reported in the San Francisco area. Detectives are advising members in the Chinese communities to raise their level of awareness when they come across individuals who claim to be psychics or religious healers. Do not hand over your cash or valuables to anyone offering to bless them. If anyone is contacted by these individuals they should end the encounter and immediately report it to the police.  All the suspects were described as Chinese females who spoke various Chinese dialects and displayed no remarkable physical features.  Detectives are asking anyone with information on this crime to call Detective Ken Yueng, Asian Crime Unit, at 213- 486-5350.

265,"A Los Angeles Police Department Board of Rights recommended the firing of a detective who once fatally shot a fellow officer during a traffic dispute and more recently was accused of making racially charged comments at a training class about shooting black men, it was reported today. The LA Weekly, citing an anonymous department source, reported on its website that the board has recommended the termination of Detective Frank Lyga. The recommendation now moves to LAPD Chief Charlie Beck, who will decide whether to fire Lyga. Lyga was assigned to home duty with pay in June. LAPD internal affairs investigators opened an inquiry into the 57-year- old Lyga after a fellow officer filed a complaint against him for the comments he allegedly made while teaching a class at the departments training academy, Cmdr. Andy Smith said this summer. The investigation has centered on an audio recording allegedly capturing Lygas comments to a training class. A copy of the recording was released publicly by Jasmyne Cannick, a political consultant and writer. Cannick said the recording was made by a black officer who attended the class Lyga taught last November. On the recording, a man gives a rambling, expletive-laden talk that revolves mostly around Lygas 1997 fatal shooting of Kevin Gaines, an off-duty LAPD officer. According to police accounts of the shooting, Lyga was working an undercover narcotics operation when he became involved in a traffic dispute with Gaines. Apparently, neither man knew the other was a police officer. The shooting sparked racial tensions within the department because Gaines was black and Lyga is white. In recounting the LAPDs investigation into the shooting and the lawsuit Gaines family filed, the man on the recording complains he was unfairly labeled as a racist killer. He also recalled a confrontation he had with attorney Carl Douglas, who helped represent Gaines family in their lawsuit. Douglas, the man said, asked him if he believed all young black men were gang members and if he regretted shooting Gaines, the Los Angeles Times reported. I said, No. I regret he was alone in the truck at the time, the man said he replied. I could have killed a whole truckload of them and I would have been happy doing so. NBC4 reported that in a brief interview with Lyga, the detective acknowledged making the comments and expressed regret but claimed his words had been taken out of context.",1,0,3
266,"Two Highland Park gang members have been charged with murdering a 19-year-old Eagle Rock resident, and homicide detectives of the Los Angeles Police Department Northeast Division are searching for any additional witnesses to the recent Veterans Day crime that sent shock waves in the community. We have been working on the case from the second it came out and had a possible I.D. of the suspects within a day, Northeast Division Capt. Jeff Bert told Highland Park-Mount Washington Patch, adding that the Los Angeles District Attorneys office charged the suspected killers this past Friday. The two gang members are Latino residents of Highland Park, Bert said, declining to identify their gang affiliation. Both the suspects very clearly match witnesses accounts of two assailants who had tattoos on their faces, Bert said. Andrew Michaels Sittiams was stabbed to death while walking with a friend in broad daylight on Nov. 11 on the 7100 block of North Figueroa Street, near Highland Parks border with Eagle Rock. According to some witness accounts, one of the gang members got into an argument with Sittiams after asking him which gang he was from, LAPD Sgt. Lisa Philips, a watch commander, told Patch earlier. Although Sittiams was African American and was not a gang member, his murder is being investigated as a gang-related crime instead of as a possible hate crime. It is LAPD policy that anytime a suspect in a crime is a gang member or the victim is a gang member—or any combination thereof—the crime is considered gang-related, Bert explained, adding: So if gang members shoot an old lady, for example, thats a gang crime. Besides, there is no indication that Sittiams was targeted because of his race, Bert said. The gang we are looking at has black members, the captain explained. Its not like other gangs in Los Angeles, such as the Canoga Park Alabama (CPA) in the Topanga Division, which targets Blacks. Turf gang members work through fear and intimidation and are more inclined to challenge young people instead of older folk, Bert said. Asked if witnesses to the murder of Sittiams were inclined to cooperate in the investigation and prosecution of the suspects, Bert said: Im not going to go that far. Bert also said he was not at liberty to disclose what the witnesses have told detectives about the crime. Meanwhile, the LAPD is still looking for any leads to the drive-by shooting in July of two gang members on Cypress Avenue in Glassell Park, Bert said. The gang members were evidently shot to death by members of a rival gang because they were tagging the rival gangs territory in Cypress Park. Another gang-related murder that remains unresolved is the May 28, 2013 shooting of Ernesto Ramirez, 21, on Benner Street in Highland Park. Ramirez was shot to death multiple times while standing outside a house where his relatives live in an area known to be a stronghold of the Avenues gang. Although Ramirez was a documented gang member, the LAPD believes his killing was neither tied to his gang affiliation nor part of retaliatory gang warfare. We do have some good leads in the case, Bert said. But its difficult getting witnesses to come forward because of fear of gang retaliation, Bert said.",1,0,0

269,"Three gang members agreed Thursday to plead guilty to federal civil rights and racketeering violations for firebombing the homes of black residents in the Boyle Heights area four years ago in an effort to drive them out of the defendants Latino gang territory. Jose Lil Moe Saucedo, 24, Edwin Boogie Felix, 26, and Jonathan Pelon Portillo, 23, admitted in plea agreements that they targeted the apartments in the Ramona Gardens housing complex because of the occupants race and color. In the early morning hours of May 12, 2014, eight members of the Big Hazard street gang, which claims Ramona Gardens as its territory, prepared Molotov cocktails, smashed the windows of four apartments and threw the lit firebombs into the units, according to the U.S. Attorneys Office. Three of the four targeted apartments were occupied by black families, including women and children, who were sleeping at the time of the unprovoked attack, federal prosecutors said. It was a miracle that no one was injured in these racially motivated attacks, said U.S. Attorney Nicola T. Hanna. These defendants have admitted their goal was to drive African Americans out of this housing facility. This simply will not be tolerated, and we will take any and all steps necessary to protect the civil rights of every person who lives in the United States. All three defendants agreed to plead guilty to racketeering and conspiring to violate the civil rights of the families, specifically the constitutional right to live in a home free from injury, intimidation and interference based on race. They will also plead to using force to injure, intimidate and interfere with the residents because of their race, according to their plea documents. Additionally, Portillo agreed to plead guilty to a charge of using fire to commit another federal felony, and Saucedo and Felix will plead to a charge of attempted malicious damage of federal property through the use of fire. Once they enter their guilty pleas on a date to be determined, all three will face potential sentences of at least 30 years in federal prison. Three other members of the Big Hazard gang who were charged in the case -- Francisco Bones Farias, 27, Joel Matthew Gallo Monarrez, 23, and Jose Fresco Zamora, 28 -- previously pleaded guilty to federal hate crimes and related offenses, and are awaiting sentencing in Los Angeles federal court. The final two defendants -- Carlos Rider Hernandez, 33, and Josue Malo Garibay, 24, are facing trial before U.S. District Judge Christina A. Snyder on July 31. According to an indictment unsealed in summer 2016, Hernandez ordered the other defendants to meet at a location in Hazard gang territory on May 11, 2014 -- Mothers Day -- to prepare for the nights attack. At the meeting, Hernandez allegedly distributed materials to be used during the firebombing, including disguises, gloves and other materials. Hernandez explained that the order for the racially motivated attack had come from the Mexican Mafia, a prison gang that controls the majority of Hispanic gangs in Southern California, prosecutors allege. The indictment also alleges that Hernandez told the other defendants to break the victims windows, allowing the Molotov cocktails to make a clean entry, ignite the firebombs, and throw them into the victims units in order to maximize damage. One of the victims, a mother sleeping on her couch with her infant child in her arms, narrowly missed being struck by one of the weapons. The innocent victims of this cold-blooded attack were targeted based on the color of their skin, said Paul D. Delacourt, the assistant director in charge of the FBIs Los Angeles field office. Im proud of the agents, detectives and prosecutors who identified the defendants and continue to investigate this very challenging case. These plea agreements are the first step in delivering justice to the victims, as well as delivering the universal message that there is no place for racially motivated hatred or violence in the United States.

270,"Police arrested a 25-year-old man suspected of terrorizing Los Angeles County with a string of church fires, authorities announced Friday. The Inter-Agency House of Worship Task Force set up to investigate the fires arrested Christian Michael Garcia Thursday on suspicion of arson and vandalism. LAs faith community celebrated the news just days after the latest two fires that damaged Pasadenas historic Church of the Angels and Resurrection Church Thursday in Boyle Heights. City Councilman Jose Huizar, who represents Boyle Heights and other Eastside communities, thanked the LAFD Arson Unit, the LAPD, Pasadena police and fire agencies for their remarkable work and expediency in ensuring the person responsible for these and other heinous crimes will be held accountable. Monsignor (John) Moretta and Resurrection Church have stood time and time again for Boyle Heights, and Boyle Heights will always stand for Resurrection Church, Huizar said. We applaud these investigators and we look forward to assisting Resurrection Church rebuild knowing that the true spirit of this parish can never be destroyed. The blazes drew widespread attention as they targeted houses of worship deeply connected to the community. Authorities allege Garcia is also connected to multiple other acts of arson and vandalism that have occurred at houses of worship in Los Angeles County. Thursdays fire was reported at 2:05 a.m. at the church in the 3300 block of East Opal Street. It took about five dozen firefighters nearly a half- hour to extinguish. The fire was primarily centered on the first floor of the church, and the flames were kept from the main sanctuary, said Los Angeles Fire Department Capt. Erik Scott. The Pasadena fire at Church of the Angels broke out at 2:20 a.m. Jan. 13 at 1100 N. Avenue 64. The blaze at the 129-year-old Episcopalian church was classified as a hate crime, according to Lisa Dederian of the Pasadena Fire Department. A few historic statues were significantly damaged, and there was fire and smoke damage inside the church, she said. The Collaboration of our Federal and local partners and the tireless work of investigators from the various agencies in the task force, made this arrest possible and is a testament to the productive working relationship, first responders have here in Southern California when a community is threatened by criminal activity, said Pasadena Fire Chief Bertral Washington and Pasadena Police chief Philip Sanchez. The case against Garcia will be presented to the Los Angeles County District Attorneys Office on Monday for prosecution, authorities said. Arson and vandalism targeting houses of worship is a serious crime and we have zero-tolerance for willful acts of destruction in the City of Los Angeles, said LAFD Chief Ralph Terrazas and LAPD Chief Charlie Beck said in a written announcement. The destruction of a house of worship not only devastates the affected congregation, but affects the entire community. We will always investigate and prosecute the serious crime of arson to the fullest extent of the law. City News Service contributed to this report. File Photo by AP Photo/Jonathan Chandia",1,3,1
271,"- An Echo Park native who killed a young woman during a rape in Glendale 37 years ago was sentenced Friday to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Curtis B. Rappe imposed the term on Darrel Mark Gurule, now 58, who was convicted Sept. 28 of first-degree murder for the September 1979 shooting death of 23-year-old Barbara Ballman. The panel also found true the special circumstance allegations of murder during the commission of a rape and murder with a prior conviction, but deadlocked on a third special circumstance allegation -- murder during the course of a robbery. Jurors also deadlocked in the trials penalty phase on Oct. 13, with 10 members of the panel favoring a life prison sentence without the possibility of parole and two voting for a death sentence. The prosecution announced Dec. 2 that it would no longer pursue the death penalty against Gurule. Ballmans naked body was found in the early morning hours of Sept. 21, 1979, inside her Volkswagen sedan parked across from Edison Elementary School. Ballman was killed Sept. 20, 1979, some time after leaving her older sisters home. Linda Benjamin told jurors that her sister moved to California after she did. I hate that she ... was murdered on my watch, Benjamin told jurors in Gurules trial, reading from a journal she kept after her sister was killed. Gurule was charged with Ballmans murder in 2010 after DNA evidence linked him to the killing, authorities said. Glendale police said semen was recovered from the victim, who had been shot in the abdomen, but DNA analysis was not available at the time. When Glendale police re-opened an investigation into Ballmans killing and submitted the semen evidence to the Los Angeles County Sheriffs Departments crime lab, a match was made with Gurules DNA, police said. Gurule -- who was 19 at the time of the killing -- was already serving a life prison sentence for the 1987 kidnap-murder of Roberto Bruno when he was charged with Ballmans murder. Detectives believe Bruno was shot to death as the result of a drug deal gone wrong. Deputy District Attorney Jonathan Chung told jurors earlier this year that witnesses and transcripts show that Gurule also kidnapped and sexually assaulted another woman in 1977, assaulted two brothers in 1979, robbed a man in 1982 and received stolen goods in 1986. One of Gurules attorneys, Philip Peng, told the jury that his client grew up in Echo Park in the 1960s and 70s, when the area was controlled by warring gangs, and called Gurules father an extremely vicious man with heavy hands, who regularly beat his wife and their eight children.

274,"Two Texas men have been sentenced to three years in state prison after they pleaded no contest Thursday to felony assault and a hate crime enhancement for a 2016 attack in Richmond, according to Contra Costa County District Attorney Mark Peterson. Chase Little and Colton Leblanc were accused of attacking Maan Singh Khalsa, a Richmond resident and observer of the Sikh faith, prosecutors said. On Sept. 25, Khalsa was stopped at a red light at Hilltop Road, dressed in traditional Sikh clothes and on his way to a religious ceremony when Little and Leblanc started throwing beer cans at his vehicle, prosecutors said. The two men then exited their pickup truck, repeatedly punched the victim in the face, removed his turban and cut his unshorn hair, a sacred article of his faith, prosecutors said. During the assault, Khalsa suffered a swollen black eye, damaged teeth and several knife wounds to his left hand. One of the wounds required stitches, and due to an infection from the knife wound, Khalsas pinky finger had to be amputated. — Bay City News; Image via Shutterstock Also See:",1,3,0
275,"A Richmond man identifying as Sikh was attacked Sept. 25 in what he describes as a violent hate crime, the Sikh Coalition said Friday. Maan Singh Khalsa, 41, was driving home from work at 9 p.m. when he was stopped at a red light near Hilltop Mall Drive in Richmond, half a mile from his home, according to the Sikh Coalition. A man in a white Ford F-150 threw a beer can at Khalsas car, unprovoked by Khalsa. Khalsa rolled down his window and saw five or six white men in their late 20s or early 30s in the Ford. The men began swearing at him, and Khalsa called 911. Three men approached his car, attacking him through the open window, knocking off his Sikh turban and hitting him in the face, according to the Sikh Coalition. Khalsas assailants reportedly shouted Cut his hair, yanked his head through the car window by the hair, and cut his hair with a knife. Sikhs do not cut their hair as a religious mandate. The shouts are audible on the 911 call recording, according to the Sikh Coalition. Khalsa needed stitches on the cuts on his fingers and hands. He also had a swollen black eye, and will have to get root canals due to dental damage sustained in the attack, according to the Sikh Coalition. Two suspects have been arrested. A third assailant and two remaining accomplices have not been apprehended. Khalsa is a U.S. citizen and has lived in Contra Costa County for seven years, according to the Sikh Coalition. No one should have to experience the fear of being targeted or attacked based on their identity or for practicing their religion, Richmond Mayor Tom Butt said in a statement. In Richmond, we cherish the various cultures and backgrounds that contribute to our great diversity. I know the people of Richmond will respond to this incident in any way they can to lend support and show solidarity with the Sikh community, Butt said. Gurdwara Shaib, the Sikh house of worship in nearby El Sobrante, has a congregation of more than 5,000 members. One in 10 Bay Area Sikhs surveyed in 2010 reported being the victim of a hate crime, and 68 percent of these were physical attacks, according to the Sikh Coalition.

276,"RICHMOND, CA- A Bay Area man serving a 19-year federal prison sentence for possessing 127.7 grams of cocaine base in Minnesota had his sentenced commuted by President Barack Obama today along with 57 other inmates. Obama has now commuted more than 300 federal prison sentences, including for many drug offenders who were sentenced under what the administration has called outdated and unduly harsh sentencing laws. Today Obama set an expiration date of May 5, 2018, for the prison sentence of Jacob George Colbert of Richmond, according to the White House. Following a guilty plea to conspiracy to distribute in excess of 50 grams of cocaine base in federal court in Minnesota, Colbert was sentenced to 19 years and 7 months in prison followed by five years of supervised release. His sentence came under federal sentencing guidelines in place since the 1980s that mandated sentences for crack cocaine offenses 100 times as severe as those for powder cocaine. In 2010, Obama signed legislation lowering that discrepancy to 18 times, but because Colbert was labeled a career offender due to three prior drug felony convictions he was not eligible for a reduced sentence, according to a 2015 order by U.S. District Judge Donovan Frank. In a 2014 handwritten letter to Frank pleading for a sentence reduction, Colbert wrote, I grew up in the Bay Area of Northern California, pretty much a life of crime and drug selling and usage my whole life, I have never been a violent person or hardcore criminal. But I was into the life of addiction. Addicted to drugs, mainly crack cocaine, so my thing that made sense to me back then was if I was to sell crack then I will always have it for my personal use and now in the long run my years of crack use have led me to this 19-year 7-month drug sentence, Colbert wrote. Colbert, 43 at the time, said he had been taking numerous classes while in prison, including on real estate, sports, personal training, philosophy, crocheting, driving, computer tech, parenting and yoga. Your honor, Im older now, I have grandkids now and I just want to get to them as soon as possible and raise them and bring them up the right way while they are still young, he wrote. I got set up to go out to Minnesota from California on a bus and was promised some money, crack and a truck. I took my chances and here I sit with almost a 20-year sentence. In no way am I violent, I was hurting myself more than anything or anyone else from using crack cocaine. But I have learned I dont never want to see no crack no more. Its all over Ill never use again never. He acknowledged he had prior convictions, mainly for petty offenses like having crack and marijuana on him when he was pulled over. He said the amounts were for personal use, but he ended up being charged for sales. Frank denied Colberts request for a sentence reduction, finding the court lacked the authority under federal guidelines. The laws Colbert was sentenced under have been widely criticized as unjust and contributing to racial disparities in U.S. prisons. While the 2010 Fair Sentencing Act lowered the disparity between crack and powder cocaine offenses from 100 to 18 times, the American Civil Liberties Union called it a compromise that still reflects discredited assumptions about crack cocaine. While Obama has pledged to continue commuting sentences, he has also called for continued criminal justice reform. Clemency of individual cases alone cannot fix decades of overly punitive sentencing policies, White House counsel Neil Eggleston wrote in March, when Obama commuted 61 sentences. So while we continue to work to resolve as many clemency applications as possible -- and make no mistake, we are working hard at this -- only broader criminal justice reform can truly bring justice to the many thousands of people behind bars serving unduly harsh and outdated sentences, Eggleston wrote.

278,"A Richmond man was charged today for making threats to Muslims after police found a possible explosive device in his possession and arrested him Sunday, according to Contra Costa County District Attorneys officials. William Celli, 55, pleaded not guilty in a Richmond courtroom to a charge of making a criminal threat with a hate crime enhancement as well as a charge that he attempted to violate the free exercise of civil rights, District Attorney Derek Butts said. Detectives on Sunday served a search warrant at Cellis home in the 5100 block of McBryde Avenue after receiving a tip on Thursday that he may have manufactured explosive devices and planned to harm the communitys Muslims, police said. Police said a possible homemade explosive device was found at his home, prompting neighboring residents to be evacuated at about 2 p.m. Sunday. A bomb squad then detonated the device and no one was harmed. Richmond Mayor Tom Butt said in a statement today that he (commended) the Richmond Police Department for their work in stopping what could have been a tragic attack in our community. He said he was very grateful no one was hurt and that efforts will be supported to stop any individual or group that seeks to terrorize or harm our residents. Butt added, Clearly, this threat had been influenced by the hateful and divisive rhetoric that is being used on a national level by presidential candidates. He was referencing Cellis Facebook posts, in which he expresses support for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and says he would follow Trump to the end of the world. Among other political tirades, Celli opined on Facebook that Hispanics coming to my country under false pretenses ... need to go back home. He also spoke of an influx of Muslims to the U.S., saying, Kiss your Christian asses goodbye. And all other non-believers of the Koran. The San Francisco Bay Area chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations has called for federal charges for Celli, as well as increased security at mosques and an overall rejection of anti-Muslim political rhetoric.

Religious leaders, elected officials and community members from around the Sacramento region embraced the areas Sikh community at an interfaith service Wednesday as members of that faith struggle to deal with . Why are we the target? We dont understand, said Darshan Mundy, a public relations officer for the West Sacramento temple. The whole community is confused. Representatives from Christian, Catholic, Mormon, Muslim and Jewish faiths spoke to the crowd, offering condolences and pledging support for the Sikh community. It is a religion that promotes peace and promotes love, said Jon Fish, president of the Interfaith Council of Greater Sacramento. Whenever something tragic happens we have to focus a little clearer on peace and on love. Rabbi Nancy Wechsler-Azen of Carmichaels also added her support for the Wisconsin victims. Every soul is a holy soul, she said. Elk Grove City Council Member Sophia Scherman said the Oak Creek tragedy opened up wounds we thought were beginning to heal .

280,"More than 2,000 miles across the country, a community spent Sunday wondering the same thing many Elk Grove residents struggled with last year: Why had some of its peaceful community members been shot dead? In Oak Creek, Wis., six people at a Sikh temple were killed by a gunman who was eventually shot and killed by police. . As of Sunday night, a motive is not known . Bobbie Singh-Allen, an Elk Grove resident who described herself as a leader in the Sikh community, said shes sure both were hate crimes. She said her 10 and 12-year-old sons are afraid. The underlying premise is still the same [in both shootings], Singh-Allen said. You have a bunch of ignorant, racist people out there who are still profiling Sikhs and making horrible assumptions of who we are as a community. Violence and discrimination against peopled perceived to be Arab, Muslim, Sikh, and South Asian spiked following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. I cant think of a worse hate crime than targeting innocent people who are going about their daily life, Singh-Allen said. She encouraged Sikh men to wear their turbans proudly despite the Wisconsin shooting, and said she hoped local schools would do more to educate young students about different religions. Amar Shergill, a West Sacramento attorney who is a board member of that citys Sikh temple and the American Sikh Political Action Committee, said he was shocked to hear about the Oak Creek killings. When I heard about it this morning I had the breath taken out of me, Shergill said. in a lot of ways it was similar to what happened in Elk Grove last year. Both incidents strike at the heart of the Sikh community. He blamed attacks against Sikhs on ignorance, saying while the Sikh community had done a lot to reach out and educate others, that effort would move faster if the nations leaders stepped forward to help. President Barack Obama issued a statement Sunday with condolences for the victims, and said we are reminded how much our country has been enriched by Sikhs, who are a part of our broader American family. Locally, Shergill said Elk Grove City Council Members Steve Detrick and Sophia Scherman have been longtime friends of the Sikh community and .

287,"Its been more than six months since while they were out walking in their Elk Grove neighborhood, and police have turned up few leads besides a description of a car seen in the area at the time of the attack. On Sunday, hoping to entice a witness to come forward, community members will hold a Day of Action to spread the word about the unsolved shooting of the two elderly Sikh men. Volunteers will gather at 9:45 a.m. at the scene of the shooting, the intersection of East Stockton Blvd and Geneva Pointe Dr, and then fan out to stores and neighborhoods to hand out information about rewards offered in the case. The intent is to bring increased awareness to the crimes, Amar Shergill, an attorney with the South Asian Community and Culture Political Action Committee, said in a statement announcing the event. Somewhere, there is a witness with information that can help bring justice for the victims families and the community. Sikh leaders also hope the community action will help put pressure on Gov. Jerry Brown to grant a request made by the for an additional $50,000 reward in the case. The funds would come from a special Governors Reward Program for unsolved crimes, and would join $52,000 already raised by grassroots groups and law enforcement. Shergill said a coalition of community organizations wrote a letter to Brown Oct. 6 urging him to approve the request, but have not yet received a response. Police have raised the possibility that the March 4 shooting was a hate crime, as Atwal and Singh—both originally from the Indian state of Punjab—were wearing religious turbans at the time. Singh, 65, died that day from his injuries, and Atwal, 78, . Anyone with information about the murders can leave an anonymous tip with Crime Alerts at 916-443-HELP or www.crimealerts.org.

288,"(Bobbies in the Midlands District of England already trying out the body cameras - Photo via Flickr Creative Commons) The San Diego County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously this week to begin taking bids for cameras that sheriffs deputies can wear on their uniforms. Law enforcement agencies in the San Diego region and across the country are starting to acquire the cameras so that officers can record interactions with the public. Sheriff Bill Gore wrote in his proposal that the devices, sometimes called body-worn cameras, increase accountability on the part of both officers and the public. Many agencies that use cameras have seen improvement in officer performance as well as the conduct of the community members who are recorded. This is a partnership, Gore said. The whole purpose is to increase that trust between law enforcement and the communities we serve. Crime scene recordings can provide investigators, prosecutors and juries with detailed, accurate and compelling evidence, and could be used in training sessions, he said. Outfitting the departments personnel with the cameras and accessories is expected to cost more than $1 million a year, not including the cost of storing the recordings electronically, according to the sheriff. Gores proposal calls for staff to solicit bids from companies for demonstration systems; a vendor would be selected after testing. Policies and procedures regarding the cameras would be vetted before they are field-tested, he said. I think this is a great balance between protecting our deputy sheriffs and maintaining the strong trust we have throughout the county, Supervisor Dave Roberts said. The San Diego Police Department has been outfitting hundreds of its officers with the cameras for nearly a year now. The SDPDs decision to purchase the devices stemmed from a series of embarrassing incidents in which officers either abused, or were accused of abusing, members of the public. One of those officers was sentenced to prison for soliciting sexual favors from women he pulled over for alleged drunken driving in the Gaslamp Quarter. Another was jailed after being convicted of illegally detaining four women while on duty. Police officials are also hoping that the presence of cameras will deter confrontations that lead to controversial shootings like those in New York and Ferguson, Missouri, that sparked nationwide protests, and reduce complaints of alleged racial profiling during vehicle stops. The body cameras are extremely helpful, SDPD Chief Shelley Zimmerman said last week. Were also hearing from our Independent Citizens Review Board on Police Practices that theyre finding the body cameras are very beneficial to finding out exactly what happened (in incidents that led to a complaint). She said she would provide initial statistics on the cameras at a City Council committee meeting later this month.",0,8,5
289,"A frequent City Hall critic arrested last year after submitting a comment card containing Ku Klux Klan imagery and a racial slur is now facing a criminal charge of illegally possessing an assault rifle, the Los Angeles City Attorneys Office confirmed Thursday. Wayne Spindler, a 47-year-old lawyer who lives in Encino, faces up to a year in jail if convicted of the misdemeanor weapons-related charge, according to the city attorneys office. Spindler, who could not be immediately reached for comment, is scheduled to be arraigned April 21 at Van Nuys courthouse. Spindler, who is a regular speaker during public comment periods at City Council and Police Commission meetings, was arrested last May after submitting the comment card during a committee meeting chaired by Council President Herb Wesson. Wesson, who is African American, said he took the card as a threat and sought and received a civil restraining order against Spindler, which required the attorney to surrender all firearms in his possession to the Los Angeles Police Department. The four weapons surrendered included three legally registered handguns, along with an AK 47 Class I Assault Rifle, a weapon illegal for unregistered possession in the state of California since 1991, according to the City Attorneys Office. The Los Angeles County District Attorneys Office in December opted not to charge Spindler over the comment card, saying it could not prove the card was a threat. In January, Spindler filed a federal lawsuit against the city, claiming his civil rights had been violated. City News Service; Photo: brian.ch via flickr.com",1,0,5
290,"By BRENDAN KRISEL (Patch Staff) A gunman, who opened fire Thursday at a rural Oregon community college killing at least 10 people, was from the South Bay, and his father still lives in Tarzana. Police identified the shooter as Chris Harper Mercer, a 26-year-old Oregon resident. According to The Los Angeles Times, he formerly lived in Torrance with his mother. His father is a resident of Tarzana, according to the newspaper. A nearby hospital activated disaster level response procedures after reports that up to 20 others were wounded. The shooting took place at Umpqua Community College in the southwest part of the state. News reports conflicted on the number of dead. Kourtney Moore, 18, was in the classroom that the shooter targeted. She told the News-Review Today, that she saw her teacher get shot in the head. Then the gunman entered the classroom and ordered everyone onto the ground. Later, the shooter asked people to stand up and state their religion before he started firing. Brady Winder, 23, was in the room next door when the shooting started. They left like ants, people screaming, Get out! Winder told the News-Review Today. CNN quoted the father of shooting victim Anastasia Boylan, who spoke to her father before going into surgery for a gunshot wound to the back. She described the gunman asking Christians to stand up before shooting them. And they would stand up and he said, Good, because youre a Christian, youre going to see God in just about one second, Boylans father, Stacy, told CNN, relaying her account. And then he shot and killed them. He engaged in a shootout with law enforcement and was killed, said Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin during a press conference. Hanlin said that the shooting was a huge shock, to the small community of Roseburg, Oregon. My heart is heavy as details of todays shooting become available, Gov. Kate Brown said earlier in a statement. While it is still too early to know all of the facts, the effects of an incident such as this one are long-lasting. Please join me in keeping the victims and their families, as well as first responders, in your thoughts. President Barack Obama, in an impassioned speech Thursday night, made arguably his most pointed remarks yet about the need for stricter gun laws.

291,"A Los Angeles Police Department Board of Rights recommended the firing of a detective who once fatally shot a fellow officer during a traffic dispute and more recently was accused of making racially charged comments at a training class about shooting black men, it was reported today. The LA Weekly, citing an anonymous department source, reported on its website that the board has recommended the termination of Detective Frank Lyga. The recommendation now moves to LAPD Chief Charlie Beck, who will decide whether to fire Lyga. Lyga was assigned to home duty with pay in June. LAPD internal affairs investigators opened an inquiry into the 57-year- old Lyga after a fellow officer filed a complaint against him for the comments he allegedly made while teaching a class at the departments training academy, Cmdr. Andy Smith said this summer. The investigation has centered on an audio recording allegedly capturing Lygas comments to a training class. A copy of the recording was released publicly by Jasmyne Cannick, a political consultant and writer. Cannick said the recording was made by a black officer who attended the class Lyga taught last November. On the recording, a man gives a rambling, expletive-laden talk that revolves mostly around Lygas 1997 fatal shooting of Kevin Gaines, an off-duty LAPD officer. According to police accounts of the shooting, Lyga was working an undercover narcotics operation when he became involved in a traffic dispute with Gaines on Ventura Boulevard near Lankershim. Apparently, neither man knew the other was a police officer. The shooting sparked racial tensions within the department because Gaines was black and Lyga is white. In recounting the LAPDs investigation into the shooting and the lawsuit Gaines family filed, the man on the recording complains he was unfairly labeled as a racist killer. He also recalled a confrontation he had with attorney Carl Douglas, who helped represent Gaines family in their lawsuit. Douglas, the man said, asked him if he believed all young black men were gang members and if he regretted shooting Gaines, the Los Angeles Times reported. I said, No. I regret he was alone in the truck at the time, the man said he replied. I could have killed a whole truckload of them and I would have been happy doing so. NBC4 reported that in a brief interview with Lyga, the detective acknowledged making the comments and expressed regret but claimed his words had been taken out of context. PHOTO Patch file photo.

Why are we the target? We dont understand, said Darshan Mundy, a public relations officer for the West Sacramento temple. The whole community is confused. Representatives from Christian, Catholic, Mormon, Muslim and Jewish faiths spoke to the crowd, offering condolences and pledging support for the Sikh community. It is a religion that promotes peace and promotes love, said Jon Fish, president of the Interfaith Council of Greater Sacramento.

297,"Laws to protect Californians from DUI offenders, help establish an earthquake early warning system, reform the California Public Utilities Commission, increase oversight of building contractors, require police to securely stow any handgun left in a car, improve tour bus safety, crack down on water-guzzling households, and more take effect on January 1. The new laws are the result of 17 bills that were introduced by Senator Jerry Hill, passed by the Legislature and signed by Governor Jerry Brown in 2016. Here are summaries of the bills that led to the new laws and what they do: Senate Bill 24 – JPA Pension Fix for San Mateo County Resolves a pension problem that prevented the cities of San Mateo, Belmont and Foster City from completing their Joint Powers Agreement for shared fire service. It allows the three cities to provide the JPA employees a defined benefit plan that those employees received as classic CalPERS members from their previous employment with the cities. San Mateo County Firefighters and the California Professional Firefighters supported SB 24, along with the cities of San Mateo, Belmont and Foster City. SB 62 – California Public Utilities Commission Office of the Safety Advocate Establishes the Office of the Safety Advocate within the California Public Utilities Commission to advocate for continuous, cost-effective improvement of safety management and safety performance of public utilities. SB 438 – Earthquake Early Warning Implementation Complements the $10 million included in the 2016-2017 budget for the statewide earthquake early warning system by establishing the Earthquake Early Warning Advisory Board within the Governors Office of Emergency Services. The new law brings California closer to statewide implementation of the earthquake early warning system. In emergencies, the alerts sent by the warning system will help prevent devastating and life-threatening missteps. Governor Browns announcement of his signing the bill is here and view video of the press conference held at the Office of Emergency Services headquarters here. SB 465 – Building Construction Contractors: Discipline, Reporting and Building Standards SB 465 is aimed at increasing oversight of contractors by closing the gaps in information that were revealed by the collapse of a balcony at a Berkeley apartment building on June 16, 2015. Ashley Donohoe, 22, of Rohnert Park, her cousin, Olivia Burke, 21, of Ireland, and four of their friends were killed. Seven other students from Ireland, including Aoife Beary who had been celebrating her 21st birthday, were hospitalized for weeks after the balcony gave way and sent them plummeting five stories to the ground. Aoife Beary, her mother Angela, Ashley Donohoes mother, Jackie, and representatives of the Irish Consulate testified to policy committees in the Capitol about the devastating loss felt by families from California to Ireland – and urged legislators to support SB 465, which was co-authored by Senator Loni Hancock, D-Oakland. The new law: SB 512 – Governance, Accountability and Transparency at the California Public Utilities Commission SB 512 reforms the governance structure of the California Public Utilities Commission by more clearly outlining the roles and responsibilities of commissioners and staff, and by requiring the CPUC to reach out to communities affected by CPUC decisions, instead of only to regulated utilities. To do so, SB 512 makes the following statutory changes: It 1) requires the commission to annually approve performance criteria for the commission and the executive director, and to annually evaluate the performance of the executive director based on those criteria; 2) requires the CPUC to reach out to those affected by its proceedings; 3) requires CPUC judges to adhere to ethics provisions of the Administrative Procedures Act; 4) allows the public to receive hearing transcripts at no charge; 5) permits the CPUC to meet in locations other than San Francisco; 6) requires the CPUC to modify its annual report to clarify how long the CPUC takes to finish rate or penalty cases; and 7) allows local governments to receive intervenor compensation when participating in CPUC efforts to improve safety, enabling local governments that have suffered catastrophes to seek such compensation. SB 661 – The Dig Safe Act of 2016 SB 661 addresses safety problems involving excavations and gas pipelines that are beneath soil or are otherwise underground by making clarifications to the so-called one-call law (Call 811 before you dig) and by creating the Safe Excavation Board, an appointed board of excavation stakeholders that is funded by fees on utilities. The board is to 1) investigate accidents and other one-call violations; 2) develop standards for safe excavation; and 3) coordinate education and outreach efforts. SB 812 – Improving Tour Bus Safety Improves the safety and oversight of tour buses operating in California by strengthening the California Highway Patrols tour bus inspection program. The law was prompted by a tour bus accident in San Franciscos Union Square in November 2015 that injured 20 people, at least five critically. After the crash, the CHP determined that the bus had never been inspected and was not registered with the California Public Utilities Commission, as is required by law. The CHP later conducted a surprise inspection of the companys bus fleet and found over 60 violations, 29 for mechanical problems. SB 814 – Cracking Down on Water-Guzzling Households During a Drought A winner of Senator Hills 2016 Oughta Be a Law…Or Not bill idea contest for constituents, SB 814 pulls the plug on excessive water use by households that flout mandatory reductions during drought emergencies. The law requires urban retail water suppliers to set rules for identifying and cracking down on households that consume enormous amounts of water despite restrictions imposed during a statewide declaration of a drought. The new law ensures that every urban retail water supplier has a tool to curb excessive water use by customers. Households that guzzle water – while neighbors and most other Californians abide by mandatory reductions – will no longer be able to hide and persist in their excess. SB 869 – Safe Storage of Police Handguns in Vehicles Another winner of Senator Hills 2016 Oughta Be a Law… contest, SB 869 responds to numerous thefts of handguns that law enforcement officers had left in cars. The stolen firearms included guns used in two murders in the Bay Area. SB 869 closes a legal loophole that had exempted law enforcement officers as well as concealed weapons permit holders from requirements to securely stow handguns in a lockbox out of plain view, or in the trunk, if the weapons are left in an unattended vehicle. SB 996 – Affordable Housing Property Tax Cap Aids local nonprofit and religious organizations that provide affordable housing by increasing the assessed property value exemption from $2,000,000 annually to $10,000,000 annually. The new law applies to three local nonprofits, such as the Saint Francis Center in Redwood City and the Ministry Services of the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul based in Los Altos Hills, which provides housing, food and clothing services to low-income families. SB 996 provides property tax relief to such organizations so that they can continue to provide more affordable housing for low income people and families. SB 1004 – Young Adult Offender Pilot Program Hailed by Governor Brown for its innovation, SB 1004 authorizes a pilot program in five counties, including Santa Clara, to give nonviolent young adult offenders between the ages of 18 and 21 the opportunity to take advantage of supportive and educational services in the juvenile justice system, rather than serve their time in an adult county jail. Although legally considered adults, these young offenders are still undergoing significant brain development, and may be better served by the juvenile justice system with age-appropriate, intensive services. Research shows that people do not develop adult-caliber, decision-making skills until their early 20s. Psychologists note that this maturity gap makes young adults more likely to engage in risk-seeking behavior. SB 1028 – Utility Wildfire Mitigation Plans SB 1028 requires 1) utilities regulated by the California Public Utilities Commission to file wildfire mitigation plans, 2) the CPUC to review those plans, and 3) publicly-owned utilities to also file wildfire mitigation plans with their governing boards. SB 1039 – Business and Professions Omnibus Bill SB 1039 makes several changes to the statutes governing various boards and bureaus under the Department of Consumer Affairs; includes specified fee increases for several boards including the Dental Hygiene Committee of California, the California Board of Optometry, the Board of Registered Nursing, the Board of Pharmacy, and the Contractors State License Board; and eliminates the Telephone Medical Advice Services Bureau. SB 1039 specifies that the continuing education standards established for nurses by the Board of Registered Nursing shall recognize specialized areas of practice, as previously required, and require that content be relevant to the practice of nursing, be related to the scientific knowledge or technical skills required for the practice of nursing, or be related to direct or indirect patient or client care. The legislation requires the nursing board to audit continuing education providers at least once every five years to ensure adherence to regulatory requirements. The new law also requires the board to withhold or rescind approval from any provider that is in violation of the regulatory requirements. SB 1046 – Ignition Interlock Devices for Drunk Driving Offenders Extends a pilot program requiring drunk driving offenders in Alameda, Los Angeles, Sacramento and Tulare counties to install the devices known as IIDs. IIDs are calibrated to the driver and prevent a car from starting if the driver is not sober. The four-county pilot would run until January 1, 2019, when the program would be expanded statewide with minor modifications so that: SB 1046 also creates an early incentive program, providing DUI offenders with full driving privileges soon after arrest if they install an IID. Their ultimate IID time requirement would be reduced based on when the early installation occurred. Low income offenders would be eligible for assistance to pay for an IID based on a sliding scale pegged to household income. SB 1192 – Private Post-Secondary Education SB 1192 changes the California Private Post-Secondary Education Act of 2009 to improve the effectiveness of the Bureau for Private Post-Secondary Education and opportunities for student success, and extends the BPPEs operations for four years. SB 1193 – Healing Arts, Board of Pharmacy, Veterinary Medical Board Sunset Bill SB 1193 makes changes to the Pharmacy Law, Veterinary Practice Act and Psychology Licensing Law to strengthen the laws and improve oversight of licensees by these boards. SB 1196 – Professions and Vocations: Bureau of Real Estate, Bureau of Real Estate Appraisers, and Bureau of Security and Investigative Services Bill SB 1196 ensures that the Bureau of Security and Investigative Services is subject to review by the appropriate policy committees of the Legislature. The legislation changes provisions in the Alarm Company Act, the Locksmith Act, the Private Investigator Act, the Private Security Services Act, Proprietary Security Services Act, and Collateral Recovery Act to improve the oversight, enforcement and regulation of licensees by the bureau. The bill also adds a sunset review date for the Bureau of Real Estate and the Bureau of Real Estate Appraisers, and changes existing laws to improve oversight, enforcement and regulation by the CalBRE and BREA. SB 1196 includes several consumer protection and public safety reforms to operations and oversight by the Bureau of Security and Investigative Services, which licenses about 380,000 companies and employees that provide alarm services, locksmith services, private investigation, private security, repossession services and firearm and baton training. The changes are intended to ensure that an applicant for licensure as an armed security guard is capable of exercising appropriate judgment, restraint and self-control; that armed security guards are qualified for their jobs, and that California regulators step up their policing of the industry. SB 1196 also imposes stricter training standards and requirements to ensure that shootings and incidents of suspected excessive force are investigated. In addition, the new law enables gun permits to be revoked when warranted and improves oversight of companies. – SUBMITTED FOR PUBLICATION BY: Office of State Senator Jerry Hill / Image via Shutterstock",0,8,5

299,"A Santa Ana man molested four girls aged 8 to 12 that he met through his Jehovahs Witness congregation, a prosecutor alleged Thursday, but the defendants attorney told jurors that her client was a victim of false accusations. Jose Luis Aguilera, 42, is charged with nine counts of lewd or lascivious acts with a minor younger than 14 and one count of kidnapping for child molesting, all felonies. Some of the allegations date back to January 2012, continuing through July 2015 when he was initially confronted by police. Aguilera was first confronted about allegedly molesting the girls after he took one of the victims to his apartment in Santa Ana on July 22, 2015, Senior Deputy District Attorney Heather Brown said. The defendant told the girls mother that he planned to take her daughter and his 6-year-old daughter to a Chuck E. Cheese restaurant, Brown said. When he arrived to pick up the alleged victim, his daughter was not with him, Brown said. Aguilera told the girl he needed to stop by his apartment to change his shirt and then he would pick up his daughter at school so they could all go to the restaurant, Brown said. When they got there, Aguilera changed his shirt and then pulled down the pants of the girl, who was so distraught that she ran out of the room crying and washed her face in the bathroom, Brown said. Aguilera took the girl with him to pick up his daughter and sign her out of school, and then they went to another restaurant, Brown said. The alleged victim was so upset that she didnt eat, so the defendant got his money back and took the girls to Chuck E. Cheese, where the alleged victim threw up, Brown said. Aguilera told his daughter that the girl had an upset stomach because she ate a bag of peanuts, the prosecutor said. When the girl got home, she was inconsolable and wouldnt talk to her older sister, but told her parents what happened when they got home, Brown said. The girls parents called police the next day and they set up a covert call between the defendant and the alleged victim, Brown said. The prosecutor told jurors to listen carefully to the defendants responses in the call as Aguileras wife comes and goes from the room during the conversation. Other parents started talking after hearing the rumors about the congregations elders and a police investigation, Brown said. One of the moms remembered a year earlier babysitting the defendants daughter, who said she saw her father kissing another girl, Brown said. A discussion about that alleged incident led the parents to two other girls who claimed to have been molested, Brown said. Under questioning from police, Aguilera initially denied touching any of the girls, but later gave confusing and inconsistent replies that included claims that he couldnt remember whether he molested the girls or not. Aguileras attorney, Sara Ross of the Orange County Public Defenders Office, said, This is a case of false stories, false memories and false accusations. Ross noted that two of the alleged victims are cousins and three of the four were in the same congregation. Two of the girls go to the same school, she said. The defense attorney said the congregation conducted its own investigation of the allegations and kicked her client out. All of the talking among the congregants prompted the girls to make false allegations, and social workers also asked the girls questions in a way that put details into their stories that werent there before, Ross alleged. Ross said she plans to have experts testify on the Jehovahs Witness religion and the psychiatry of false memories and suggestive questioning. One girl changed her story four times over multiple interviews, she said. One girl initially denied she was molested, Ross said, adding the girl told police, Hes nice to me. He gave me a teddy bear. Brown alleged the defendant plied the girls with money and gifts and took them to eat at Burger King to keep them from saying anything about the molestation. Santa Ana Police Department Photo",1,2,0
300,"Federal prosecutors will ask a judge on Wednesday to sentence an Orange County man to 30 years in federal prison for attempting to aid an Islamic terrorist group Muhanad Elfatih M.A. Badawi was convicted June 21, say that the ISIL travel case along with co-defendant Nader Salem Elhuzayel, who was sentenced Sept. 26 to 30 years behind bars. Prosecutors in the case say that Badawi deserves the same punishment of his co-defendant, though Badawi claims all that he did was loan Elhuzayel money to return to Israel to get married. Badawi was a radicalizer, recruiter, and facilitator, and like co- defendant Elhuzayel, defendant Badawi aspired to die a martyr fighting jihad for ISIL, prosecutors argue in their pre-sentencing brief, using one of the acronyms for the group also known as ISIS. Despite the attempts of others to dissuade him, defendant Badawi continued to promote the ISIL ideology and gather fighters for ISIL. In short, defendant Badawis role as a radicalizer, recruiter, and facilitator makes him more dangerous than any single would-be fighter. Badawis attorney, Kate Corrigan, conceded that her client engaged in a great deal of un-American and at times repulsive speech, but said Badawi was a lot of talk and absolutely no action. She claimed her client was duped by a dishonest Elhuzayel about what he intended to do with money Badawi loaned him. Elhuzayel was the first defendant convicted at trial to be sentenced in a so-called ISIL travel case, U.S. District Judge David O. Carter noted as he handed down the punishment last month. Elhuzayel was also convicted of 26 counts of bank fraud. Carter went through a lengthy detailing of Elhuzayels social-media declarations in support of the Islamic State before obtaining a ticket to Istanbul. The judge noted that the most important ingredient for the militant group was young warriors for the cause, adding that what strikes this court was the defendants willingness to die for his cause. Elhuzayels constant references to martyrdom makes you extremely dangerous, Carter told the defendant. The judge also noted that when Elhuzayel was arrested, he was carrying personal information about Defense Department employees. Those documents were leaked to the government so everyone had access to them, Elhuzayel said, interrupting the judge. There is no remorse, no repudiation of ISIL, only the message of death and destruction, Carter responded.The judge ordered the defendant to pay $3,376.14 in restitution and ordered lifetime supervised release, telling Elhuzayel that his greatest concern is youll be 55 and youll still have vigor when released from prison. Earlier in the hearing, the defendant interrupted Assistant U.S. Attorney Judith Heinz as she was detailing much of the same evidence Carter recounted, including Elhuzauels previous conviction for resisting arrest as he was being evicted from his familys home, which fell into foreclosure. I would like to note all I did was resist, Elhuzauel said. I am a good guy. I am not bad. I am not evil. I am a good guy. I say that with my heart. Love you, mom and dad. In his statement to the judge before sentencing, the Israeli citizen stuck with his story that he had been headed to Israel to marry a woman he had met online. Defense attorney Pal Lengyel-Leahu asked Carter for mercy, saying his client turned to religion when he faced ostracism from American and Israeli youths as he lived in both countries with dual citizenship. He looked different, he acted different, he was from over there, Lengyel-Leahu said. The attorney argued that decades behind bars would be inhumane, saying his client did not pose any danger to anyone because all he had was a plan to make a plan. During the trial, prosecutors characterized Elhuzayel and co-defendant Badawi as obsessively praising Islamic militants in Iraq and Syria on social media as they shared photos of beheadings of unbelievers. Elhuzayels attorney argued that his client should be acquitted on the legal technicality that the United States did not recognize the Islamic State as a terrorist organization at the time of the defendants arrest. Elhuzayel used the ISIS flag as his profile picture on a Facebook account, according to prosecutors, who said Badawi in October 2014 made a video of Elhuzayel swearing allegiance to the leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and pledging to travel to Syria to be an ISIS fighter. In March 2015, Badawi received a $2,865 Pell grant, which prosecutors said he used two months later to purchase a one-way airline ticket for Elhuzayel from Los Angeles International Airport to Tel Aviv, Israel, with a six-hour layover in Istanbul. Elhuzayel, who operated a scheme to rip off banks by depositing stolen checks into his personal accounts and then withdrawing cash from automated teller machines, was arrested at the airport.

301,"ORANGE COUNTY, CA—A onetime South Bay resident faces up to seven decades in federal prison at his sentencing today for traveling repeatedly to Cambodia to sexually assault impoverished children, four of whom testified to grueling sexual attacks that had jurors holding back tears. Ronald John Boyajian -- who was previously convicted over 20 years ago on nearly two dozen counts of statutory rape in Orange County -- was found guilty in March of federal counts of international travel with intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct with minors, engaging in illicit sexual conduct with a minor in foreign places, and commission of a felony offense involving a minor while required to register as a sex offender. Boyajian, acting as his own attorney, kept the case at a stalemate for seven years prior to the start of the six-week trial in Los Angeles. The case docket has more than 1,500 entries, most of them motions filed almost daily by Boyajian in which he objects to each aspect of the proceedings and has accused the judge of conspiring against him behind the scenes. His latest attempt to delay sentencing was denied late last week by U.S. District Judge Christina Snyder. Three women in their 20s who were children when they were sexually assaulted by the defendant, gave brief victim impact statements last week, telling the judge that the attacks had lasting, painful impacts on their lives. Speaking through a translator, one of the women urged the judge not to allow this man to leave prison because possibly there are other children out there that it could happen to -- just like it happened to me. Crying, she said, I dont want this to happen to other children. I want other children to have a happy life. Another woman told the court that since she was attacked by Boyajian more than seven years ago, she fears men and often finds herself grouchy for no reason. Boyajian, 55, who once lived in the Palos Verdes area, faces up to 70 years in federal prison for the two travel offenses and for committing the offenses while being required by California law to register as a sex offender. A federal jury deliberated for about five hours before returning guilty verdicts on all counts contained in a federal indictment handed down in September 2009. This case is about a man who wanted to sexually assault children -- and he found a place where he could do that, Assistant U.S. Attorney Vanessa Baehr-Jones told the jury at the start of the trial. Boyajian was arrested by the Cambodian National Police in February 2009 while on his 35th trip to Asia over a nine-year period. Boyajian began traveling to Cambodia -- one of Southeast Asias poorest countries -- shortly after completing his parole following convictions in Orange County for illegal sex with a minor and oral sex with a minor in 1994. Federal prosecutors presented evidence the defendant sexually assaulted girls who were between 8 and 11. One victim, who was 8 when she was molested, testified that he was cruel -- he treated me like I wasnt even human. Boyajian paid pimps and sometimes the victims relatives to have access to the children. The attacks took place in the village of Svay Pak -- known as Kilo 11 because it is located 11 kilometers outside of Cambodias capital city of Phnom Penh -- where the victims were Vietnamese immigrants who lived in the poor community. A Cambodian police anti-human trafficking officer testified at trial that Svay Pak was notorious as a place where foreigners went to have sexual contact with young girls. Boyajian went to Svay Pak to have unlimited access, prosecutors said in court. One of the females he assaulted -- now an adult working in Cambodia to help fellow victims of predators -- told jurors that Boyajian paid her grandmother to leave her alone with him in a wooden shack. She described being raped, beaten and bitten on the legs and calves by the defendant during multiple attacks. Boyajian was among the first defendants charged under an international law enforcement initiative specifically targeting Americans traveling to Cambodia for the purpose of sexually abusing children. Operation Twisted Traveler was an effort by the Justice Department and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to crack down on sex tourism. Boyajian has been in custody in Los Angeles since his removal from Cambodia seven years ago. In the years since he was charged, Boyajian lodged a raft of motions and continuances, ensuring the case remained deadlocked. In the minutes before the jury was called into the courtroom for opening statements on Feb. 3, Boyajian made a motion to have Snyder removed from the case. Following the verdicts, the defendant immediately filed motions objecting to the jurys racial mix, among other complaints. The investigation of Boyajian was begun by the Cambodian non- governmental organization Action Pour Les Enfants -- APLE -- whose investigators said they witnessed Boyajian visiting a child brothel in Svay Pak. It was here -- halfway across the world -- that foreigners like the defendant could freely target children who were being sold into prostitution, Baehr-Jones told the jury. Boyajian was charged under the Protect Act, which became law in 2003 and made it easier for U.S. authorities to prosecute people for overseas sex crimes. Federal authorities have made more than 70 arrests under the act in countries including Cambodia, Thailand and the Philippines. City News Service, Image Shutterstock",1,1,0

304,"The NYPD plans to go easier on New Yorkers caught smoking marijuana in public, but lighting up will still get certain people cuffed, city officials said Tuesday. Police will give criminal summonses instead of making arrests for most cases of public-pot smoking by Sept. 1. The new policy, developed over the last month by an NYPD working group, is expected to reduce marijuana arrests by more than half, Mayor Bill de Blasios office said. We are convinced, after four years of sustained progress, that we can do this in a way that will continue to enhance public safety, de Blasio, a Democrat, said at a news conference. But cops wont be so lenient in several circumstances. Any public pot smokers who lack identification or are on probation or parole will still face arrest, the city said, as will anyone with an existing criminal warrant or a documented history of violence. Cops will also arrest people whose smoking poses a public safety risk, such as if theyre toking and driving. The NYPD is not in the business of making criminals out of people with no prior arrest history, Police Commissioner James ONeill said. The new policy, which de Blasio first announced last month, will likely result in 10,000 fewer marijuana arrests, city officials said. There were about 19,000 such arrests last year, less than 17,000 of which were for public smoking. Police have generally arrested people for public smoking under the NYPDs current policy, which has faced criticism for its disparate racial impact. Black and Hispanic people accounted for 86 percent of marijuana arrests last year despite research showing all races use the drug at similar rates. De Blasio argued driving down marijuana arrests would inherently address the disparity in how the laws are enforced. Some 40 percent of people currently arrested for smoking pot had not been cuffed before, city officials said. Every time theres one fewer arrest, inherently it means someones life is not affected as negatively, and we know overwhelmingly those arrests are people of color, particularly young men of color, de Blasio said. But data suggests thats not necessarily true. Marijuana arrests fell 64 percent from 2010 to 2017, but black and Hispanic people have accounted for at least 84 percent of those arrests since 2011, according to figures published by Politico New York. Skeptical advocates said the citys new pot policy would do little to fix the racial disparity or even make it worse. City Councilman Rory Lancman, the chairman of the Committee on the Justice System, said cops shouldnt arrest anyone for smoking marijuana at all. Marijuana enforcement has long been a key pillar of broken windows policing, Donna Lieberman, the executive director of the New York City Liberties Union, said in a statement. Substituting summonses for arrests is certainly an improvement, but not nearly enough to end counterproductive and discriminatory policing that has disproportionate and harmful impacts on communities of color. The shift was announced a day after the state health commissioner said a report commissioned by Gov. Andrew Cuomo would recommend legalizing marijuana statewide. The Manhattan and Brooklyn district attorneys have previously pledged to limit prosecutions in marijuana cases. De Blasio does not fully support marijuana legalization, but hes created a task force to prepare the city for it. (Lead image: Photo from Shutterstock)",0,8,5
305,"Mayor Bill de Blasio will tell the NYPD to stop making arrests for public marijuana smoking as officials work to trim racial disparities in how drug laws are enforced. The mayor plans to direct the Police Department to give out summonses to people caught lighting up in public instead of cuffing them. The move, first reported by the New York Daily News, comes as the NYPD takes up a 30-day review of how it enforces marijuana laws in the city and state officials consider legalizing the drug altogether. The NYPD will come up with a plan to implement the policy shift, which is not imminent, a City Hall spokesman said. While he still has qualms about full legalization, de Blasio now thinks its inevitable and will create a task force to prepare the city for it. The group will consider zoning for dispensaries, approaches to public smoking and public health efforts around marijuana, according to the Daily News. With marijuana legalization likely to occur in our state in the near future, it is critical our city plans for the public safety, health, and financial consequences involved, the Democratic mayor said in a statement. While I still have real concerns we must work through, it isnt difficult to see where this is headed and any responsible policymaker must prepare for that eventuality. My focus now will be helping to craft the critical regulatory framework that must come before legalization is realized. The NYPD has issued summonses for possession of small amounts of marijuana since 2014 but continued to make arrests for smoking it in public. City Council Speaker Corey Johnson and the Rev. Al Sharpton pitched replacing arrests for public smoking with summonses as a way to lighten the burden of drug laws on black and Hispanic communities. Those two ethnic groups accounted for 86 percent of the citys marijuana arrests last year. The change to NYPD policy comes as Gov. Andrew Cuomo prepares to release the results of a study on marijuana legalization in New York. The governor has not fully backed legalization but commissioned the study earlier this year to examine its potential impacts. The Brooklyn and Manhattan district attorneys also moved last week to reduce prosecutions for smoking marijuana in public. De Blasio has opposed making marijuana legal even as progressives around the country have come to support it. Nine states have legalized the drug for recreational use and Phil Murphy, New Jerseys new Democratic governor, is reportedly pushing for legalization in his state. Last week, the mayor said he worries about a big marijuana industry growing out of legalization and trying to hook as many young people as possible on marijuana for the profit of those companies. If we were really trying to put things in order, we would say we need to address those issues up front and not make the mistakes we made with tobacco, for example, de Blasio said on WNYCs The Brian Lehrer Show. Advocates and lawmakers praised the mayor for shifting from arrests to summonses for smoking marijuana in public. But some said the city still has to ensure racial disparities in enforcement dont continue and that prior arrests dont harm New Yorkers rights. With the City finally acknowledging that enforcing marijuana prohibition is futile, and pressure from advocates to address the legacy of racial disparities from enforcement, it is the Citys duty to systematically address the harms and collateral consequences of past marijuana arrests, Kassandra Frederique, the New York State director of the Drug Policy Alliance, and Alyssa Aguilera, the co-executive director of VOCAL-NY, said in a joint statement.

306,"The NYPD will review its approach to enforcing marijuana laws in New York City amid persistent criticism over wide racial disparities in arrests for pot-related crimes. A working group comprising police leadership will examine how the department treats people caught carrying small amounts of marijuana or smoking it in public, Police Commissioner James ONeill said Tuesday. The move comes amid a push to ease consequences, borne disproportionately by people of color, for possession of a drug thats legal in nine states. Some 86 percent of people arrested on marijuana charges last year were black or Latino even though all racial groups use the drug at similar rates, officials have said. The working group will consult advocates, academics, prosecutors, defense attorneys and Mayor Bill de Blasios Office of Criminal Justice to determine how to enforce marijuana laws equitably without sacrificing public safety, the NYPD said. (T)here are differences in arrest rates, and they have persisted going back many years, long before this current Administration, ONeill said in a statement. We need an honest assessment about why they exist, and balance it in the context of the public safety needs of all communities. Police are cuffing fewer people than they were four years ago when the most serious charge is marijuana-related, but the NYPD now wants to address public concerns in the fairest way possible, while also promoting public safety and quality of life for all New Yorkers, ONeill added. Since 2014, police have generally issued summonses to people caught with 25 grams of marijuana, with certain exceptions, but continued to arrest people caught smoking in public. Rev. Al Sharpton and City Council Speaker Corey Johnson led a chorus of advocates and lawmakers Tuesday in calling on the NYPD to stop making arrests for lighting up in public — which accounts for the vast majority of marijuana arrests — and give out summonses instead. Doing so, they argued, would blunt the impact of continuing racial disparities in low-level marijuana enforcement as state officials consider legalizing the drug altogether. The arrest itself has impact on ones trying to conduct their lives that a summons doesnt, Sharpton said. So its a step in the right direction, but its by no means the end goal. Police officials have said residents 911 and 311 complaints, as well as reports at local community meetings, are a major driver of marijuana enforcement. But several analyses, including the City Councils own, have found the explanation doesnt add up. Cops arrest more people for marijuana offenses in predominantly black and Latino neighborhoods than in mostly white areas where residents complain about the drug at similar rates. For example, the 76th Precinct covering Red Hook, Brooklyn saw 246 pot arrests and 88 complaints about the drug to 911 and 311. By contrast, the 100th Precinct in southern Queens, which is more predominantly white, saw 113 complaints but just 22 arrests. If you are black and smoke marijuana, you go to jail, and if you are white and smoke marijuana, you still go to Yale, said Councilman Donovan Richards, (D-Queens), who chairs the Committee on Public Safety. Current NYPD policy lets cops cuff people caught with marijuana who have warrants out for their arrest or who arent able to provide identification. Johnson said it may make sense for such arrests to continue, depending on the crime for which the person is wanted, even if police decide to give summonses for smoking in public. The NYPDs pledge to review its pot policies came within hours of Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr.s announcement that his office will not prosecute marijuana possession or smoking cases starting in August. Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez also said Tuesday that his office would stop prosecuting most cases of marijuana smoking. The Brooklyn DAs office says it stopped prosecuting low-level pot possesion cases in 2014. The dual mission of the Manhattan D.A.s Office is a safer New York and a more equal justice system, Vance said in a statement. The ongoing arrest and criminal prosecution of predominantly black and brown New Yorkers for smoking marijuana serves neither of these goals. (Lead image: Photo from Shutterstock)",0,8,5
307,"The NYPD settled a lawsuit Thursday over its post-9/11 surveillance of Muslims in New Jersey, pledging not to spy on religious groups without reason and agreeing to let the groups that sued give feedback on its policies. The settlement in New Jersey federal court came nearly six years after the plaintiffs filed the lawsuit challenging the NYPDs efforts to monitor and infiltrate Muslim groups there. We are proud that we stood up to the most powerful police force in the country and against the suspicion and ignorance that guided their discmininatory practices, Farhaj Hassan, a U.S. Army reservist and the lead plaintiff in the case, said in a statement. The Police Department agreed to pay $75,000 in damages to the plaintiffs — who included Muslim individuals, organizations and businesses — and cover $950,000 of their legal fees, but did not admit to any wrongdoing. The plaintiffs filed the suit in June 2012, arguing the NYPD illegally spied on at least 20 mosques, more than two dozen businesses, two schools and two Muslim student associations in what they called a discriminatory surveillance program that started in early 2002. A series of Associated Press reports in 2011 uncovered the program, which also targeted Muslims in New York City and on Long Island. The Police Department has reportedly settled two other lawsuits related to the surveillance program. One settlement reached in March 2017 made the NYPD pledge several reforms to how it conducts investigations. In the New Jersey settlement, the NYPD agreed not run investigations in which race, religion or ethnicity is a substantial or motivating factor. The Police Department agreed to seal certain reports the surveillance program generated and expunge, if possible, information its Intelligence Bureau collected about the plaintiffs. Much of that information was gathered by the Zone Assessment Unit, which was disbanded in 2014, the NYPD said. Under the settlement, the plaintiffs also get to give feedback on a new policy guide and training materials the NYPD is developing for the Intelligence Bureau. And the NYPD agreed to have top officials appear at a public meeting with the plaintiffs in New York City where New Jerseyans can air their concerns. The resolution of this case affirms and enhances the NYPDs commitment to conducting effective investigations to prevent crime and terrorism, Police Commissioner James ONeill said in a statement. This has occurred while also protecting the constitutional rights and freedoms that every NYPD employee takes a sworn oath to uphold. The plaintiffs traveled a long legal road to reach the settlement. A New Jersey federal judge dimsissed the lawsuit in February 2014, but an appellate court reversed that decision and sent the case back to the original court in October 2015.

308,"The NYPD has left its special sex crimes division understaffed for nearly a decade even amid a spike in cases and internal warnings, city investigators said in a report published Tuesday. The 67 detectives in the Special Victims Divisions adult sex crimes units handled more than 5,600 cases last year, a load over 20 times heavier than the NYPDs homicide squad, the Department of Investigation report said. The Police Department has kept Special Victims staffing essentially unchanged even though the sex crime caseload has increased 65.3 percent since 2009, the DoI found in a yearlong probe conducted by the departments NYPD inspector general and other staff. The divisions overwhelmed staffers work in dilapidated offices and give more attention to high-profile cases and stranger rapes, often leaving other cases in the hands of untrained precinct detectives, the DoI found. The report said the NYPD should double the size of its sex crime units to make sure every case and victim are treated properly. Victims of sexual assault deserve justice, with the full weight of law enforcement by their side, DoI Commissioner Mark Peters said in a statement. The neglect and understaffing of NYPDs Special Victims Division are serious and deeply troubling and the failure to treat acquaintance rape as an equal priority is unacceptable. Police brass have left the Special Victims Division — tasked with investigating sex crimes, child abuse and hate crimes — woefully shorthanded despite repeated warnings from its leadership and a 2010 report from the NYPDs own Sex Crimes Working Group that recommended hiring 26 extra investigators, the report says. The dearth of staff has led the division to prioritize stranger rapes and cases with high media profiles while giving short shrift to other sexual assaults, says the report, which calls the practice unacceptable in modern law enforcement. Thats despite the fact that domestic and acquaintance rapes — cases in which the victim knows the perpetrator — account for nearly 90 percent of the citys reported rapes every year, the report said. In some of those cases, precinct detectives continue the investigation after an arrest is made, meaning cops without special sex crimes training handle cases that are notoriously difficult to prosecute, the DoI found. Additionally, Special Victims Division staff work in cramped, unsanitary spaces where theyre forced to interview victims near other cops and even holding cells, the report says. Such run-down facilities make victims less likely to report sex crimes and more likely to disengage once an investigation has started, the report found. In January, Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce said the Special Victims Division added 26 investigators in 2017, boosting its ranks to 259 investigators with plans to add more this year. Each investigator has been trained in an empathy-based technique to get information from victims of trauma, he said. Thats the largest Special Victims Division in the country, Boyce said in January. So well keep going forward in that direction. But the DoI found that only four investigators were added to the adult sex crime staff last year, all of whom were assigned to Staten Island. The others went to different units within the Special Victims Division, such as the child abuse squads, the report says. The DoI recommended hiring 73 new detectives to the Special Victims Divisions sex crime squads to keep up with the heavy caseload. The NYPD should also have the division treat all rape cases the same, train sex crime detectives more thoroughly and renovate or move the spaces where the divisions sex crime units work, the report says. The report comes amid a nationwide movement to combat sexual harassment and assault that has led to the downfall of several powerful figures, such as disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein and U.S. Sen. Al Franken. The NYPD and Manhattan prosecutors are pursuing rape charges against Weinstein. The Police Department has created a team of investigators to handle high-profile sex crime cases, the New York Daily News reported in December. The New York City chapter of the National Organization for Women said the DoIs findings provide more evidence supporting womens rights advocates long-held concerns about how police handle sexual assault cases. This report confirms what we see first hand: sexual assault is not treated as a high priority at the top levels of the NYPD, and sex crime victims and public safety suffer the consequences, Jane Manning, the director of advocacy for Womens Justice NOW, a NOW sister organization, said in a statement. NYPD spokesman J. Peter Donald slammed the report as an investigation in name only that damages the relationships of trust the (Special Victims Division) has worked hard to develop with survivors of sex crimes. Investigators failed to interview key NYPD officials and misstated figures about the divisions staffing levels and caseload, Donald said in an emailed statement. He said the division has 85 detectives handling adult sex crime cases, not 67. Each investigator had 62 cases on average last year, he said, while the average precinct-level investigator had 150 to 175. The Special Victims Division uses a survivor-centered investigation model, which does not pressure victims to participate in criminal investigations after reporting sex crimes, Donald said. The division and other police brass also meet regularly with advocates, he said. Even the Inspector Generals own document recognizes that the NYPD has been and continues to be the leader in investigating sex crimes—a view held by many others—in New York City and around the world, Donald said.

309,"Blame it on the neighbors. Cops continued to arrest more black and Latino New Yorkers for marijuana possession last year because the most complaints about people smoking pot came from neighborhoods of color, a top NYPD official told the City Council Monday. African-American and Latino people accounted for 86 percent of the roughly 17,500 marijuana arrests recorded last year, Councilman Donovan Richards (D-Queens) said. Thats despite those groups accounting for just 53 percent of the citys population and statistics showing all ethnic groups use the drug at similar rates. Precincts in predominantly black and Latino areas such as East Harlem, Washington Heights, the South Bronx and Bedford Stuyvesant, Brooklyn recorded the highest numbers of arrests, Dermot Shea, the NYPDs chief of crime control strategies, said Monday at a joint hearing of two Council committees. Those neighborhoods also made the largest numbers of complaints about people smoking marijuana to 911 and 311 and at community meetings, Shea said, arguing that cops are tackling the crime where they hear its most prevalent. We are being responsive to complaints that are coming to us and it would be negligent for us to ignore those complaints, Shea said at a Council committee hearing on the citys enforcement of marijuana laws. Mayor Bill de Blasio and then-Police Commissioner Bill Bratton moved to decriminalize marijuana in 2014, ordering cops to give criminal summonses to anyone found with less than 25 grams of the drug instead of arresting the person. But the grace doesnt apply in certain circumstances like when someone is burning pot in public, which is the basis for about 90 percent of marijuana arrests, Shea said. Racial disparities in arrests have continued despite de Blasios stated desire to eliminate them and the Brooklyn and Manhattan district attorneys promises of leniency for low-level marijuana charges. NYPD officials said its difficult to calculate the exact number of complaints from people who smell the drug because theyre entered using different spellings of marijuana, or other names such as weed or pot. But there was a clear increase across the board in calls about pot to both 911 and 311 last year, said Oleg Chernyavsky, the NYPDs director of legislative affairs. City lawmakers were skeptical that neighbors complaints alone were driving arrests in predominantly black and Latino neighborhoods. Richards and Councilman Rory Lancman (D-Queens) said they wouldnt buy the claim without specific numbers on 911 and 311 calls. I refuse to believe that in New York City, a city of eight and a half million people, that the only individuals who are calling 911 or 311 around this issue are people in communities of color, Richards said. Shea said the NYPD has worked to reduce marijuana arrests since de Blasios 2014 decriminalization move. The number fell from about 26,000 that year to about 16,000 in 2015, Shea said, but its risen slightly since then. Lawmakers and advocates said police are maintaining racial disparities by targeting black and brown neighborhoods more aggressively than white neighborhoods. Shea denied that such practices exist. Its obvious that on a precinct-by-precinct basis commanders are making a decision about what to enforce more strictly and how to do that, Lancman said. Police and prosecutors should go further to resolve racial disparities, some advocates and public defenders argued — the NYPD should stop making arrests on low-level marijuana charges and district attorneys should not prosecute them at all. The debate comes as state lawmakers consider Gov. Andrew Cuomos proposal for a study of the statewide legalization of marijuana. The City Council is considering a bill that would require the NYPD to issue quarterly reports on marijuana arrests and summonses. Chernyavsky said the department will work with lawmakers on the bill in the name of transparency. Were probably the most transparent weve ever been as a department, as an administration and we look forward to working with you in furtherance of transparency going forward, Chernyavsky said.

310,"The Islamic State group on Thursday claimed responsibility for this weeks Tribeca attack that killed eight people and wounded a dozen. The latest issue of ISIS Al-Naba newsletter calls alleged attacker Sayfullo Saipov a soldier of the Caliphate, according to published translations. The newsletter, written in Arabic, does not indicate direct coordination between Saipov and ISIS but suggests the group inspired his attack, news reports say. One of the Islamic State soldiers in America attacked on Tuesday a number of crusaders on a street in New York City, the newsletter says, according to CNN. U.S. and New York law enforcement officials have said Saipov, 29, closely followed ISIS instructions for killing Western civilians with large vehicles. He considered hanging ISIS flags from the pickup truck he used to run down pedestrians and cyclists on the Hudson River Greenway, according to a court filing. ISIS took longer to claim responsibility for this attack than other terrorist-inspired strikes in the West. It took credit within a day of a similar truck attack in Berlin, Germany last December. It also took less than a day to claim the June 2016 massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. The group usually publishes claims of responsibility through its Amaq News Agency, and does not make them when the attacker is in custody, according to The New York Times. The FBI and NYPD are continuing to probe Saipovs path to the attack and his possible links to ISIS. The New Jersey resident, who is facing federal terrorism charges, left a note saying he carried out the strike in ISIS name, court filings show. Saipov came to the U.S. from Uzbekistan in 2010 and previously lived in Florida and Ohio. Investigators believe he was radicalized domestically, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday. Authorities found about 90 videos of violent ISIS propaganda on one of his cellphones, court filings say. The FBI is looking into a 2015 wedding in Florida that was attended by Saipov and another man who was the subject of a federal terrorism investigation, the Times reported. In Friday morning tweets reacting to ISIS claim, President Donald Trump said the terrorist group will pay a big price for every attack on us!

311,"NEW YORK CITY — Threatening flyers bearing a huge swastika and telling Jews to get out and blacks and gay people to burn in hell have been sent to addresses throughout New York City. The hate mail was received at seven locations in Manhattan and Brooklyn between Sept. 29 to Oct. 2 — including the official Israeli Mission to the United Nations on Second Avenue, the NYPD said. President Donald Trumps campaign slogan, Make America Great Again, is emblazoned on the flyers beneath a swastika that takes up about half the page. The leaflets also say JUDEN RAUS, German for Jews out, NEGROES AND F----TS MUST BURN IN HELL and CHRISTIAN IDENTITY IS BACK. Weiss Bakery, a kosher bakery in Borough Park, Brooklyn, was one of the targets. Employees came in Monday morning to find the flyer had been mailed over the weekend, bakery owner Abraham Weiss told Patch. It was disgusting, Weiss said in a phone interview. These days people go back to the Nazi era — its ridiculous that in this day and age something is happening. (For more on this and other neighborhood stories, subscribe to Patch to receive daily newsletters and breaking news alerts.) The NYPD said the Nazi mailers other targets include: Acting Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez said his office is investigating the letters. We are aware of this and similar letters that have been sent, Gonzalez tweeted Tuesday afternoon. We are investigating and will not stand for these acts. The threats come during the Jewish high holiday season. Sept. 29, the first day they were reported, marked the start of Yom Kippur. Wednesday is the first day of Sukkot, a weeklong celebration recalling the Israelites 40-year journey through the desert. Weiss said he called state Assemblyman Dov Hikind, who represents the area, after finding the flyer. The assemblyman came to talk with the bakerys staff before calling police, Weiss said. Hikind posted photos of the flyer to social media on Tuesday afternoon. This is the first time the bakery has been hit with anti-Semitic threats, said Weiss, who has owned it for about 20 years. The store has been open since the 1940s, he said. This threat against one of our communitys beloved establishments, which used the U.S. mail, is absolutely a hate crime, Hikind wrote in a Facebook post Tuesday. Its sad that we live in a time when such disgusting things are said about various races, including the Jews, but we will certainly take these matters seriously when they arise and act swiftly and responsibly, in tandem with the police, to make sure our community members are safe and protected. Hate crimes are on the rise this year, according to NYPD data. A total of 282 hate crimes, including 122 anti-Semitic crimes, have been reported citywide as of Oct. 1. Thats up from 234 total hate crimes and 85 anti-Semitic crimes reported in the same time last year. Anti-black hate crimes have doubled so far this year to 24 incidents from 12 last year, the NYPD said. Some 41 hate crimes based on sexual orientation have been reported this year, down from 61 last year. Weiss said his bakery has gotten new customers and a barrage of supportive phone calls and new customers from the whole world since word of the flyers spread. Someone even called from Iowa wanting to buy bread, he said. Im not scared, Weiss said. (This story has been updated. Lead image via Google Maps.)",1,0,3
312,"By Lauren Kirchner, ProPublica This story was co-published with The New York Times. Over the past decade, the DNA laboratory in the office of New York Citys chief medical examiner emerged as a pioneer in analyzing the most complicated evidence from crime scenes. It developed two techniques, which went beyond standard practice at the FBI and other public labs, for making identifications from DNA samples that were tiny or that contained a mix of more than one persons genetic material. As its reputation spread, the lab processed DNA evidence supplied not only by the New York police, but also by about 50 jurisdictions as far away as Bozeman, Montana, and Floresville, Texas, which paid the lab $1,100 per sample. Now these DNA analysis methods are under the microscope, with scientists questioning their validity, ProPublica has found. In court testimony, a former lab official said she was fired for criticizing one method, and a former member of the New York State Commission on Forensic Science said he had been wrong when he approved their use. The first expert witness allowed by a judge to examine the software source code behind one technique recently concluded that its accuracy should be seriously questioned. Earlier this year, the lab shelved the two methods and replaced them with newer, more broadly used technology. A coalition of defense lawyers is asking the New York State inspector generals office — the designated watchdog for the states crime labs — to launch an inquiry into the use of the disputed analysis methods in thousands of criminal cases. While the inspector general has no jurisdiction over the court system, any finding of flaws with the DNA analysis could prompt an avalanche of litigation. Previous convictions could be revisited if the flawed evidence can be shown to have made a difference in the outcome. The medical examiners office has engaged in negligent conduct that undermines the integrity of its forensic DNA testing and analysis, the Legal Aid Society and the Federal Defenders of New York wrote the inspector general on Friday. Because the lab has kept problems with its unreliable testing and unsound statistical evidence secret from the public and the courts, they continued, innocent people may be wrongly convicted, and people guilty of serious crimes may go free. In addition to those convicted using the disputed methods, many defendants may have chosen to plead guilty when they learned prosecutors had DNA evidence against them. Their cases face significant barriers to reconsideration. The medical examiners office stands by its science. Its chief of laboratories, Timothy Kupferschmid, said that the discarded techniques were well-tested and valid, and that the lab was adopting newer methods to align with changing FBI standards. He compared it to a vehicle upgrade. So just because were switching to the new model, I mean, our old pickup truck worked great, but my new pickup truck is so much better, he said. One case that hinges on the disputed DNA techniques stemmed from the beating of Taj Patterson in December 2013. A group of Hasidic men attacked Patterson, a black student, in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. Prosecutors blamed the attack on the Shomrim, a Hasidic group that patrols Williamsburg, a neighborhood where tensions between Orthodox Jews and blacks have long simmered. Six days after the attack, the police found one of Pattersons black Air Jordan sneakers on a nearby roof.The police sent the sneaker to the DNA lab, where a technician swabbed a 3-inch by 6-inch area of its heel — and recovered 97.9 picograms of DNA from at least two people. A picogram is one trillionth of a gram. The sample bore Pattersons DNA. Using software developed in-house, the lab calculated that it was 133 times more likely than not that the remainder belonged to Mayer Herskovic, a young father who lived and worked in Williamsburg and had no criminal record. I dont believe that this is DNA, Herskovic told ProPublica. A mixture, like you take milk, orange juice and water and you mix it, what is it? Is it still milk? Is it still orange juice? I dont know. DNA is the magic word, he added. If you throw it into a trial, they eat it up. For me, its not magic at all. Mayer Herskovics recent conviction for a violent assault in 2013 relied heavily on DNA evidence analyzed by the New York City medical examiners office, using methods that are now disputed. (Demetrius Freeman, special to ProPublica)No other physical evidence linked Herskovic to the attack on Patterson, who was blinded in his right eye. Neither the victim nor those who witnessed the crime identified Herskovic at trial, nor was he seen on surveillance video. Herskovic said he has never been part of the Shomrim, and deplored the assault on Patterson. Nevertheless, he was convicted by a judge of gang assault, and sentenced this past March to four years in prison. He is appealing. Three years ago, Barry Scheck, a co-founder of the Innocence Project, a nonprofit that uses DNA evidence to exonerate wrongly convicted prisoners, yelled at his colleagues on the state forensic commission about the potential perils of the DNA work at the citys lab. The day of reckoning is going to come, Scheck told his fellow commissioners, some of whom rolled their eyes, a video of the meeting showed. Someday people are going to review this, he continued. Its an Ebola. It is a cancer here that could be spreading. We are all on notice. For three decades, forensic DNA evidence has been a valuable tool in criminal investigations, incriminating or exonerating suspects. Matching a defendants genetic material with a sample found on a weapon or at a crime scene has proved extremely persuasive with judges and juries. But not all DNA evidence is equal. Sometimes its clear: blood or semen identifies a single person. If its just a few skin cells left on an object, or if it contains more than one persons genetic material, it can be more ambiguous. In such situations, labs used to report that the results were inconclusive, or the defendant could not be excluded from the mix. New types of DNA analysis have been introduced in recent years to interpret trace amounts or complex mixtures, spawning an industry of testing tools, chemical kits and software. As analysis has become more complex, the techniques and results are coming under fire nationwide. In the past three years, flaws in DNA methods have temporarily shut down testing in public crime labs in Austin, Texas, and Washington, D.C. Lab analysts make it seem like its a completely objective process, said Bicka Barlow, a lawyer in California with a masters degree in genetics and molecular biology. But Im 100 percent convinced that there are many people who are incarcerated who were convicted with DNA evidence who are innocent. The two techniques that New Yorks lab introduced were the high-sensitivity testing of trace DNA amounts, and the Forensic Statistical Tool, or FST, in which software calculates the likelihood that a suspects genetic material is present in a complicated mixture of several peoples DNA. By its own estimate, the lab has used high-sensitivity DNA testing to analyze evidence samples in 3,450 cases over the past 11 years, and FST in 1,350 cases over the past six. Cases in which both methods were used may be counted in both totals. Michael Hirshon, special to ProPublicaIn February 2012, responding to a 911 call about gunshots near East Tremont Avenue, police officers from the 45th Precinct in the Bronx saw a passer-by make a motion as if he was dropping an object under a parked car. His was a familiar face: Johnny Morgan, who had been arrested 75 times. The police found a .40-caliber Glock 23 beneath the car. Morgan was charged with gun possession, based both on DNA evidence and witness testimony. But the amount of DNA recovered from the gun was extremely small; the lab initially said it was unsuitable for testing. After the prosecutor and the police requested a high-sensitivity test, analysts said Morgans DNA was a match. He was convicted. Public crime labs assessing DNA evidence, including the FBIs lab, amplify, or copy, the material 28 times to conduct their analysis. Under the high-sensitivity testing method developed by Theresa Caragine, a forensic scientist, and implemented in 2006, New Yorks lab began to push very small amounts through three more cycles, bringing the total to 31. This approach provided more material to look at — as much as eight times the standard approach. But, like turning up the volume on a radio, those additional cycles amplified small imperfections from missing or contaminated DNA. To reduce potential problems, the lab decided not to amplify samples smaller than 20 picograms, or about three cells worth of DNA, its then-director, Mechthild Prinz, said in 2005 during the states approval process for the test. She declined to comment for this article. The scientific community has been asked to test more and more evidence with less and less amounts of DNA, Prinz explained in 2009 to the DNA Subcommittee of the state forensic science commission, which approves all forensic methods used in New York State. A couple of years ago, DNA testing was limited to body fluids — semen, blood and saliva. Now every laboratory in the country routinely receives swabs from guns, other weapons, burglary tools and cash registers, she said. After several years of high-sensitivity testing of small amounts of DNA, the lab developed a second method: a piece of software to interpret complex mixtures. Invented by Caragine and Adele Mitchell, a geneticist with a specialty in statistics who joined the lab in 2008, the Forensic Statistical Tool, or FST, considers the overall amount of DNA in the mixture, how many people are in it, how much information is probably missing or contaminated, and the frequency with which each piece of DNA appears in different racial or ethnic groups. Then it compares the defendants DNA profile to the mixture, and calculates a likelihood ratio, which it expresses as a single number. The bigger that number — and its sometimes in the millions or even trillions — the more likely that the defendants DNA is present. Caragine and Mitchell testified in 2012 that about a third of all test results were favorable to defendants, by indicating that their DNA was probably absent. Only a small proportion of cases using the Forensic Statistical Tool went to trial. Most defendants faced with unfavorable FST results pleaded guilty, defense lawyers say. Just the prospect of those numbers going in front of the jury could really warp the plea bargaining process, said Brad Maurer, a lawyer and DNA specialist at New York County Defender Services. Eric Rosenbaum, an assistant district attorney and head of the DNA Prosecutions Unit in Queens, described FST as an extremely powerful tool because it is devastating in court. Clinton Hughes, a lawyer at the Legal Aid Society, is part of a team that has challenged the admissibility of DNA results from two disputed techniques. (Demetrius Freeman for The New York Times)In December 2012, The New York Times profiled Mitchell and Caragine in the article One interested reader was Eli Shapiro, the former mitochondrial DNA technical leader in the DNA lab. One reason for his early retirement, he later testified, was the stress over having to sign off on lab reports generated by the software. Even in the lab, few people knew the science behind it. Shapiro later said in court that he found the FST process described in the article very disturbing. He reached out to his former boss and colleagues to express his alarm. They were not concerned, he testified.So, in early 2013, Shapiro offered his help to Legal Aid, which had just formed a unit specializing in DNA evidence. Under a judges order, the lab had given Legal Aid the results of its validation studies — internal tests of FSTs accuracy. Shapiro helped decipher the data. He knows the math, said Clinton Hughes, a Legal Aid lawyer. For relaxation, he does long division on the beach with a pencil. From 2012 to 2014, a hearing in Brooklyn before Judge Mark Dwyer focused on DNA evidence in two cases: it had been recovered from the handlebars of a bicycle after a shooting, and from the clothing of a sexual assault victim. With the help of testimony from Shapiro and some of the worlds most renowned DNA experts, Legal Aid hoped to persuade the judge to throw out the evidence. The defense experts were denied access to FSTs software code, which would later come under scrutiny. Instead, they criticized the way that Caragine and Mitchell designed and tested FST. Bruce Budowle, an architect of the FBIs national DNA database, testified that New Yorks statistical methods were not defensible. He said that FST was designed with the incorrect assumption that every DNA mixture of the same size was missing information or had been contaminated in just the same way. He also criticized the labs overreliance on pristine saliva and samples to test its methods, which do not mirror the ways real crime-scene evidence is degraded by time and weather. The lab underestimated the challenges, he testified. Five-person mixtures can look like three-person, he said, four contributors can look like two-person mixtures. Its almost impossible to actually be accurate. Police in Florida and other states are building up private DNA databases, in part by collecting voluntary samples from people not charged with — or even suspected of — any particular crime. The softwares inventors acknowledged a margin of error of 30 percent in their method of quantifying the amount of DNA in a sample, a key input into the FST calculation. They acknowledged that FST didnt consider that different people in a mixture, especially family members, might share DNA. In April 2013, weeks after testifying, Caragine was forced to resign from the lab after New Yorks inspector general found that she had violated protocol by changing her colleagues FST results in two cases. Her defense was that she was correcting their mistakes. Mitchell left in 2014. Caragine declined to comment for this article, and Mitchell did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Perhaps the most dramatic testimony in the hearing came from Ranajit Chakraborty, who had developed the FBIs policy on DNA in the 1990s and, as a member of New Yorks DNA Subcommittee, voted to approve both high-sensitivity testing in 2005 and FST in 2010. What he had since learned about FST bothered him. What would your vote be today? Jessica Goldthwaite, a lawyer for Legal Aid, asked Chakraborty on the stand. My answer would be no, he said. In November 2014, Judge Dwyer sided with the defense, excluding evidence produced by both high-sensitivity testing and FST. He was the first state judge to do so, and so far the only one. Appointed to the state forensic science commission when it formed in 1994, Scheck didnt vote for either of the labs methods. His misgivings grew when he learned that the DNA sample used to convict Morgan in the Bronx gun case was only 14.15 picograms. That was below the 20-picogram minimum for high-sensitivity testing the lab had promised to set during its approval process back in 2005. At the October 2014 commission meeting, Scheck pounded the table as he proposed to compel the lab to turn over any validation studies it had conducted for high-sensitivity testing of especially small samples. He accused lab officials of not having performed the necessary studies, despite their assurances otherwise. While Schecks motion failed, it drew a vote from an unexpected supporter: Marina Stajic, who then worked for the medical examiners office as the director of the toxicology lab. She supported the motion, she later testified, because she believed that the DNA lab should be transparent with its data. Her boss, Dr. Barbara Sampson, the chief medical examiner, heard about Stajics vote the next morning. She expressed her anger in an email to a colleague, Hold me down. Mimi Mairs, then a lawyer for the DNA lab, emailed, She sucks. A spokeswoman for the medical examiners office declined to comment on the correspondence, as did the Manhattan district attorneys office, where Mairs is now a prosecutor. In April 2015, Dr. Sampson and Kupferschmid fired Stajic, who had worked at the lab for 29 years. Kupferschmid then called a commission member to inquire whether Stajic would also be removed from the oversight group, according to court documents. In February 2016, Stajic sued Dr. Sampson, Kupferschmid and the city for allegedly violating her First Amendment rights. The defendants lawyer contends Stajic cant prove why she was fired, and that her vote wasnt constitutionally protected speech. Her case is pending. Michael Hirshon, special to ProPublicaThe case that finally revealed FSTs source code began with a few drops of cooking oil. Kevin Johnson and his ex-girlfriend Octaviea Martin shared custody of two sons, and he sometimes stayed over in her Bronx apartment. One night in April 2015, he was cooking cheeseburgers when some oil spilled. He and Martin argued about cleaning it up. Her daughter got upset and called 911, telling the dispatcher that Johnson was pointing a gun at Martin. A police search of the apartment turned up two socks wedged between the refrigerator and the wall. In one sock was a black pistol; in the other, a silver revolver. Johnson, who had been convicted on a previous weapons charge, was arrested. The lab found that one gun contained two peoples DNA; by FSTs calculation, it was 156 times more likely than not to contain Johnsons DNA. The second gun had three peoples DNA and a formidable likelihood of 66 million. Hoping to cast doubt on the DNA results, his lawyers, Christopher Flood and Sylvie Levine, asked for the FST source code, which other lawyers had sought in vain. Again, the government refused to hand it over on the grounds that it was a proprietary and copyrighted statistical tool owned by the City of New York. The federal judge granted the defense access to the FST code in June 2016 under an order that bars wider disclosure. (The medical examiners office denied ProPublicas public records request for the code, citing its sensitive nature.) Nathaniel Adams, a computer scientist and an engineer at a private forensics consulting firm in Ohio, reviewed the code for the defense. He found that the program dropped valuable data from its calculations, in ways that users wouldnt necessarily be aware of, but that could unpredictably affect the likelihood assigned to the defendants DNA being in the mixture. I did not leave with the impression that FST was developed by an experienced software development team, Adams wrote in an affidavit. Pending more rigorous testing, the correctness of the behavior of the FST software should be seriously questioned. Characterizing Adams criticisms as merely stylistic rather than substantive, the lab told ProPublica that FST provided reliable calculations. Technology consultants wrote the software code for FST, according to a spokeswoman at the medical examiners office. Few, if anyone, at the lab or on the states DNA Subcommittee had the expertise to double-check the software, said a scientist in the lab who worked on the techniques who asked to remain anonymous for fear of career repercussions. We dont know whats going on in that black box, and that is a legitimate question, the scientist said, adding that evidence in older cases should absolutely be retested in light of growing questions about FST. As a scientist, I cant say no. Powerful software is solving more crimes and raising new questions about due process. The U.S. attorneys office withdrew the DNA evidence against Johnson days before the hearing about its admissibility was scheduled to begin. Nevertheless, Johnson pleaded guilty this past May. On Aug. 28, he was sentenced to 28 months in prison, almost all of which he has already served. His lawyers declined to make him available for an interview.As Johnsons case proceeded, the lab circulated a memo to clients in September 2016, notifying them that it would replace both high-sensitivity testing and FST on Jan. 1. A new chemical kit would make the additional amplification cycles of the high-sensitivity method unnecessary. The lab would retire FST in favor of STRmix, a commercially available and FBI-endorsed software program for DNA mixtures that dozens of public labs use. The medical examiners office is fully committed to staying on the cutting edge of new technology to best serve the City of New York, Kupferschmid wrote in the memo. He added that the lab would raise the minimum sample size for testing to 37.5 picograms — almost twice the initial floor of 20 picograms.The change in policy is scant consolation to those who were convicted based on the discarded DNA techniques, like Mayer Herskovic. After the gang attack on Patterson, two confidential informants gave Herskovics name to a police detective. Herskovic was then arrested and swabbed for DNA. Neither informant testified against him at trial. Sitting at a table in his apartment in Williamsburg, Herskovic discussed the DNA evidence, first calmly and then indignantly. The white walls were bare except for a small mirror, a clock and a portrait of his children, who were scribbling in coloring books on the kitchen floor. He recalled how, when the police asked him to give a DNA sample, his lawyer cautioned him not to, but Herskovic went ahead and did so. I was the first one to give DNA, Herskovic said. He told me they needed it, I said, Go ahead, take it! It will be better. The DNA on Pattersons sneaker was pivotal to the case against Herskovic. Patterson testified that whoever pulled off his shoe had punched and kicked him. Although four other suspects were arrested, and several other men were identified by witnesses, seen on surveillance video, or had their license plates photographed at the scene, only Herskovic has been tried or sentenced to prison. Two people pleaded guilty to misdemeanors and were given probation; charges were dropped against the other two. Herskovics four-year sentence was stayed pending appeal. Hes working at an hourly job for a heating, ventilating and air-conditioning company to support his wife and two young children. His appeals lawyer, Donna Aldea, plans to argue that FST was never tested on a population as insulated as the Hasidic Jews of Williamsburg, who very likely share many of the same ancestors, and therefore much of the same DNA. This case is a poster-child for how DNA evidence can literally be fabricated out of thin air, and how statistics can be manipulated to create a false impression of scientific evidence of guilt, Aldea said. This must be exposed. Photo by Robert King/Hulton Archive/Getty Images",0,8,5
313,"In the summer of 1977, New York City was — literally and figuratively — on fire. It was the summer of disco fever, of Studio 54. It was the summer of Yankees mania. It was the summer that catapulted Ed Koch to City Hall. And in mid-July, it turned into the summer of darkness, when an epic, five-borough power outage — deemed an act of God by Con Ed — plunged the city into two days of total blackout. Airports shut down. News stations went off the air. Thousands were stuck in underground subway tunnels. Meanwhile, in the streets, the down-and-out — at their breaking point after years of municipal layoffs and a steady surge in violent crime — rioted and looted with abandon. Arsonists reportedly set more than 1,000 fires across the city in a single day. The Bronx, it would later be said, was burning. It was also the Summer of Sam. Want more local news? Sign up here to receive free newsletters and alerts from the New York City Patch. In spring 1977, police connected the dots and alerted the public: A serial killer known only as the Son of Sam — a name he gave himself in letters sent to the NYPD — had, for upward of a year by then, been stalking and killing beautiful young women and their lovers with his .44-caliber Bulldog revolver in the citys outer boroughs.  By July, the killer, later identified as 24-year-old postal worker and Bronx native David Berkowitz, had struck eight times. Six people were dead and another seven wounded, some of them maimed for life. Among the dead: college student Virginia Voskerichian, 19, shot as she walked home from school in Queens; Christine Freund, 26, shot while canoodling with her fiancé in a parked car, also in Queens (they had just returned from the cinema, where they saw Rocky, and were about to head to a late-night disco); and young couple Alexander Esau, 20, and Valentina Suriani, 18, likewise shot in their car, this time in the Bronx. Berkowitz had a type, police said. His targets were mostly young, white, middle-class women — the youngest just 16 years old — who wore their hair long and dark. The killer was also playful, in the sickest sense — taunting police and the public with notes and other tokens of his crimes. I love to hunt, he reportedly wrote in a letter to NYPD Captain Joseph Borrelli. Prowling the streets looking for fair game — tasty meat. The wemon of Queens are z prettyist of all [stet]. I must be the water they drink. I live for the hunt — my life. Blood for papa. With each unpredictable outburst, Sam boxed the city farther into a prison of fear. Nights were blazing hot, and AC wasnt cheap; still, many opted to stay indoors. Young women reportedly took to the salon en masse, asking their stylists to chop their hair short or dye it blonde. Spending a night on the town with a lover or taking a stroll home after dark were no longer carefree acts of summer living — they were acts of defiance. Sams reign of terror was given all the more reach by its bombastic coverage in the New York Post and the New York Daily News, the citys two leading tabloids. The Post and the Daily News were at the height of their rivalry that summer, media folks often recall, and were constantly trying to out-dramatize each other. NO ONE IS SAFE FROM SON OF SAM, screamed the Posts front page on Aug. 1. And when Daily News staffer Jimmy Breslin began receiving letters from the killer himself, the newspaper ran them in full. You can forget about me if you like because I dont care for publicity, one letter read. However, you must not forget [victim] Donna Lauria and you cannot let the people forget her either. She was a very sweet girl, but Sams thirsty lad and he wont let me stop killing until he gets his fill of blood. Berkowitz would later clarify what, exactly, his fill would have been: A mass shooting he planned to carry out at a Hamptons nightclub, leaving scores of pretty girls dead on the dance floor. He wanted to go down in a blaze of glory, he reportedly told police, and commit suicide by cop. Fortunately for a city in turmoil, it never came to that — thanks to a single parking ticket. According to a story on his capture in Time Magazine, the tip that would end the NYPDs epic manhunt for Sam — the largest the city had ever seen — came from a middle-aged woman in South Brooklyn who had been walking her dog, Snowball, on the night of his final attack. From the story: So, on the fated evening of Aug. 10, 1977 — 40 years ago on Thursday — a pair of homicide detectives headed to the Ford Galaxies registered address in Yonkers, a small town just north of the Bronx. Sure enough, parked in front of 35 Pine St., cops discovered the Ford in question. And on the front seat, in plain view, was a machine gun poking from a duffel bag labeled D. Berkowitz, according to the Post. The detectives knew then that they had their guy. The NYPD was waiting for Berkowitz outside his building when he emerged around 10 p.m. that night — carrying his alter egos signature .44-caliber revolver, no less. The killer confessed right away. Youve got me! he reportedly told police at the scene of his arrest. Who do I have? one detective asked. The Son of Sam, he replied. Berkowitzs photo was plastered across the citys newsstands by morning. And it didnt quite resemble the monster many had been picturing. The menacing Son of Sam was, as NYC crime reporter Murray Weiss later put it, in fact a a pudgy oddball postal worker with a meek, cherubic appearance. The public was confused, repulsed, fascinated: How had this average Joe from the Bronx transformed into the most infamous serial killer in New York City history? In subsequent conversations with police and prosecutors, Berkowitz would claim he had been following the orders of the devil, who had been speaking to him through Harvey, his neighbors dog. The name of this supposed neighbor? Sam. In old notebooks of his recovered by the NYPD, the troubled loner also bragged about starting hundreds of fires throughout the city. Experts would later opine that Berkowitzs descent into madness was set off by his discovery, a few years before he morphed into Sam, that he was adopted and had been abandoned by his birth mom. Things only got worse from there. Upon returning to NYC after a three-year stint in the U.S. Army, one biographer wrote, anger and frustration with women, coupled by a bizarre fantasy life, started him down the road to violence. You wouldnt believe how much some people hate me, Berkowitz reportedly wrote in a letter to his dad before the murders began. Many of them want to kill me. ... Most of them are young. I walk down the street and they spit and kick at me. The girls call me ugly and bother me the most. In the end, Berkowitz was found mentally competent to stand trial for his murders — and was convicted for each. Hes now serving an impossible series of life sentences that add up to hundreds of years in state prison. Never one to avoid the limelight, though, Berkowitz has granted various jailhouse interviews in his four decades behind bars. In them, he always claims to have found God: Hes tuned out the demons who drove him to kill, he says, and has accepted Jesus Christ into his life. His latest interview, recorded earlier this summer, will air on CBS this Friday, Aug. 11, at 10 p.m. ET/PT I see that people will never understand where I come from, no matter how much I try to explain it, Berkowitz told the news station. They wouldnt understand what it was like to walk in darkness. ... I was just very lost and confused. There was a battle going on inside me. He said he truly believed at the time that he was doing something to appease the devil. As far as Im concerned, that was not me, Berkowitz told CBS. That was not me. Even the name, I hate that name, I despise the name. ... That moniker, Son of Sam. That was not — that was a demon. Some have been more convinced by his turnaround than others. A bizarre deep dive in New York Magazine exactly 10 years ago, on the 30th anniversary of Berkowitzs arrest, profiled a growing flock of renegade Christians who — no joke — believed the reformed serial killer to be an apostle of the Lord. These are the names of the people he hurt and killed in the summer of 1977.

314,"A killer who strode up to a police vehicle and shot an officer dead in The Bronx Wednesday had ranted in a Facebook video last September about law officers killing and abusing people and warned them to leave him alone or we gonna do something. Im not playing, Mr. Officer. I dont care about 100 police watching this, 34-year-old ex-convict Alexander Bonds said, adding: Its time for people to wisen up. Ten months later, Bonds went up to the RV-like command post in the Bronx and ambushed Officer Miosotis Familia, shooting her through the passenger side window as she wrote in her notebook around 12:30 a.m. Police Commissioner James ONeill said Familia was assassinated in an unprovoked attack on cops. Familias partner frantically radioed for help, and officers caught up with Bonds about a block away and killed him in a hail of about 20 bullets when he pulled a stolen revolver, police said. He didnt get off a shot, authorities said. The burst of gunfire as the Fourth of July wound down was initially mistaken by some people for fireworks. The 48-year-old Familia was a 12-year veteran of the police force who spent her entire career with the New York Police Department in the high-crime Bronx precinct. The command post there had been set up and staffed around the clock since a triple shooting in March. Mayor Bill de Blasio said Familia was on duty serving this city, protecting people, doing what she believed in and doing the job she loved. Police said they were trying to establish the motive for the shooting. While tensions have been running high in recent years between police and black people around the country, there was no immediate indication the killing had a racial dimension. Bonds was black; Familia was black and Hispanic, her family having come from the Dominican Republic. She apparently had no previous contact with him. Still, the attack recalled the 2014 ambush killings of two New York officers who were gunned down in their cruiser by a man who had announced online moments before that he was planning to shoot two pigs in retaliation for the police chokehold death of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man. The gunman, 28-year-old Ismaaiyl Brinsley, then killed himself. Attorney General Jeff Sessions called Familias killing a murder in cold blood. Sadly, it is the latest in a troubling series of attacks on police officers over the past two years. These attacks must stop, he said in a statement. Bonds was seen on video leaving a convenience store, then moving tightly along the wall, pulling a hoodie over his head and walking purposefully toward the command post vehicle with gloved hands, police said. The video didnt capture the shooting but showed Bonds running away with a gun in his hand, police said. All new patrol cars rolled out by the NYPD have bulletproof glass, and older vehicles are being fitted with window inserts to harden them against gunfire. But there are no plans to do the same with the rolling command centers, officials said. Bonds, also known as John Bonds, had been paroled in 2013 after being sentenced to eight years in prison for a 2005 armed robbery in Syracuse. He had other arrests, including one in 2001, when as a teenager he was accused of attacking an officer with brass knuckles. While his Facebook page is filled largely with inspirational quotes and quizzes, he alluded to his troubled past. Just few years ago I was in the devil house, he noted in a New Years Eve post thanking God and people who had helped him. But months earlier, he posted his rambling tirade full of bitterness over how inmates are treated in prison. Dont think every brother, cousin, uncle you got that get killed in jail is because of a Blood or Crip or Latin King killing them. Nah, police be killing them and saying that an inmate killed them, he said in the video. Prison records show he had been written up more than two dozen times for disciplinary reasons behind bars, mostly for relatively minor infractions, but some for violations such as assaulting an inmate or fighting. Familia had three children, including twins, lived with her mother and worked the midnight shift. Friends said she became an officer to help her community, and her family was heartbroken. She was the sweetest person you ever want to meet, downstairs neighbor Tom Ritter said. He said his son, now 22, played with Familias children and she practically adopted him. Even a woman who said her husband had been arrested by Familia had only kind words for the slain officer. She gave me good advice, like a mother to a daughter, said Keisha Williams, who said her husband was arrested on a marijuana charge. Shes good, but shes a tough cookie. Shes a good cop. Im just sad it was her. Lead image courtesy of NYPD",1,8,0
315,"An NYPD officer and 9/11 first responder who went viral for his spontaneous dancing during the NYC Pride March in 2015 has died, according to his family. NYPD Officer Michael Hance died on Sunday of cancer, his brother told the New York Daily News. Hance served in the department for 17 years, including as a first responder after the 2001 terrorist attacks, according to his obituary. The NYPD confirmed to Patch that Hance was appointed in March of 2000. Hance became an internet celebrity when a clip of him dancing during the during the gay pride parade in 2015 went viral:  Hance, who was 44 when he died, lived in Bethpage, NY and worked in the 111th Precinct in Queens, according to the Daily News. He is survived by his two daughters and his fiance among other family members, according to his obituary. The Gay Officers Action League (GOAL) of New York has launched a fundraiser for Hances daughters. Although not a member of GOAL NY or the LGBTQ Community, he certainly brought a smile to all of our faces when he danced, the organizers wrote on the fundraisers page.

316,"An anonymous bomb threat was called into the Anti-Defamation Leagues NYC headquarters at 605 3rd Ave. on Wednesday morning, following a rash of bomb threats to Jewish centers throughout the country, according to police. There is no information at this time to indicate that this is more than a threat, ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said in a statement. Still, Gov. Andrew Cuomo has directed New York State Police to investigate the threat in tandem with local and federal law enforcement. The anonymous bomb threat to the Anti-Defamation Leagues national headquarters this morning is unacceptable, un-American and — disturbingly — increasingly common, Cuomo said in a statement. This despicable act of anti-Semitism completely contradicts the values we hold dear as New Yorkers. This is now a national crisis as a troubling pattern of recent anti-Semitic threats have been directed at Jewish Community Centers on a regular basis, including Buffalo, New York City, Albany, and Syracuse. The governor continued: We are treating these incidents for what they are — as crimes — and we will not allow them to go unpunished. The Anti-Defamation League, meanwhile, is working with law enforcement officials to determine if it is connected to similar threats against Jewish institutions across the country, the groups CEO said. The threat was called into ADLs Murray Hill headquarters at 11:08 a.m. Wednesday, according to police. We are investigating a possible bomb threat, an NYPD spokeswoman told Patch on Wednesday afternoon. I dont have any details yet, its too soon. Earlier in the week, on Monday, 11 Jewish community centers across the country received bomb threats — all of which were determined to be hoaxes, according to the Jewish Community Center Association of North America. While we are relieved that all such threats have proven to be hoaxes and that not a single person was harmed, we are concerned about the anti-Semitism behind these threats, and the repetition of threats intended to interfere with day-to-day life, the association wrote in a statement on Tuesday. Including Mondays wave of threats, there have been 68 bomb threats at 53 different Jewish community centers in the U.S. and Canada in 2017. President Donald Trump has largely avoided commenting on the uptick in anti-Semitic incidents since his election. He recently told a Jewish reporter who asked about the hate incidents to sit down. On Tuesday, though, Trump did tell NBC News: Anti-Semitism is horrible, and its gonna stop and it has to stop. This story has been updated to include additional details.

317,"Police arrested 19 rabbis who sat down in the street in front of the Trump International Hotel in an act of protest on Monday night, authorities said. For more updates on New York City protests and other news from New York City sent straight to your inbox, sign up for Patchs neighborhood news alerts here. The rabbis, protesting with the Jewish human rights group Truah, were arrested during a demonstration against Donald Trumps executive orders affecting immigrants and refugees. The group of 19 rabbis sat down in the roadway on 61st Street in front of the Columbus Circle hotel before they were arrested, according to Rabbi Jill Jacobs, Truahs executive director and one of those arrested on Monday night. It makes a statement when were willing to put our bodies on the line, Jacobs, 41, told Patch. Right now the people whose bodies are really on the line are people trying to get to America, and risking death to do so. The least that we can do is put our bodies a little bit on the line...to bring attention to the situation of refugees. The police department told Patch late on Monday night that charges were still pending, but most would be charged with disorderly conduct. Jacobs confirmed to Patch that 19 people were arrested and charged with disorderly conduct. Jacobs said that the group was given warnings by police to leave the roadway and that they were arrested when they remained on 61st Street. The protest began on Monday evening at 88th Street and Broadway with about 200 people marching south toward the Trump International Hotel. The demonstration was part of Truahs ongoing conference, which brought together rabbis from the U.S. and Canada. I can say for sure is that we certainly are going to keep up the pressure in this administration to do whats right, Jacobs said on Tuesday of Truahs future plans. The 19 rabbis arrested included rabbis from local synagogues in New York City as well as synagogues from around the country. Rabbi Sharon Kleinbaum of New York Citys Congregation Beit Simchat Torah was among those arrested. Im risking arrest today because America welcomed my own immigrant family to its shores, as it did millions of families before us who fled persecution, Kleinbaum said in a statement. The protest was organized in support of immigrants and refugees and in opposition to Trumps executive orders that target them. On Jan. 27, the president signed an executive order banning travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries and suspending the United States refugee program for 120 days, among other actions. Trumps order has been suspended by an emergency restraining order granted by a federal judge in Seattle. Whats happening now is morally wrong, and thats the role of clergy, Jacobs told Patch. Religion is something thats supposed to be out on the streets with the people. Last month, Truah released a statement condemning the executive order and voicing support for the Muslim, Arab, and Asian communities most directly affected. As Jews, who know what it means to be targeted by discriminatory laws, we stand firmly with refugees fleeing war, persecution, and economic strife, they said in the statement.

318,"The New York City Police Department is now letting some officers wear turbans and grow out their beards a little more for religious reasons. Each is an important aspect of some religions, and a handful of police departments across the country have already made similar changes. For example, Sikh officers in the NYPD had to wear a smaller-sized wrap under the standard police caps. Now, they can forgo the caps and have police brass fastened to a navy blue turban. SEE MORE: Obama Ends Muslim And Arab Registry Program Before Trump Can Revive It Were making this change to make sure that we allow everybody in New York City that wants to apply and have the opportunity to work in the greatest police department in the nation, to make sure that were giving them that opportunity, NYPD Commissioner James ONeill said. Specifically, the new policy lets officers grow beards up to half an inch, with approval. But some in the Sikh community argue that change doesnt go far enough. The NYPD says longer facial hair doesnt work with certain gas masks. The department currently employs around 150 Sikh officers and 1,000 Muslims. Photo courtesy of Newsy",0,8,5
319,"EAST HARLEM, NEW YORK — A black man was slashed several times in the face and stabbed in the arm on Christmas night by a woman to whom he offered his seat on the subway, police confirmed to Patch. Witnesses and police sources told the New York Post, which first reported the incident, that the victim was a transgender man, but the NYPD would not confirm that to Patch. The 44-year-old victim offered his seat to 30-year-old Stephanie Pazmino, whose cousin he was sitting next to, so she could sit next to her, the NYPD said. Pazmino replied, I dont want your seat. Then she said to her cousin in Spanish, I dont want to sit next to a black person, cops said. A verbal dispute erupted between Pazmino and the man, and the victim got up and sat in the row across from the two women. Police said they didnt have a record of what was said in the verbal dispute. When the train arrived at 125th Street station at around 11:20 p.m., Pazmino approached the victim and slashed him several times in the left side of his face with a 2-inch knife and stabbed him in his left arm, according to the NYPD. A witness on the subway took the victim off the train and onto the platform, where police then arrived and arrested Pazmino, witnesses told the New York Post. Pazmino was charged with assault as a hate crime, reckless endangerment, and criminal possession of a weapon, police said. Paramedics rushed the conscious and alert victim to Harlem Hospital, where he was treated for non-life-threatening injuries, the NYPD and FDNY confirmed.

320,"Sara Seweid, sister of Yasmin Seweid, the Muslim teen accused by the NYPD of making up a story about being attacked and harassed in the NYC subway, took to Facebook to say local cops and reporters have made the situation unbearable for her family, according to a screencap of the post. The original public Facebook post has since been deleted or made private. Yasmin Seweid, an 18-year-old Baruch College student from Long Island, was arrested Wednesday on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, after detectives who had been investigating her story came to the conclusion that she had been lying all along. The entire story is false, an NYPD spokesman told Patch Wednesday. Yasmins sister, Sara, appeared to write a briefly public Facebook post on Thursday that was highly critical of the NYPD. She said cops had leaked private information Yasmin had told them to the media, and that they were insensitive and doubtful of Yasmin from the beginning. The NYPD should have never been involved in the first place even if the incident did happen, Sara wrote, according to the screencap shared widely on Twitter. It became super clear to me these past two week that the polices first instinct is to doubt your story and try to disprove it. The post went on to say the NYPD told Sara, Yasmin and their family members that it didnt look good that they had been vocal about certain issues that the NYPD perceived to be anti-Trump, anti-white and anti-men. How is this an appropriate comment by an officer investigating a possible hate crime? That Muslims cant seek help from the state if they are critical of it in any capacity? the post said. According to the post, reporters then made the situation worse by camping out in front of the familys home for days and spreading false rumors. My sister may have lied but she has dealt with an unsurmountable amount of violence and trauma both publicly and privately these past two weeks, the post said. Yasmin has been charged with two misdemeanor crimes, an NYPD spokesman told Patch: first, filing a false police report, and second, obstructing governmental administration. Yasmin originally told police she was attacked around 10 p.m. on Thursday, Dec. 1, in the 23rd Street subway station near her school by a trio of white, male 20-somethings who shouted Donald Trump! and tried to remove her hijab, or headscarf.

321,"NEW YORK CITY — District Attorneys representing New York Citys five boroughs released a joint statement Tuesday to condemn a national rise in hate crimes and swear to prosecute vigorously crimes that are motivated by bias and hate. New Yorks top prosecutors — Richard Brown of Queens, Cyrus Vance of Manhattan, Darcel Clark of the Bronx, Michael McMahon of Staten Island and acting District Attorney Eric Gonzalez of Brooklyn — also denounced a rise in hate crimes reported in the city since Donald Trumps victory in the presidential election. Within the past week, our offices have become aware of multiple incidents where New Yorkers received threatening messages related to their race or religion, and we are carefully monitoring these reports, read the letter. Racism, misogyny and xenophobia have reared their heads in the city since Trumps unexpected victory. In the past week a Trump supporter punched a woman in the face after a political argument, a swastika was painted in a Jewish section of Crown Heights and a man wearing a Make America Great Again hat was throttled in the Bronx. But the rise in intolerance and hate crimes is not limited to New York and has not just occurred within the past week. Its been building throughout the country for at least a year. An FBI report released Monday stated that between 2014 and 2015 the recorded number of hate crimes rose 6.8 percent in the United States. Of the 7,121 victims of hate crimes in 2015, 59.2 percent were targeted by race, 19.7 percent were targeted by religion, 17.7 percent were targeted by sexual orientation, 1.7 percent were targeted by gender identity, 1.2 percent were targeted by disability and 0.4 percent were targeted by gender, according to FBI data. Here is the full statement from the five New York City District Attorneys: New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo also responded to the rise in hate crimes Tuesday by setting up a hotline to report crimes of bias and discrimination. Cuomo also announced Tuesday that he will launch multi-agency investigations into reported hate crimes and instruct the state Education Department to train teachers hoe to protect New Yorks children from the growing wave of intolerance. New York serves as a beacon of hope and opportunity for all, and we will continue to stand up to those who seek to spread the politics of division, fear and hate, Cuomo said in a statement.

322,"The self-proclaimed actress who threw crickets and worms everywhere on a subway car at rush hour was taken into custody by police early Tuesday afternoon, according to an NYPD spokesperson. There were no charges filed against her as of Tuesday at 1:45 p.m., the NYPD said. Zaida Pugh, the woman who pulled the prank last Wednesday to make a statement about how the public treats people with mental illness, filmed a Facebook live Tuesday morning saying she was afraid for her life because of the angry backlash against her. There are people that really hate me…probably want me dead, she said. I dont want that. Thats not the type of attention I wanted…I just really had a dream and I wanted it to go far. I wanted to spread messages out there, and I didnt want it to happen like this. Commenters on her Facebook live were torn. Lord help me if I was on that train because Im terrified of bugs. Without The bugs wouldve been ok or more acceptable. You have to understand that there are people out there that would go into cardiac arrest when you release them bugs, one commenter wrote. People dont hate you Zaida, you have a lot of people who follow you, stay strong and stuff the haters, another wrote. When the police found out it was a prank, they sought a warrant for her arrest, the New York Post reported. NYPD Chief Robert Boyce said Tuesday: Pugh caused a panic on the D train last week when she started screaming and threw crickets and worms everywhere, and she urinated on the train and pretended to throw up when some men tried to hold her down. A passenger pulled the emergency brake, and the train car came to a halt on the Manhattan Bridge. Passengers were anxious in a car full of jumping insects and no air conditioning. Several police officers were at the DeKalb stop waiting to take her into custody when the train car arrived at the station. They gave her a psychiatric evaluation and didnt charge her.

323,"OZONE PARK, Police have charged a Brooklyn man in the killing of a Queens imam and his associate after he was identified and held on unrelated charges of a hit-and-run that took place roughly three miles from the scene of the homicide, city officials said. Late Monday night, the NYPD announced the arrest of 35-year-old Oscar Morel, of Brooklyn. Morel faces two counts of second-degree murder and two counts of criminal possession of a weapon. NYPD Chief of Detective Robert Boyce said at a press conference earlier Monday evening detectives conducted a video canvas around 3:50 p.m. at 79th Street and Liberty Avenue through which they identified a black GMC trailblazer that the male suspect reportedly used to flee eastbound after the double homicide. After investigating, detectives were able to identify a hit-and-run involving the same car that reportedly took place at the corner of Pine Street and Pitkin Avenue in Brooklyn. Boyce said video pulled from the scene of the hit-and-run showed that the cars were identical. After a grid search, detectives located the car in the vicinity of the hit-and-run and saw a person emerge around 10 p.m. Sunday and approached the car. Boyce said as authorities approached the car, the 35-year-old East New York man rammed the detectives car several times in an attempt to get away. He was placed under arrest, and a witness to the hit-and-run identified the man. Were looking at him for both crimes, Boyce said.  Imam Maulama Akonjee and his associate Thara Uddin had left a prayer service at the Al-Furqan Jame Masjid mosque when they were approached from behind and shot dead just before 2 p.m. on Saturday. Both men were dressed in traditional Muslim garb at the time of the shooting. Boyce said the NYPD had still not determined a motive in the shooting but said they had not ruled out the possibility of a hate crime. Right now we cant explain why he was there, Boyce said. He was there just prior to that, we have him on video about eight minutes prior to the homicide. Police recovered a .38 caliber Taurus revolver in connection with the double homicide. Speaking at the press conference, Mayor Bill de Blasio said he assured members of the Bangladeshi community and the Muslim community that the killer would be brought to justice. Its also clear theres a lot of fear in the community, de Blasio said. Its a very rare thing to see a cleric killed, and members of the Muslim community have been on edge because of the atmosphere already that existed in this country, particularly over the last few months in our national debate. Members of the NYPD, the mayor said, would be out in full force protecting community institutions and protecting Muslim communities all over the city.

324,"More than 40 mobsters from four crime families have been arrested in a wide-ranging mafia bust, according to a federal grand jury indictment released Thursday. The mobsters were members of the Genovese, Gambino, Luchese and Bonanno families. The indictment listed 46 people as members of the East Coast LCN Enterprise, which engaged in crimes including extortion, arson, fraud, firearms trafficking and illegal gambling, among other crimes. In this case, LCN stands for La Cosa Nostra, another way of saying the mafia. The indictment stated that the criminal enterprise operated along the East Coast including in New York City, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Florida. The enterprise was composed of members of the Genovese, Gambino, Luchese, Bonanno and the Philadelphia Organized Crime Family, according to the federal indictment. The charges applied today to these 46 individuals deal a significant blow to La Cosa Nostra, which the NYPD is committed to putting out of business, said NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton. As alleged, in typical mob fashion, the rackets ran from Springfield to South Florida and left no scheme behind. These mobsters seemed to use every scheme known to us, from arson, to shake-downs, violence, health care fraud, and even untaxed cigarettes to keep the racket going. Three of the accused mobsters — Pasquale Parello, Joseph Merlino and Eugene ONofrio — were identified as the supervisors of the illegal enterprise in the indictment.  Merlino is none other than Skinny Joey Merlino, former boss of the Philadelphia crime family. Merlino, the son of mob underboss Chuckie Merlino, rose to prominence in the 1990s and has been implicated in several murders and attempted murders, according to the Philly Voice. Merlino was convicted of racketeering in 2001 but beat charges for drugs, murder and attempted murder. Parello, another one of the ringleaders, played a role in the 2011 assault of a homeless person in the Bronx. Parello owned a restaurant in the Bronx at the time, and he thought the panhandler was harassing his customers. In the most mob fashion ever, Parello ordered Anthony Zinzi to break his knees, according to the indictment. Another alleged mafioso, Israel Torres, threatened a man he believed was the panhandler (but really wasnt) before returning with other goons to assault the man using glass jars, sharp objects and steel-tipped boots, according to the indictment. Also arrested was Genovese Capo Conrad Ianiello, a bit of mob royalty. His uncle — Matthew Matty the Horse Ianiello — was a long-time power in the crime family, even serving as acting boss of the family at one point. Matty the Horse was an owner of Umbertos Clam House in Little Italy and was said to have been in the kitchen when one of the most famous mob hits — the assassination of Joey Gallo — took place. Matty the Horse also inadvertently played a very large role in the history of the modern gay rights movement. In the 1960s, when it was illegal to operate a gay bar or nightclub, Ianiello and the Genovese Family controlled several — including the now-famous Stonewall Inn. The New York police commander who led the June 1969 raid on the Stonewall that set off the riot said the raid was targeting the mafia, not the gay patrons of the bar. Conrad has been no slouch when it comes to the family business. Two years ago he pleaded guilty to conspiring with trying to force one union from trying to organize workers at a chocolate factory on Long Island so another union could move in. He also has convictions going back to at least 1972 when he was sentenced to five years probation after being convicted of grand larceny. One element of the criminal operation was the Yonkers Club, where the enterprise ran a casino-style gambling club that held poker tournaments and took bets on horse races, according the indictment. Two members of the enterprise working at the Yonkers Club, Mark Maiuzzo and Anthony Zinzi, set fire to a car parked outside a nearby competitors operation, according to the indictment. The criminal enterprise stretched as far as Costa Rica, where it ran a sports gambling operation named the Costa Rican International Sportsbook, according to the indictment. Of those arrested 27 resided in New York, four in New Jersey, two in Massachusetts, seven in Florida, three in prison, one in Costa Rica, on in Connecticut and one mobsters residence was listed as unknown. Todays charges against 46 men, including powerful leaders, members and associates of five different La Cosa Nostra families, demonstrate that the mob remains a scourge on this city and around the country, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said. In an unrelated incident, John Gotti — the grandson of the former Gambino family crime boss with the same name — was arrested for state narcotics charges, according to the Queens District Attorney. Gotti, along with six others, were arrested by the NYPD for selling Oxycodone and other pharmaceutical controlled substances in the Howard Beach area of Queens.

325,"Pictured: NYPD Chief of Department James ONeill, speaking Friday, with Mayor Bill de Blasio, left, and NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton, right. Photo by John V. Santore ONE POLICE PLAZA, MANHATTAN — NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton on Friday said the shooting of 12 police officers in Dallas, Texas, five fatally, must serve as a catalyst to try to continue [the] healing process that will bring police forces and community members together around the United States. That attack, Bratton said, was reminiscent of the apparent revenge shooting of NYPD officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos, killed in Bed-Stuy in December 2014 by a gunman who had posted online, Im Putting Wings On Pigs Today. The Dallas attack, Bratton said, needs to be a clarion call to take seriously the grievances that many in the minority community have about policing, as well as a motivator driving civilians to understand the fears and concerns shared by cops on the beat. We need to find common ground, Bratton said, adding that in 45 years in the business, Ive never seen anything quite like the premeditated Texas killings. He then added, We cannot tolerate racial injustice, or injustice directed against police forces. The assault took place during a large, peaceful protest against police brutality, itself a response to several recent police shootings of black men, including Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and Philando Castille in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Mayor Bill de Blasio described the shootings as an evil and unacceptable attack that was an attempt to undermine our values [and] everything our democracy is about. The Dallas officers, de Blasio said, were on duty protecting the protesters rights, and they protected the protesters even as bullets were hailing down, a demonstration of all that is good about our police and the work they do. On Thursday, about 1,000 people associated with the Black Lives Matter movement took to the streets in Manhattan in protest against police brutality, leading to dozens of arrests. De Blasio asked those protesting in the future to obey the law. He also asked all New Yorkers to be aware of that pain felt by officers after the events in Dallas, and to take a moment to thank them for their work. NYPD officials said the department was monitoring about 15 threats made against its personnel, often on social media, since the shooting of Alton Sterling, though none had been deemed credible. Bratton said that for the time being, all officers will go on patrol with a partner, while auxiliary officers, who dont have guns, will be pulled off the streets for their safety. The mayor said that in light of the shootings, the city will redouble our efforts to bring police and community together. And even while Bratton described tensions between communities and their police forces as a continuing crisis in this country that needs to be addressed, both he and the mayor sought to hold New York City apart. The citys increasing embrace of community policing, in which officers are dedicated to specific segments of their precincts, is helping to improve trust and drive down crime to historic lows, they said. Bratton said that more than half of the NYPDs 36,000 officers live in New York, and therefore arent an occupying army in the city. And in 2015, Bratton said, cops only used their weapons 65 times. About 36 of those incidents involved a combat situation, he said. Such reassurances contrasted sharply with the tone of a Wednesday protest in East New York following the death of Delrawn Small, shot by off-duty NYPD officer Wayne Isaacs. The incident is being investigated by New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. That protest, while passionate and highly critical of the NYPD, was also peaceful, though Assemblyman Charles Barron offered words that took on a new meaning following the fatalities in Dallas. Weve had death by those who are paid to protect us, Barron said at the rally. If you ignore all of our peaceful efforts for justice, violence is inevitable. Update: A second press conference, this time held in the NYPDs Joint Operations Center, was attended by Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson. Jeh Johnson, center. Photo by John V. Santore  Johnson said that high-profile cases of police misconduct have a huge impact on public perception of law enforcement, and represent setbacks very clearly. Even so, Johnson said he believes that most Americans appreciate and respect the police officers in their communities, adding that on a daily basis, law enforcement [and] public safety works around the country. Bratton urged those protesting the police to take a step back and think of positive ways to correct the issues so many people have concerns about, noting that public safety is a collective, shared responsibility, not the work of just one segment of society. There are a lot of people who are angry and anxious, Johnson said. However, he continued, just like the shooter does not represent the broader spectrum of people who want change, any police officer who engages in excessive force does not represent the law enforcement community at large. Asked if there were structural changes that police forces should implement to improve their relations with the public, Johnson said federal law enforcement has worked to build bridges with communities around the country, especially Muslim Americans, while Bratton repeated that good policing all starts and ends with trust.",1,8,0

This was in response to his Perry Gershon political campaign yard sign, he said. Also found was his wifes name, a cross and a Jewish star, he said. Gershon, a Democrat, is facing off against Rep. Lee Zeldin, a Republican for his congressional seat. What say you, Lee Zeldin? the post asked. Also reportedly found at the site were the words, Cynthia Nixon, Go Home, Silverbush and Padhma, he said; he is married to Lori Silverbush. The incident sparked a sea of supportive comments for Colicchio and his wife on social media.   Silverbush also posted on Twitter about the incident. Woke up this a.m. to a swath of hate speech painted across the property I share with Tom Colicchio and our 2 little boys, she wrote. Cute touch: my name & a defaced Jewish star. Wake up USA: POTUS tacitly applauds tis. This is whats at stake in the upcoming elections. Rep. Lee Zeldin reacted to the graffiti in a Facebook post: I dont know who did this, but this coward needs to be identified and prosecuted, he said. I have no idea who this particular couple who lives there supports in the Democratic Party primary for Governor, but regardless, they should not be targeted for their political views one way or the other and especially referencing their religion as well was totally unacceptable and laced with hate. Settle your scores at the ballot box in our great country! He added: There is no place whatsoever for actions like this in our political discourse. Speaking from personal experience, as someone who is Jewish and yet still has been disgustingly called a Nazi and Nazi sympathizer a few thousand times in the past 12 months, and having been targeted and my family targeted several times with death threats in the last year and a half, I know all too well what it is like to be the recipient of this hate and it is horrible and must end in our great country. Just a few weeks ago, Zeldin said, one of his campaign volunteers was attacked, threatened with death and nearly run over by a car by an individual who was a left wing opponent of my politics and fortunately was arrested and charged with a felony and misdemeanor. This needs to end. Again . . . settle your score at the ballot box, not like this. Sonia Spar and Val Shelby, co-chairs of the Southold Town Anti-Bias Task Force, responded to the graffiti: Its very troubling that we have seen recent acts of bigoted graffitti in Mattituck and vandalism against the Greeek Orthodox Church in Greenport. The hateful messages that these actions send to our community cannot be met with silence. Our community of Southold Town must come together to strongly denounce this attack against the respect and human dignity that underlies these actions. As the new school year begins, our actions must clearly convey to our children that we stand as a community against all bigotry and for civility, respect and human dignity.

327,"SOUTHOLD, NY— Southold School Superintendent David Gamberg spoke out Sunday about an alleged shooting threat that he said never involved students or staff in the district. On Friday, a post on social media mentioned an alleged threat involving the possible shooting of Christians and Catholics. According to Southold Town Police Chief Martin Flatley, the incident, where a post referenced shooting others from Christian or Catholic religious groups, was reported by Southold High School Thursday, fully investigated, and found to be non-criminal and not a threat, he said. Gamberg explained the chain of events to Patch: We became aware of a post and reported it to the police. Nowhere in the post was there any threat to any student or staff member at Southold High School. Yes, it made a reference to the Pope and religion that was concerning, but not a threat to our school, he said. For the schools part, we reacted immediately, gave the information to the police, and within 90 minutes a determination was made by the police. Board of Education member Judi Fouchet also said that police determined there was absolutely no threat made to the school community or anyone else. Just an overabundance of caution on the schools part in reporting something to the police, as they should. But investigation made it really a non reportable issue. Gamberg sent out an email to parents after the story appeared on Patch: There was never any threat directed at the Southold learning community. The police investigated the matter and at no time was there any reason to regard the safety of anyone in our school community to be in jeopardy. The safety and well being of all who attend, work, and visit our schools is always our first and most important concern. Tensions have been high nationwide after the Parkland, FL shooting and a most recent shooting in Texas Friday that left 10 dead. Patch file photo.",0,8,5
328,"History was made in Greenport Village Thursday night as, before a standing room only crowd that packed the firehouse, trustees voted unanimously 5 to 0 to declare Greenport a welcoming community. During a time when the nation is rife with acrimony over the raging immigration issue, the designation means that Greenport has openly declared itself a place that welcomes all and celebrates the diversity of those who live in the village. The vote came after some debate on the proposal, which was pitched by Trustee Doug Roberts at last weeks village board work session — but was a decision lauded by a large segment of the community who took to the podium and said it will earn the village a forever legacy as a group of men and women who stood firmly and with conviction on the right side of history. The line of speakers was long Thursday night, a large majority pouring their hearts into pleas with the village board to adopt the resolution. Former Greenport Mayor David Kapell was first up at the podium. He said the resolution dances around a very serious challenge for the village but doesnt hit the nail on the head. Nearly 20 percent of all village residents, Kapell said, are under threat of deportation after President Donald Trumps new executive orders. In addition, Kapell said, 75 percent of kids in the Greenport school come from these families. Of the immigrants, he said, The vast majority are decent, hardworking people trying to make a life for themselves, their family, their children. Their labor is the backbone of the village and North Fork economy. Without them, the village economy will tank and the school will be forced to close. The village, Kapell said, did not create the problem; it is, he said, the result of a dysfunctional immigration system that works as well as a screen door on a submarine. While he said he agreed the border needs to be secured and criminals must go, to lose 20 percent of the villages population and 75 percent of the children in the school district, would be an unmitigated disaster for our village. Kapell called on Trump, Congress and Senate to enact comprehensive immigration reform.  Kathryn Quigley said the issue was critical. Its not often that things are happening in the federal government that so directly affect our small little community here in Greenport. This resolution is symbolic, but symbols have a lot of power. She read a statement from her husband David, who reflected on the things hes never had to fear: That my children wouldnt have a parent to put them to bed, that my elderly mother or father would be ripped from the life theyve been living for 30 years. That when I leave in the morning, it might be the last time I see my wife. That rushing to the hospital brought with it the added danger of deportation. . .or that my children might be taunted for the color of their skin. He said, while some may consider the resolution a token gesture, they should ask themselves if they have ever felt those fears.  Resident suggests others report obstruction of justice Resident Robert Kehl disagreed. I still dont believe this village should have to draft any resolution to declare the Village of Greenport a welcoming village. If you are here legally, you are always welcome. He then held up a sign with a phone number, where residents could call and report an obstruction of justice as far as immigration laws, employers that employ illegal aliens, anyone renting to illegal aliens, and aiding and abetting, and this includes the clergy. His comments were met with a noticeable outcry from the crowd assembled. Make sure you mention Doug Roberts by name, Kehl said. We want to make sure Mr. Roberts gets all the credit he deserves. Outpouring of support Resident Dinni Gordon said some of the opposition expressed at the work session seemed to be based on the assumption that to declare the village a welcoming community would suggest a previous attitude that we werent welcoming. I see a much more affirmative purpose. As a nation, were in a very anxious time. The federal government, she said, has announced a dragnet that will inevitably sweep up neighbors, colleagues, employees and employers. We cant reject the mandates of local and national law enforcement and this resolution is not trying to do that. But we can send a message to vulnerable residents that we appreciate their contributions and are concerned about their future. Immigration attorney Chris Worth said he saw someone waving a flag in Greenport and running. Of the flag, he said, You know what it means to me now? It means Trump. It means get rid of the immigrants. That is the symbol of our country. His remarks sparked anger among Greenport residents who said the individual was a part of the community, a member of the military, and the flag represented not only the president but the history of the nation and all the lives lost, represented in its stripes. He later apologized for losing his temper and said no dialogue is possible if anger overcomes civility. Greenport resident Margaret Cowden said she was attracted initially to Greenport by its diversity. The Statue of Liberty has always been a welcoming image to me, she said. Im deeply concerned by the voices in this country that seem to want to extinguish that flame of welcome. Robin Goodman of Orient said not only was the resolution a symbolic gesture, but anecdotal evidence suggests that welcoming communities experience economic benefits. I dont see what Greenport could stand to lose, she said. While it doesnt imply that it hasnt been a welcoming community beforehand, voting it down would send a message that its not, and wouldnt be, in the future. Liz Smith of Greenport added, This is beyond immigration. Words matter. What makes me upset is the words us and them. Its hateful. She added, Stop the hate speech because ultimately what unites us is far more than what divides us. Greenports Penelope Rudder added, We need to prioritize the human beings. Its the human beings that are going to create the sustainable life here. We need to open our hearts up, because this is our villages heart, these human beings. I dont think the heart of the matter, in anything, should be left as an assumption. She added that shed looked up the definition of the word fear, and the exact opposite was trust. Ellen Neff of Greenport said the historical perspective needs to be considered. She herself has Irish and German roots and her ancestors found similarly unsettling times in the 1880s. New immigration law, she said, will come. Greenport, she said, is diverse. Its a good place to be and its not ever going to be just one kind of place.  This goes both ways Greenport resident Chatty Allen, a school bus driver, said she was upset by Worths remark about the flag. Im not a Trump supporter. I dont agree with what hes doing. But to have one of my kids — hes not biologically mine, but hes one of my kids — carrying the American flag and have negativity shown at him . . . yet you have people here feeling they are the ones being attacked. This goes both ways. Near tears, Allen said she was born and raised in Greenport. Greenport has welcomed everyone. Why do we have to have a resolution or a proclamation? And then it turns into me, being a white female, against someone of color. Thats not what Greenport is, but thats what this resolution has brought out. People like me are afraid to speak out because if we say something, we are racist and hateful, Allen said. She reminded that Greenport cannot be a sanctuary city because it does not have its own police department. The proposed resolution, Allen believes, has divided the community. Teresa Taylor of Greenport, meanwhile, said that in the early 1900s, Italian immigrants were called wops, which stood for without papers. She said she and others who feel safe have been lucky to have been blessed by the birth lottery and not much more than that. Our ancestors were not all legal. Not just the legal should be blessed. Immigrants should be loved, and I hope that this resolution will reflect that sense of love for each other. Greenport resident Arthur Tasker eloquently quoted Martin Neimoller, a Protestant pastor who spoke out against Hitler and wrote the famous words, First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out—Because I was not a Socialist. Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out— Because I was not a Trade Unionist. Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out— Because I was not a Jew. Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me. Sonia Spar, co-chair of the Southold Anti-Bias Task Force, said the more individuals get to know one another the less bias, hatred and prejudice, because we see them as humans. She added, We need to understand the direct connection between the language we use and the environment we live in. Words matter. Southold Town and ABTF, she said, are working to foster respect and civility. Prejudice and bias leads to hatred. Hatred, left unchecked leads to hateful action. Not good, in a country where hate crimes are still on the rise, she said. Greenport, she added, is a destination marked by diversity, not just by Latino immigrants but by the LGBTQ community, Muslims, refugees, and Jewish residents. People coming need to make sure our core values are respected. I am more and more scared when I see Confederate flags on motorcycles. This is a positive message, taking a stand when hatred is going unchecked, Spar said. A village divided Peter Harris said two grandparents immigrated to America from Poland and were treated like second class citizens. The thing that bothers me the most when we supposedly have upstanding citizens that rent, and are putting two, three, four families in a single family home, lining their own pockets. And Greenport has to be a welcoming community? Welcoming for what? To make a buck. Greenport resident Bill Wright said the issue of security hadnt been discussed. There are many illegal immigrants in the United States that havent been properly vetted, he said. I have no hatred for anyone. Welcome to America. But we need to give the current administration a chance to deal with it, because no other administration has been willing to; theyve just passed the buck. We need to give the administration in Washington a chance to deal with this so we can come together and have a reasonable solution. Not all immigrants are Latino, said Mattitucks Art Tillman, also the Southold Town Democratic Committee Chair. He said hes Czech, and he knows many Polish immigrants who are also terrified they will be deported. He said individuals need to take their fundamental faith, the faith they were brought up with, and take it into the world. Of the resolution, he said, Jesus said if you have a candle, dont hide it under a bushel. Let the world see. Others urged the board to vote with their hearts. Sag Harbors Minerva Perez, executive director of Organizacion Latino-Americana, or OLA, does diversity training with the Southampton Town Police. She shared a heartfelt story about an Latino teen who wants to be a Navy SEAL and then, come home to serve in the East Hampton Town Police Department.  This is our future. These children want to do nothing but be American, to serve and die for our country — whether their parents are undocumented or not, she said. To the board, she said, There is bravery in this room, even to have this conversation is brave. I want to take this back to the South Fork, as a model. Voices of opposition Greenports Joanne McEntee said most of those speaking were not Greenport residents, or do not regularly attend village meetings. She said there are criminals in the village, people who have come into the country illegally; she also brought up MS-13 gangs and said the resolution does not address illegal immigrants that have committed crimes. She said homeowners were bearing the heavy weight of taxes for the large percentage of schoolchildren enrolled whose parents are in the country illegally. Of Trump, she said, He may not be what we like, or what you dont like, but he is our president. Weve all accepted presidents in the past and we need to accept the president as he is today. The biggest issue here tonight is not immigrants. The biggest issue is illegal immigrants, she said. And, she said, her kids make less working in restaurants on the books than illegal immigrants paid in cash. She also urged the board not to make Greenport a dumping ground, as it was in past years. History is going to remember us Susan Dingle, also a member of the Southold ABTF, said she was moved by the outpouring and courage in the room Thursday night. You have before you a great opportunity to share the loving heart of Greenport with the wider world. We need your example, Dingle said. By adopting the resolution, Greenport would be serving as an example for other municipalities, she said. Carolyn Peabody, of the Southold ABTF said she agreed with others who had spoken. History is going to remember us. We would really want to be on the side of supporting people, human life, in doing the right thing. Historic vote Before the vote, Trustee Mary Bess Phillips said she was happy Roberts initial wording was changed a bit — the words foreign born were changed to now just say all Greenport residents — to reflect the true spirit of what we are in the Village of Greeenport. We are Greenport. We are all in it together and we all take care of each other. Roberts said he was happy with Mayor George Hubbards edits and said he, himself, was welcomed to Greenport from Northport 10 years ago. My goal was not we and they, but us. Not us and them, just us, my neighbors, Roberts said. The resolution was not intended to say to any of you that you havent welcomed people. Its about asking you to join in a symbolic statement. Trustee Julia Robins said she was honored to be able to vote. Somebody said to do the right thing. This is whats in my heart. I pray for this community to heal. I pray for this community to heal. I hope we can come together. The vote passed unanimously After the vote, Roberts told Patch, It was a great night to be a Greenporter. I ended up hugging about 10 or 12 people I barely knew last night after the meeting. Thats what being a true Greenporter is all about. Thank you to everyone for coming out, and thank you to Mayor Hubbard for his leadership and ability to bring us all together. Photos screenshots from televised Greenport Village board meeting.",0,8,5
329,"A small group of residents turned out Monday to air their concerns regarding a new beer production facility proposed for Oregon Road in Cutchogue. A public hearing was held at the Southold Town Planning Board meeting Monday on a site plan application by Threes Brewing East. The application calls for the proposed construction of a 100 x 65, or 6,500 square foot, steel building for production — brewery, with no retail — office and storage, with 21 parking stalls on 0.96 acres in the towns light industrial zoning district in Cutchogue. The parcel is located at 12820 Oregon Road, on the south corner of Cox Lane and Oregon Road. Attorney Charles Cuddy, representing Threes Brewing East, said the proposed application has already been approved by the towns Architectural Review Committee and was permitted under current zoning code on the site. Neighbor Jennifer Bank said she lives diagonally across from the proposed operation and has lived in her home for 23 years. She asked about plans for access in and out of the facility, which would have trucks moving product. She said she was fearful of a blind curve. Trucks wont see us and we wont see them, she said. She also asked whether or not a traffic study about the impact of the increased traffic and said her primary concern was safety. Oregon Road is not super busy and this is going to impact that particular sector of Oregon Road, she said. Southold Planning Board Vice Chairman James Rich said the board would not answer questions directly at the hearing but would include the questions in its research. Bank added that it was important that research into visuals and other traffic concerns be done, with an eye toward safety. People will be coming to work, and jobs are a great thing, but we need to be careful because this is something very new to this spot, she said. Greg Doroski, head brewer and managing partner in Threes Brewing, which has its retail location on Douglass Street in Brookyn, said the road in question is the road for the entire subdivision, with other businesses likely to be utilizing that road, as well. We are definitely willing to work with the community, he said, adding that the facility is meant for production, with trucks coming in and out between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m., normal business hours. Doroski said vehicles would access the facility from Cox Lane, and he did not foresee vehicles exiting onto Oregon Road. It doesnt make sense from our standpoint and our neighbors standpoint. Trucks, he said, have more than enough space to turn. It shouldnt pose an issue.  He added that other establishments are operating in the same facility.  He anticipated weekly, not daily, deliveries, Doroski said. When asked by Rich if the proposal absolutely had no retail component, Doroski answered, This is about manufacturing. Threes Brewing, he said, has an 8,000 square foot retail establishment in Brooklyn, but does not have the ability to produce enough beer right now for the site in Brooklyn and for retail partners. Theres a big demand right now for our beer and we feel a sense of urgency to get this production facility up and running, before someone else jumps in and does, at our expense, Doroski said. We are willing to sit down and work through what works best for everyone. Lora Schiavetta of Oregon Road said there had been no sign of a public hearing until the day before; she did not believe the wind had knocked any signs down announcing the hearing. In addition, she said Oregon was very rural. We dont want another Vineyard 48. Schiavetta said she was worried because Threes Brewing East had submitted an application in the past for a retail component that would have been open to the public, and she was fearful they could do so again. We have asked repeatedly if there was retail and they said no, Rich said. I can only take them at their word. Thats what this permit is for. Schiavetta asked if the applicant could possibly open a retail establishment, anyway. The application is for a commercial, not a retail, business. If they go into retail they will have violated the application and their permit. If they do that, theyll be in violation of their site plan, and will be subject to whatever powers the Town of Southold has to enforce that site plan, Rich said. Schiavetta reminded that the town is still focused on issues at Vineyard 48. This is not about Vineyard 48. This is about whats in front of us, Rich said. Vineyard 48, Schiavetta said, is an example of what can happen. Why cant we nip it in the bud preemptively? Doroski headed back to the podium to assure those fearful that there was no room for a retail space in there right now. This application is for production, it is manufacturing, he said. There is no reason to talk about what ifs when we have a very clear plan of what we want to do. Doroski added, I grew up in this town. I dont want to see it turn into a bunch of Vineyard 48s. I share the communitys concerns. We we want to raise our kids out here. This is not what we intend to do here. I dont know how much more clear we can be. Cuddy added that he had personally hung signs on Cox Road and Oregon Road announcing the hearing more than 12 days earlier. Neighbor Joanne Maguire said Oregon Road was one of the last roads in Southold Town to ride up and down, enjoying the working farms and seeing tractors. Im selfish. I dont want to see Oregon Road turn into Route 48. The last think I want to see is big, gigantic beer trucks. She asked if there was a way to prohibit trucks over a certain weight. Rich said any vehicle has a right to use a public road. This building is an approved subdivision, Rich said. I hate to be the bearer of bad news but there are probably going to be five or six such businesses, when all is said and done, he said. Thats a shame, Maguire said.",0,8,5

331,"From Congregation Sons of Israel: This morning when our staff arrived at our synagogue-Congregation Sons of Israel, Nyack, on Yom Hashoah, Holocaust Memorial Day, they were met with an incredible shock. Our Yom Hashoah display, consisting of a large banner reading Holocaust Awareness Day. Each flag represents 10,000 killed in the Holocaust was desecrated. This display which our synagogue puts up every year commemorating Yom Hashoah, was set up on Tuesday with help from our Hebrew School children who placed over 1000 flags representing the millions of Jews, Soviets, Poles, Gypsies, Disabled, Jehovahs Witnesses, and Homosexuals killed in the Holocaust. Last night CSI members had gathered as a community to commemorate Yom Hashoah by lighting memorial candles and holding a special service. Synagogue President, Sandy Abrahams said, Last night was truly lovely coming together as a community to mark this solemn occasion—to remember all those we lost in the Holocaust. To hear this morning that our memorial was desecrated and destroyed pained me greatly. To have hate on a day where we say Never again is chilling. Synagogue Leaders believe the sign was destroyed sometime between 10pm last night when our security guard left and 9am this morning when it was found. A police report was filed with the Clarkstown Police. Synagogue leadership decided to mend the sign—so our intended impact of remembering all those who were murdered by the Nazis is still seen by those driving by on North Broadway today. Rabbi Ariel Russo said, This is a startling wake up call to our community. Hateful speech on the internet and acts of vandalism in our town are not acceptable. We had a beautiful ceremony on Tuesday, where our children got emotional when discussing the Holocaust. We ended the ceremony with the hopeful words of Hatikvah, and now we have to teach them that we are not free from anti-Semitism in our own backyard. Congregation Sons of Israel (CSI) is a diverse, egalitarian Conservative Jewish community of 200 families, located in the heart of Nyack, NY along the Hudson River. As a Big Tent synagogue, it embraces the diversity of American Jewry today in all its forms. CSIs small size and location foster meaningful connections across members, generations, and the local community.  PHOTOS: BEFORE AND AFTER/Congregation Sons of Israel",1,3,2

335,"Monsignor John OKeefe, former head of Stepinac High School and the priest at St. Margaret of Antioch Church in Pearl River, faces a charge of sex abuse of a minor -- 30 years ago. Timothy Cardinal Dolan wrote the parishioners a letter Wednesday describing the allegations and explaining the process. He said the archdiocese received an allegation that on two occasions more than 30 years ago, OKeefe had abused a minor. That allegation was shared with the Rockland and Bronx county district attorneys and forwarded to the district attorney in Virginia, where one of the incidents is alleged to have taken place. Their determination was that the allegations were credible, and so the archdiocese has put its policy into effect: OKeefe may not function as a priest until the matter is resolved; the whole matter is being reviewed by professionals and the lay advisory board; and he is in a supervised setting undergoing evaluation and risk assessment, the cardinal said. OKeefe spent 25 years in Catholic education in the Bronx and White Plains before being transferred to the Pearl River church in 2003. SEE: St. Margarets OKeefe Still His Fathers Son He celebrated his 40th year in the priesthood in 2012. OKeefe has a degree from St. Johns in counseling, a degree in school administration from Fordham and a Masters Degree in Religion from the Seminary. The allegation has not been substantiated and OKeefe has denied it, the cardinal said. The protection of young people is one of our highest priorities, and the great strides made by the Catholic church throughout the country and around the world in dealing with this particular crime and sin have been noted by outside experts, Dolan wrote. He asked parishioners to keep OKeefe, the person who brought the accusation, and all those affected, particularly victims/survivors of abuse, in their prayers. He also asked anyone with concerns or suspicions about Monsignor OKeefe to reach out to Assistant District Attorney Jennifer Parietti in the Rockland County DAs office at 845-638-5001.",0,8,5
336,"Westchester County District Attorney Janet DiFiore announced today that Justin Sutton DOB (08/12/87) of 497 Liberty Street, Newburgh, New York was convicted of all four counts in the indictment charging him with:   Between September 27, 2012 and October 1, 2012, the defendant stole cash and went on a shopping spree with his victims money. He engaged in a scheme in which he repeatedly used the personal identifying information of two his victims, including their business debit ATM cards, to make unauthorized ATM withdrawals and unauthorized purchase withdrawals.  The defendants unlawful use and attempted use of stolen personal information occurred at various banks and businesses throughout Westchester County, including J.P. Morgan Chase Bank branches in the City of Peekskill and the Town of Yorktown; a Mahopac National Bank branch in the City of Yonkers; a True Religion Brand Jeans store in the City of White Plains; a Nieman Marcus store in the City of White Plains; The Loop store in the City of Yonkers; and a Wal-Mart store in the City of White Plains.  The total amount of the larceny was approximately $9,000.  His scheme first came to light when alert store employees at the Nieman Marcus store in White Plains realized the defendant was attempting to use stolen business debit cards to purchase two pairs of Prada shoes worth over $800.  Further investigation by the Westchester County Police Department, the Bedford Police Department, and the Westchester County District Attorneys Office ultimately uncovered the full extent of the defendants scheme. The defendant was arrested by the Westchester County Police.  Following his arrest, the defendant refused to be represented by an attorney and instead chose to represent himself and present his own defense at trial.  Sentencing will be on June 4th, 2014.

338,"David Buckel, a nationally known activist for gay rights and environmental preservation, doused himself with gasoline and set himself afire Saturday in a wide-open section of Prospect Park West, dying in a protest suicide to draw attention to the continued damaging of the environment. The body of Buckel, 60, was charred but still smoking when joggers and bicyclists began arriving at the park early Saturday morning. Several people later told reporters they had seen the smoke but had no idea a person was involved until after firefighters arrived to answer a call about a fire. Police said Buckel was pronounced dead at 6:30 a.m. Buckel left a handwritten note he wrote identifying himself and apparently was fully aware his death would be particularly gruesome. I am David Buckel and I just killed myself by fire as a protest suicide, read Buckels note left, with a typed letter steps from a patch of black grass that had burned beneath his body. I apologize to you for the mess. The typed letter also was sent to several news outlets, according to The New York Times, which reported the letter arrived in the papers newsroom at 5:55 Saturday morning. In his letter, Buckel laid out why he killed himself, framing his suicide as a noble sacrifice and his decision to hasten his death with the gasoline as a metaphor for the damage fossil fuels and other contaminants are inflicting on the environment. Pollution ravages our planet, oozing inhabitability via air, soil, water and weather, he wrote. Most humans on the planet now breathe air made unhealthy by fossil fuels, and many die early deaths as a result — my early death by fossil fuel reflects what we are doing to ourselves. Buckels death as an environment activist followed distinguished career as a lawyer who worked on behalf lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. His involvement with several high-profile issues and his legal maneuvering in closely watched court cases helped make him widely known as an astute political strategist, a brilliant lawyer and before long a leading voice for gay rights. He was the lead counsel in a Nebraska case he won for the the family of Brandon Teena, a transgender man raped and murdered in Nebraska and whose story would later be the basis of the 1999 film Boys Dont Cry. Buckel showed a special concern for gay youth and represented several of them in difficult cases involving such groups as the Boy Scouts of America, the U.S. military, the I.R.S. and a number of public school systems. Many people, though, would consider his key role in the Supreme Courts ruling on gay marriage to have been his most important contribution to advancing gay rights. Susan Sommer, a former attorney for Lambda Legal who is now the general counsel for the New York Mayors Office of Criminal Justice, told The New York Times Buckel was one of the architects of the freedom to marry and marriage equality movement. He deserves tremendous thanks for recognizing this was in many ways at the heart of what it meant to be gay for many Americans and making it a priority, she said. I learned so much from him about the emotional center of what it means for a gay person not to be able to have all the protections for the person they love and that its worth fighting for. Beckel handled several important gay marriage cases that ended with significant rulings that indicated increasing acceptance of gay marriage, including one in New Jersey where the states Supreme Court ruled that same-sex couples and their children were harmed because they were excluded from the rights granted via marriage. When he decided to challenge a ban on gay marriage in Iowa, his colleagues were skeptical. Hs did so anyway, and the state became one of the first in the country to permit gay marriage when the Iowa Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the ban violated the states constitution. Those victories behind him, Buckel largely left law and dove in as an energetic environmental activist. He took a job as the senior organics recovery coordinator with the NYC Compost Project, an environmental friendly program based at the Brooklyn Botanical Garden. Death, he apparently determined, was his best bet at success. A lifetime of service may best be preserved by giving a life, he wrote. Honorable purpose in life invites honorable purchase in death. I hope it is an honorable death that might serve others. Photo via Patch",0,8,5
339,"Police linked a serial offenders DNA to a 1994 rape case in Prospect Park, made famous by the New York Daily News columnist who claimed the victim made it all up. Police linked James Edward Webb, whos already behind bars for a separate sexual assault conviction, to the rape of a 27-year-old Yale Graduate inside the park after a DNA test of the victims clothes connected him to the crime, the New York Post first reported. You can imagine how emotional she was, Chief of Detective Robert Boyce said. I think my detectives cried with her. The woman was walking inside the park with groceries on April 26, 1994 when Webb raped her in broad daylight, the Post reported. The next day famed Daily News columnist Mike McAlary published a story Rape Hoax the Real Crime where he citied unnamed sources saying the woman faked the claim to promote a gay and lesbian rally. The woman, who will probably end up being arrested herself, invented the crime, they said, to promote her rally, McAlary wrote. Despite then Police Commissioner William Bratton issuing a public apology to the woman and telling reporters a test turned up evidence confirming the rape, McAlary wrote several other columns still maintaining it was a hoax, the New York Times reported. The woman eventually sued McAlary for libel and John Miller, current deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism for the NYPD, testified he was one of the sources for the columnists story. The case was eventually dismissed by a judge who ruled the victim was a public figure, the Times reported. The NYPDs Cold Case Squad recently started to look at old rape cases again about two months ago and used new technology to test the rape kit. The DNA from the 1994 were mixed up, but detectives were able to isolate the suspects and matched it to Webb. Webb was previously arrested for raping six women in the 70s and has been behind bars since 1998 for a rape case in Fort Greene, according to the Post and the Department of Corrections. Boyce told the Post that they plan to meet with the Brooklyn District Attorney about the case but new charges are unlikely to be filed against Webb because of statute of limitation laws.

340,"SOUTH SLOPE, BROOKLYN — A 55-year-old woman and longtime South Slope resident was assaulted by a stranger next to Greenwood Cemetery early Tuesday morning, police said. According to the NYPD, at 5:15 a.m. on Oct. 25, a man pushed the woman onto the sidewalk at 23rd Street and 6th Avenue, causing her to fall on her back. At that point, the man punched her repeatedly in the face with a closed fist, police said, before fleeing the scene in a car headed east on 23rd Street. The woman refused medical treatment at the scene, according to the NYPD. She described her attacker as a white man standing about five-feet-ten-inches tall, though she couldnt estimate his age. The NYPD does not currently have a description of the car he drove away in. An NYPD spokesman said that an investigation into the attack is ongoing, and that police are looking for any related surveillance footage. The incident was also reported Tuesday on a community blog, Concerned Citizens of Greenwood Heights. A post on the blog stated that the woman is a long standing resident of this block and we need to help her and her family out if we can! It asked residents to email any information about the attack to info@ccgreenwoodhts.com. And please be aware of your surroundings, the blog post continued. We have a wonderful block and community, however violence can occur anywhere. This is still NYC. Hopefully this is an (unfortunate) isolated instance. Additionally, the post stated that the suspect has a medium built & was wearing a black hoodie, and that He owns a dark colored car. However, that information was not provided to Patch by the NYPD. A friend of the victim who spoke to Patch said the attacker jumped out of his car and attacked the victim, whose face was badly bruised. The friend also said the attack didnt appear to be a robbery. The victims purse fell to the ground during the assault, the friend said, but the assailant didnt take it. The victim screamed and fought back, which brought a neighbor out of their house, the friend said, at which point the attacker fled the scene. The friend said she received this account of the incident from the victim herself. I just want women to be more aware of their surroundings, the friend said. I would hate for this to happen to somebody else She also said she hoped security cameras on a nearby electrical substation would show the attacker. Aside from the above email address, anyone with information about this attack can confidentially report it using the NYPDs Crime Stoppers website or by anonymously calling the Crime Stoppers hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477). Los hispanohablantes pueden llamar 1-888-57-PISTA (74782). Tips can also be text-messaged to the NYPD by texting 274637 (CRIMES), then entering TIP577. This attack occurred in the NYPDs 72nd Precinct, which patrols South Slope. Through Oct. 16, reports of major crimes in the 72nd were collectively up 3.7 percent compared to the same period last year, according to official police statistics. (However, Capt. Emmanuel Gonzalez, who leads the 72nd, recently told Patch that increased crime reports could be the product of better police-community relations, rather than more crime.) A total of 195 felony assaults were reported in the precinct through Oct. 16, compared to 180 during the same period in 2015.

341,"PARK SLOPE, BROOKLYN — Police have released the photos of three men allegedly connected to an attack on a transgender man on May 13. According to police, shortly after 11 a.m. that morning, a group of five men between 19 and 20 years old hurled homophobic slurs at the 33-year-old victim near the intersection of 7th Avenue and 9th Street. Three of the men, including one with a tattoo under his eye, then punched the victim, according to the NYPD, leaving him with a fractured nose and a fractured eye socket. The suspects fled in an unknown direction, according to the NYPD. The assaulted man walked to Methodist Hospital in Park Slope where he received treatment. Detectives describe the three identified suspects as black men. The first was last seen wearing a gray Nike shirt with red sleeves. The second was last seen wearing a dark colored jacket and a royal blue Adidas t-shirt. The third has a bald head, and was last seen wearing a blue jean jacket and eyeglasses. The NYPDs Hate Crimes Task Force was informed of the attack, a police spokeswoman said last week.

Our neighborhood has long been known for embracing the diversity that makes Brooklyn such a vibrant place to live, the statement read, and we will not take lightly any act of violence that threatens the inclusive community weve all built together. Transgender and gender non-conforming people, particularly transgender women of color, experience extremely high rates of violence and homicide in this country, the statement continued. We must stand up against this kind of hatred and accept everyone for who they are. We will not rest until all New Yorkers feel safe on our streets.

342,"PARK SLOPE, BROOKLYN — A 33-year-old transgender man was left bloodied and shaken last Friday the 13th by a combination racist and homophobic attack — in broad daylight — in one of Brooklyns wealthiest and most liberal neighborhoods, a police source told Patch. The man was walking northbound on 9th Street around 11:30 a.m. Friday when he reached Park Slopes central 7th Avenue, near the local G stop, police said. It was at this intersection that five unknown individuals around 19 or 20 years old made eye contact with him and made anti-homosexual statements, according to an NYPD spokeswoman. Among the alleged slurs: What are you looking at, you white f*ggot? Three of the five young men then assaulted the victim, fracturing his face, police said. He was treated for his injuries directly after the assault at Park Slopes Methodist Hospital. His attackers, however, are still on the loose. The victim described them to cops as five 19- to 20-year-old black men. One was wearing a red sweatshirt and red sweatpants, he remembered; another, a gray sweatshirt and gray sweatpants; another, a denim jacket and a blue shirt; another, a black jacket and gray pants; and another, a blue T-shirt and a black jacket.

343,"If you were walking through Central Parks Sheep Meadow on Easter Sunday this year, you may have seen it. Maybe it gave you chills. Maybe it made you laugh. A 420-pound tombstone, erected under dark of night, bore Republican presidential candidate and real estate mogul Donald J. Trumps name and birth year, plus this epitaph: Made America Hate Again. The stone was quickly removed, but the NYPD opened an investigation to make sure Trumps life wasnt in danger, according to the New York Times. Fingerprint dusting and video footage turned up no evidence. But when Gothamist published an anonymous interview with the artist behind the installation of the headstone, police got their first clue: The article included a photo of the headstone before it was carved, sitting on the chipped tile floor of the engravers showroom. The first showroom police visited, according to the Times, was the bullseye: In the Supreme Memorials tombstone shop in South Slope, bordering Park Slope and Gowanus, officers recognized the chipped floor from the picture in the article. The store owners reportedly identified the hipster (in their words) who had ordered the stone as Brian A. Whiteley, 33 — a Brooklyn-based artist whose art explores phobia, paranormal experience, radical politics, the occult and religious phenomena, according to his website. In another anonymous interview, this one with the Times, Whiteley explained that the tombstone — which he describes as political satire and a guerrilla art piece — was intended to remind Donald what type of legacy hes leaving behind. Whiteley, whos represented by the Christopher Stout Gallery in Bushwick, has been pulling morbid stunts in Brooklyn pastures for years. Neighbors may know him as the guy who wandered around Green-Wood Cemetery dressed in a full clown suit and haunted Prospect Park in a Bigfoot costume. The local artists career in paranormal, political art must be very lucrative: Though the storeowners who made the headstone wouldnt say how much it cost, another dealer told the Times that a stone like that would run about $2,450. Police have not filed charges against Whiteley, according to the Times. Patch has reached out to both Whiteley and the NYPD for comment and will update this story when we hear back.

We are in a high state of vigilance and readiness, NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a late-morning press conference. New York City Police Department officials received news of the attacks in Belgium around 3:30 a.m., according to John J. Miller, the departments deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism. Over the next couple hours, NYPD brass reached out to other city leaders, Miller said, and started a number of wheels turning that would change the shape and picture of what we saw this morning.

Enhanced canine teams and heavy weapons teams are deployed @MetroNorth @GrandCentralNYC and @LIRR concourse of Penn Station #KeepNYSafe We literally doubled the number of officers available to us this morning in our transit system, NYC Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said at the morning presser. Bratton described his own commute from Grand Central to the Brooklyn Bridge-City Hall station in Lower Manhattan on Tuesday morning. He said he saw a large number of National Guard members and MTA officers — some with K9s — patrolling Grand Central and inspecting bags. Then, on his subway ride, Bratton said he watched four members of the NYPDs Strategic Response Group board the train with long guns, helmets, etc. That degree of coverage will continue for the foreseeable future until we get a better idea of what happened over there, Bratton said.

351,"Bob Reers stayed at the community creche in Pearl Rivers Braunsdorf Park until approximately 6:30 p.m. Sunday night, in part to work on a new security system. By 10 a.m. the next morning, the manger had been vandalized; with somebody spray painting the face of the baby Jesus figurine brown. After a third incident in four years, Reers said it may be time for solutions the committee that cares for the creche and organizes the annual Procession of Children has been avoiding. For years, people have been able to walk into the manger, but that may change. I think we might have to consider putting a Plexiglas sheet in front of it, Reers said. That would break our hearts. Through the years, children have always been able to go inside the manger. I suspect we cant have that any more. In 2009, the manger was vandalized. Reers said approximately $3,000 in damage was done. Two boys on Christmas night. They went in and trashed three or four figures, Reers said. They were apprehended. Somebody at the bar across the street saw them and they were arrested. Each boy was fined and had community service hours. In . With the incidents in the past, they have all been drinking, Reers said. This year, the portable figure used during the Procession of Children was replaced by a heavier one to stay during the holiday. It is also anchored with floor screws, so somebody wanting to take it would have to have proper tools with them. They cant just take it and run, Reers said. They would have to take 25 pounds of base if they were going to steal it and thats not easy. The damage was much more specific this time. The person or people came prepared with brown paint, used it carefully enough to only get the face and may have managed to keep their faces off the surveillance cameras inside the manger. When you look how the paint was sprayed on, its just the face, Reers said. The signs say it is under surveillance. I suspect someone went and deliberately did it. I dont think someone just happened to have brown paint. Reers said they try to stay away from calling it a hate crime, but many were upset to see the damage done to the baby Jesus figure. There was some talk of leaving the vandalized figure in place, but eventually they chose to use the portable one, which is removed at night to keep it safe. Its rally heart breaking, Reers said. We dont call it a hate crime. I know when the Menorah was damaged that time; it was called a hate crime. Its just vandalism. You feel horrible because it is the (Christmas) season. If you watch the (surveillance) video or sit and watch, you see how many people come. Its a lovely experience. Its the focus of Christmas. Reers and Pearl River native and Rockland County historian Robert Knight provided Patch with a history of the Nativity set, which was originally purchased by a group of citizens from Hearns Department Store in New York City in 1950 for $700. Over the years, it was cared for by many groups including the Christmas Committee, the Pearl River Jaycees, Order of DeMoley, a junior group of the Masonic Lodge and then a Knights of Columbus youth group out of St. Margarets Church. Reers and other members of Division 3 of the Ancient Order of Hibernians have been building the Manger for approximately 12 years. Liam Confrey rebuilt the wood manger for his Eagle Scout project in 1995. Another Eagle Scout, Edward Cardinelli, restored the original figures. The infant Jesus figure was stolen and other figures were broken in 2004, leading to the Pearl River Community Creche Committee leading fundraising efforts to pay for a replacement set. The committee is made up of Eileen Bellew, Sheila and Michael Hussey, Rita and Bob Reers, MaryAnn Shortell and Kristen Sweeney. We had a fundraiser in Pearl River with collection boxes and got $10,000 and bought a brand new set, Reers said. The set is from the people of Pearl River, which is significant. Eight years ago, they began the Procession of Children. In each case, a child who recently lost a sibling or parent puts the baby Jesus figure in place. This year, it was .

353,"The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People wants to make sure that young people can walk the streets safe from the dangers of racial profiling, even if they are in a hoodie—no matter what neighborhood they find themselves in. Local chapters of the NAACP celebrated National Hoodie Day in front of the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. statue at the Westchester County Courthouse in White Plains Tuesday to bring awareness to the deaths of Trayvon Martin and Kenneth Chamberlain Sr. Anyone who wears a hood and walks in a certain neighborhood may find themselves in jeopardy, and thats not the American way, said Lena Anderson, President of the White Plains-Greenburgh NAACP. We will not stop talking about Trayvon, we will not let Danroy Henrys death go unaccounted for, we will not let Ken Chamberlains death go unaccounted for. , 17, was killed while wearing a hoodie on Feb. 26 in a confrontation with George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer. Zimmerman, who has not been charged in the incident and says he acted in self-defense, admitted to fatally shooting the unarmed teen. The incident has become the focus of national and international attention, as some say the shooting was racially motivated. Chamberlain, 68, was shot to death by police in his apartment, at the Winbrook housing complex at 135 S. Lexington Ave., on Nov. 19 after police responded to Chamberlains medical alert device. Police said that Chamberlain threatened police with a hatchet and a knife, forcing police to Tase and use a bean bag gun on him before he was fatally shot. Chamberlains family said that police used racial slurs against Chamberlain, who told police that he was fine and didnt need help. Chamberlains family said he was unarmed when police broke into his apartment and killed him. Trayvons case, even though he was not killed by a policeman, is a reflection of the attitude that prevailed in the Kenneth Chamberlain case, said Anderson. Anderson said the main issue is the false fear of minorities and white privilege. Some people in America who dont feel they are racist have to see something called white privilege, said Anderson.Its when youre shopping in an elevator and you hold onto your purse and cringe if a black person gets on the elevator with you. It creates an unreasonable fear. Seeing a group of white teens does not elicit this same fear, so thats where the connection is—in the attitude of the people who killed them. Anderson said that the NAACP wants to see fair investigations, accountability and to keep discussing this issue to raise awareness and ultimately end racial profiling. Those of us who are more protected from racism must work alongside our neighbors who are more hurt by it, and they must be aware that were hurt by it too, said Julie Carran of White Plains, co-chair of the board of directors of the Westchester Martin Luther King, Jr. Institute for Nonviolence. Even though it took four and a half months, Carran said she was pleased that White Plains Mayor Tom Roach finally spoke out on Chamberlains death after Chamberlain supporters showed up to a White Plains Common Council meeting. I am glad that public officials are hearing our voices and responding to our voices,  said Carran. We will continue to be vigilant. Those from White Plains at the rally said they could relate to hearing about someone being singled out, because they live in a specific neighborhood. Mayo Bartlett, an attorney for the Chamberlain family, represents individuals who live in the Winbook housing complex where he says people are constantly harassed by police. Melvin Smith, who was born and raised in White Plains, said he has experienced this harassment at the Winbrook housing complex. He said he is scared for local children living in these neighborhoods, and for the next kid who reaches for his cell phone in front of a police officer. I have children and I dont want my child or anyone elses child being shot dead for being African American, Hispanic, Jewish, Italian, said Smith, who has worked for Westchester County for 12 years and has worked with the City for eight. We should be able to live our life in peace, love, joy and happiness with one another and have unity. Parents shouldnt have to worry whether or not their child is going to come home. John Reavis, president of the Port Chester NAACP, said he doesnt understand why police used such force when responding to a medical alert, and questions why police withheld the officers name who shot Chamberlain when that officer was already involved in a police brutality suit. Police have stated they are confident that investigations will showed that they acted properly. Its not logical in terms of what theyve [police] been doing, said Reavis. I believe guns should be taken away from policemen and they should go back to bully sticks. The real issue is we need to make people aware of the fact that were all human beings. When you treat one person wrong, irrespective of color, youre treating everyone else the same way.

Public safety initiatives have been enhanced and the Mangano administration is bolstering the police force with increased police patrols, 911 operators, Ambulance Medical Technicians and the formation of special units. A few months ago, Mangano and the police launched a new state-of-the-art school security program to help save countless lives in the event of an active shooter.

356,"A Missouri man is accused of communicating threats to eight Jewish Community Centers in the name of an ex-girlfriend as a way of cyberstalking. Federal authorities have arrested a disgraced former journalist who they say is responsible for at least eight threats against Jewish organizations. Juan Thompson, a former reporter for the Intercept who was fired for fabricating sources there, was arrested in St. Louis on Friday morning and charged with cyberstalking and communicating threats, according to a press release from the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York. The bomb threats werent the only thing he did to harass the woman, prosecutors allege. He also made accusations against her to her boss and reported that she possessed child porn. In addition to sending emails, he also is accused of using Twitter to claim the woman was making the JCC threats and trying to frame him, along with the racist FBI. Waves of threats against JCCs nationwide since the beginning of 2017 have also included bomb hoaxes directed at the JCCs in New Rochelle and Tarrytown. Preet Bharara, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, William F. Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and James P. ONeill, the Commissioner of the New York City Police Department, announced the unsealing of a complaint charging Thompson with cyberstalking a particular woman, by, among other things, communicating threats to Jewish Community Centers in her name. He was arrested in St. Louis, Missouri, Friday morning. Everyone deserves to be free from fear and discrimination based on religion, race, or ethnicity; that is fundamental to who we are as a nation, Bharara said in the announcement. Together with the FBI and the NYPD, we have been investigating the recent threats made on Jewish Community Centers in New York and around the country. Today, we have charged Juan Thompson with allegedly stalking a former romantic interest by, among other things, making bomb threats in her name to Jewish Community Centers and to the Anti-Defamation League. Threats of violence targeting people and places based on religion or race – whatever the motivation – are unacceptable, un-American, and criminal. We are committed to pursuing and prosecuting those who foment fear and hate through such criminal threats. Thompson was behind threats made to the Anti-Defamation Leagues Manhattan headquarters, the release said. Those threats, though, were made under a womans name as part of a sustained campaign to harass and intimidate her shortly after they ended a romantic relationship, the release said. The woman was not named by the U.S. Attorneys Office.

357,"Preet Bharara, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced yesterday that the evidence does not support pursuing federal criminal charges in connection with the fatal shooting of Danroy Henry, Jr. Henry, a student at Pace University, was shot by an off-duty police officer outside a bar brawl in Mount Pleasant. The Pleasantville Police Benevolent Association later named Aaron Hess its Officer of the Year. A grand jury did not indict Hess in February 2011. Civil lawsuits are pending.  SEE ALSO   Here is the full text of Bhararas statement: Preet Bharara, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced today that the evidence does not support pursuing federal criminal charges in connection with the fatal shooting of Danroy Henry, Jr. Mr. Henry, a student at Pace University, was killed during an encounter with police officers from the Pleasantville and Mount Pleasant Police Departments in the early morning of October 18, 2010. Federal prosecutors informed Mr. Henrys parents of this decision earlier today. Federal prosecutors thoroughly reviewed the evidence regarding the events that led to and immediately followed Mr. Henrys shooting, in order to determine whether a prosecutable violation of the federal criminal civil rights laws had occurred. To prove a violation of the federal criminal civil rights statutes, prosecutors must establish, beyond a reasonable doubt, that a law enforcement officer willfully deprived an individual of a constitutional right, meaning that the officer acted with the deliberate and specific intent to do something the law forbids. This is one of the highest standards of intent imposed by law, and is different and higher than the intent standard under the relevant state statutes. Neither accident, mistake, fear, negligence nor bad judgment is sufficient to establish a willful federal criminal civil rights violation. After conducting an exhaustive examination of all of the evidence, including consultation with experts, career federal prosecutors determined that the evidence does not establish the exacting standard of criminal intent required for a federal criminal civil rights prosecution. The evidence reveals the following: At approximately 11:30 p.m. on the night of October 17, 2010, Mr. Henry drove himself and several friends to Finnegans Grill, located in the Thornwood Shopping Center in Thornwood, New York. Shortly after 1:00 a.m., a fight broke out among several bar patrons. Mr. Henry was not involved in this altercation. As a result of the fight, however, the owner of Finnegans Grill closed the establishment for the evening, ejected all of the patrons, and called the police. Police officers from both the Mount Pleasant and Pleasantville Police Departments responded to the scene. Mr. Henry departed the bar, retrieved his car from the parking lot, and pulled into a fire lane in front of Finnegans Grill while waiting for several friends. A Mount Pleasant police officer knocked on the window of Mr. Henrys car, at which point Mr. Henry pulled out of the fire lane. The Mount Pleasant police officer shouted for Mr. Henry to stop. Mr. Henry proceeded to drive on the access road leading from the Thornwood Shopping Center. An officer with the Pleasantville Police Department stepped in front of Mr. Henrys car. Although there are inconsistencies in the witness accounts regarding the chronology of certain subsequent events, the weight of the evidence indicates that Mr. Henrys car was braking when it struck the Pleasantville officer, who wound up on the hood of the car, and that the Pleasantville officer then fired through the windshield into the car, wounding one of the passengers and killing Mr. Henry. A toxicology report from the state criminal investigation, which some parties have disputed, indicated that Mr. Henry had a blood alcohol level of .13 at the time of his death. Several considerations have persuaded federal prosecutors that they cannot prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the Pleasantville police officer intentionally violated the civil rights of Mr. Henry. First, the incident happened within a matter of seconds, without any prior interaction or relationship between the Pleasantville officer and Mr. Henry that could lead a reasonable juror to believe that the officer had a motive to violate Mr. Henrys civil rights. Second, a reasonable person considering the totality of the evidence would likely conclude that the car driven by Mr. Henry struck the officer and injured him before the officer fired his weapon. This resulted in the officer being positioned hazardously on the hood of a moving vehicle, requiring him to make a split-second decision under conditions of extreme danger, conditions under which the law generally allows latitude to a police officers judgment. Third, while portions of isolated testimony from certain of the witnesses at the scene might suggest that the Pleasantville officer acted with bad intent, there is not enough consistent, credible witness testimony to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the officer acted with the requisite willfulness to deprive Mr. Henry of his constitutional rights. Finally, although racial animus need not be shown to establish a deprivation of rights under color of law, the evidence indicated that because of the darkness, the glare of the headlights and streetlamps, and the condensation on the windows, the Pleasantville officer would in all likelihood not have been able to see who the driver was or the drivers race. The Office also examined the evidence regarding the immediate aftermath of the shooting, and the failure of the officers on the scene, which was chaotic, to administer medical care to Mr. Henry as they waited for the EMT crews they had called for to arrive. Here, too, the Office could not conclude that the failure of the officers to provide immediate medical care under the circumstances amounted to a willful federal criminal civil rights violation. The Office also considered whether there had been a criminal violation of the civil rights of Brandon Cox, who was injured by a bullet as he rode in the passenger side seat in Danroy Henrys car. This injury arose out of the same exact facts that led to Mr. Henrys shooting, and for the same reasons, the evidence does not support pursuing federal criminal charges in connection with the injury of Mr. Cox.This Office analyzed these issues under the standard applicable to criminal cases, which is proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The Office expresses no view regarding any claims made against any party under the standard applicable to civil cases, which is proof by a preponderance of the evidence. Accordingly, this Offices investigation into Mr. Henrys death has been closed. Mr. Bharara expressed his deep sympathy to the family of Mr. Henry for their tragic loss.

358,"Update, 8 p.m. on Thursday, Jan. 23. Mount Pleasant Police Chief Brian Fanelli posted $50,000 bail in federal court in White Plains Thursday afternoon after he was arrested in his Mahopac home at 11:30 a.m. for possession of child pornography, United States Attorneys Office officials said. It was there that Fanelli told investigating federal agents his personal collection of child porn originated from researching material for sexual abuse school classes that he was teaching, a 10-page United States of America v. Brian Fanelli complaint detailed. What started out as research soon turned into a recreational habit in which Fanelli used the material for personal interest, according to the complaint. Fanelli, 54, of Mahopac, is being charged with one count of possessing child pornography, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. The count also carries a maximum fine of $250,000 or twice the gross gain or loss from the offense. Fanellis trial date has been tentatively scheduled for Wednesday, Feb. 19. Magistrate Judge Lisa Margaret Smith presided over Fanellis initial appearance in the United States District Court Thursday, Jan. 23 and ordered him to home detention with electronic monitoring. He is only allowed to leave his home for work, meetings and ordeals related to his upcoming trial, medical appointments and religious events. He is also not allowed to be near school grounds, and playgrounds. Fanelli is additionally prohibited from having firearms, any type of pornography, and using the internet and a cell phone. According to the complaint, the defendant was found with multiple pieces of child pornographic images and videos in his home—ranging from electronic images downloaded from the internet to videotapes, books and magazines. Fanelli was arrested following an investigation from Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) agents, which began on Nov. 9, 2013. Police officers – and especially police executives – are understandably held to a higher standard of conduct than ordinary citizens, HSI Special Agent-in-Charge James T. Hayes, Jr. said. The defendants alleged acquisition and viewing of sexually explicit images of children irrevocably breached the trust the public had in him. The widespread exploitation of children in the United States is nothing short of an epidemic that requires the coordinated focus of law enforcement agencies, prosecutors, and the general public alike. HSI is committed to devoting the necessary resources to protect the children in our communities from those intent on victimizing them, Hayes added. From at least as early as October 2013, through in or about January 2014, Fanelli used a Peer-to-Peer File Sharing Program (P2P Network) to download more than 120 files containing images and videos believed to be child pornography and made those files available to other P2P Network users through his computers shared folder on the P2P Network program. Additionally, on three occasions, HSI agents acting in an undercover capacity and using the P2P Network, downloaded images and videos believed to contain child pornography from Fanellis computer files, according to the complaint. After obtaining a search warrant, HSI agents searched Fanellis residence Thursday and located three computers. Fanelli voluntarily told the agents that he has taught sexual abuse awareness classes to elementary and middle school-age students for more than one year, and that approximately one year ago, he began viewing child pornography from his home using the P2P Network – at first as research for the classes he was teaching, but shortly thereafter for personal interest, according to the complaint. The complaint details the graphic nature of the child pornography obtained, which included a video depicting a female who is approximately 11-13 years old exposing her breasts and vagina to a webcam. Given the allegations, this case is particularly disturbing and sad, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said. A senior law enforcement officer, sworn to uphold the law, stands accused of breaking the law. And it is the law designed to protect the youngest and most vulnerable of our population from vile exploitation, she added. Mount Pleasant Supervisor Joan Maybury was not immediately available for comment Thursday afternoon. When reached by phone today, the Mount Pleasant Police Department declined to comment. The charges contained in the Complaint are merely accusations, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty. ___ Original Post, 2:19 p.m. Mount Pleasant Police Chief Brian Fanelli was arrested Thursday morning with charges of possession of child pornography, according to ABC Eyewitness News. Fanelli was arrested in his Mahopac home and is due in Federal Court in White Plains later today, ABC Eyewitness News reported. Fanelli, a more than 30-year veteran of the department who replaced outgoing Chief Louis Alagno in November, will be prosecuted on the federal level by the Southern District of New York, PIX 11 reported.

Barrancos, 21, of Forest Hills, Bruno Camacho, 21, of Elmhurst, and Edward Evseev, 21, of Richmond Hill are accused of breaking into the Cypress Hills Cemetery the night of Aug. 14, vandalizing more than 100 headstones, along with mausoleums and monuments, said Queens District Attorney Richard Brown. The three men were arraigned Monday. They are accused of knocking over 72 headstones in the cemeterys and damaging another 72 with painted slogans including God LOL and the N word, Brown said. They also allegedly spray painted the words Ching Chong on the Gee Poy Kup Associations monument and the Sze Kong Mutual Benevolent Associations arch, along with smearing the words F--- Jackie Chan on an Asian headstone with what appeared to be human feces, Brown said. They are also accused of damaging the cemeterys Memorial Abbey Mausoleum, where 15 more vaults were either cracked or painted, three stained glass windows were broken and several statues either knocked over or broken, Brown said. In Queens County, the most culturally diverse county in the nation, crimes of hate will never be tolerated and we will do all in our power to root out those responsible for such hate and prejudice, Brown said. The men were each charged with burglary, criminal mischief, cemetery desecration, aggravated harassment and criminal trespass as hate crimes, Brown said.

376,"A man who targeted Muslims and Arabs in a firebombing campaign against five Queens buildings has been jailed for 20 years. Suraj Poonai Ray Lazier Legend, 45, of Queens Village told police his goal was to kill as many Muslims and Arabs as possible the night he sped through Jamaica tossing flaming, gasoline-filled bottles at a mosque, a Hindu place of worship, homes and a deli, said Queens District Attorney Richard Brown. The attacks happened on Jan. 1, 2012, when Legend threw the first gas-filled bottle ablaze at a Hindu place of worship on 170th Street, causing a fire on the front lawn, Brown said. Legend said in a statement to police that he disliked Muslims, Arabs and Hindus. Soon after, Legend threw more blazing bottles into a private home on 43rd Avenue and a deli at 179th Street and Hillside Avenue, Brown said. He then drove to another home on 107th Avenue and threw a flammable device through a bedroom window. Legend launched his last fire bomb at the Al Khoei Benevolent Association, a mosque located at 89-89 Van Wyck Expressway, causing fire damage to its exterior, Brown said. Hate crimes and arson are a volatile mix meant to inflict suffering and intimidation on its victims, Brown said. In this case, the targets of the defendants hate-filled arson attack ranged from private dwellings to houses of worship and endangered the lives of those within the buildings as well as the firefighters called to respond to the scene. As such the sentence imposed by the Court is more than warranted. Legend, who pleaded guilty to attempted arson as a hate crime in September, was sentenced Thursday to 20 years in prison followed by five years of post-release supervision.

The graffiti written in black spray paint outside the garage of a residential building on 23rd Street between 28th and 29th Avenues read Obama f---t and Obama d--e — same message as the ones left outside Pistilli Towers that houses the offices of Senator Michael Gianaris and Assembly Member Aravella Simotas three times last month, a spokesman for the NYPD confirmed. A report for criminal mischief regarding the graffiti was filed with the NYPD Tuesday morning. They did not provide photos of the latest incident. Deputy Inspector Peter Fortune, head of the 114th Precinct, told DNAinfo that similar graffiti were found on the same garage a few weeks ago, and that the same person is suspected to be behind eight or nine recent graffiti incidents in the area.

378,"The homeless man charged with burglarizing four houses of worship in Queens in March and April will also have to answer allegations of committing hate crimes, Queens District Attorney Richard Brown announced. Joseph Woznik, 23, allegedly stole cash, checks and other items from religious institutions located in Flushing, Woodside and Elmhurst, telling police he was driven by a hatred for God. Im mad at God. I dont like church no more, Woznik allegedly said during his arrest. I dont want to deal with religion. Im sick and tired of hearing about religion. I dont break into houses, only churches. I break in to get back at God. Between March 21 and April 10, he allegedly broke into four different houses of worship: the Bangladesh Hindu Mandir Temple, Blessed Virgin Mary Help of Christians, St. Marys Romanian Orthodox Church and St. James Episcopal Church, which was hit three times.

379,"ASTORIA, QUEENS — Two pieces of graffiti containing anti-gay slurs were discovered on Monday morning on the walls of the Astoria building that houses the offices of Assemblywoman Aravella Simotas and Senator Michael Gianaris. Both graffiti, written in blue, read Obama f----t. This is the second time in two weeks that the same phrase was found on the walls of the building located on 31-19 Newtown Ave. Councilman Costa Constantinides had filed a report with the NYPD on March 11 regarding the first incidence of anti-gay graffiti, which also consisted of the same homophobic statement. It is shameful that someone is trying to divide our diverse neighborhood through hostility and bigotry, said Sen. Michael Gianaris. We can assure our community that these hateful actions will not silence our opposition towards policies we consider un-American, and we will continue to fight for those who need our help no matter the cost. Simotas and Gianaris have voiced their staunch opposition to President Trumps policies. Along with Councilman Constantinides, the two government officials hosted a rally to support Muslim immigrants in Little Egypt and celebrate Astorias diversity following the federal ban on immigration from seven Muslim countries. Senator Gianaris recently introduced a legislation that would prohibit the Port Authority, which protects New York airports, from using any of its resources to enforce the Muslim travel ban. The Senator also introduced a legislation that would add immigration status to the list of individuals protected under the states Human Rights and Civil Right Laws. Writing hateful graffiti is a cowardly, criminal act that pollutes our neighborhood and makes people feel less safe, said Assemblywoman Aravella Simotas. I am confident that the 114 Precinct will catch the perpetrator or perpetrators, whatever their sick motivation may be. These acts of hate will neither silence nor stop Astorias elected officials from working to fight discrimination and intolerance and to protect the beautiful diversity of our neighborhood. Both government officials tweeted regarding the incident: The 114th Precinct documented the graffiti found on the building and is looking at security footage to identify the criminals responsible for both the March 11 and March 20 incidents. The graffiti is considered a hate crime and NYPDs Hate Crime Task Force is investigating. Image provided by Senator Gianariss office",1,4,2
380,"Voters will head to the polls on Election Day Tuesday to cast their votes for a new Suffolk County sheriff. Two candidates, Republican Larry Zacarese and Democrat Errol Toulon, Jr. are facing off in the race. Its the first time a new sheriff will be elected in Suffolk County in 12 years; longtime Sheriff Vincent DeMarco announced this year that he wouldnt seek a fourth term. In September, Zacarese won the GOP line on the ballot in the upcoming election for Suffolk Countys sheriffs seat after a primary; it was a surprise upset for GOP candidate State Sen. Phil Boyle. Zacarese, assistant chief of Stony Brook University Police, posted a Facebook Live video after the primary win and said, while there was still work to be done before the general election,Tonight, we celebrate a hard fought victory. . . Im forever grateful, forever indebted. Tonight, the people of Suffolk County spoke. Grassroots at its finest. The race has seen its share of dramatic twists and turns. The GOP initially chose Boyle and the Dems nominated Stuart P. Besen, an attorney from East Northport, who was called a placeholder in multiple reports. But when Zacarese took home the nomination after a resounding primary win, the Democrats then chose Toulon. Both men bring years of criminal justice experience to the proverbial table. Zacarese began his public service career as a firefighter and emergency medical technician at 17 in the Holbrook Volunteer Fire Department. He attended paramedic school and, after graduation, worked at the Jamaica Hospital Medical Center and Stony Brook University Medical Center for several years before joining the New York City Police Department.

During his assignment to the emergency service unit he worked as a canine handler and tactical paramedic for nearly 7 years before being promoted to sergeant. Thereafter, he worked as a uniformed patrol supervisor and, in his last assignment as the street narcotics enforcement unit sergeant, his bio said. Currently, Zacarese is the assistant chief of police and director of the office of emergency management at Stony Brook University. In addition, he works as a deputy chief fire instructor at the Suffolk County Fire Academy and an advanced life support paramedic for the Commack Volunteer Ambulance Corps.Zacarese also holds a Masters in public administration, inspector general, and a Bachelor of Arts in forensic psychology from the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. In addition, he holds a graduate certificate in global security and terrorism studies from Fairleigh Dickinson University, a graduate certificate in criminal justice education from the University of Virginia, and a New York State paramedic certificate from Stony Brook University. He is also a graduate of the 246th session of the FBI National Academy, and a graduate of the FBI mid-Atlantic law enforcement executive development seminar leadership-training program at Princeton University. According to his campaign website, Toulon, Jr. has 30 years of criminal justice experience, focused upon corrections intelligence and combating gang violence both inside and outside of correctional facilities. Toulon, Jr. has 22 years of experience as a uniformed Member of Service with the New York City Correction Department, where he served as a supervisor and instructor at the Correction Academy, the Firearms and Tactics Unit, Emergency Service Unit and Office of Compliance Consultants, his bio states. Next, he spent twp years as Assistant Deputy County Executive for Public Safety under former Suffolk County Executive Steve Bellone. In 2014, Toulon, Jr. was named Deputy Commissioner of Operations for the New York City Correction Department; he oversaw the applicant investigation unit, training academy, correction intelligence bureau, emergency preparedness and the policy and procedures unit, his bio states. In addition, his bio said, Toulon, Jr. is certified through the Department of Homeland Security in emergency planning, radiological emergency management, incident response to terrorist bombing, WMD threat and risk assessment and state disaster management; Toulon is certified to teach weapons of mass destruction awareness, NIMS, domestic terrorism and hate crimes, his bio said.

384,"Dobbs Ferry police are open to the possibility of recent criminal mischief on a residents vehicle having a Neo-Nazi connection. Police said a 56-year old Dobbs Ferry man came out to his Ford Fusion early Sunday, Nov. 24, only to learn its front tires had been slashed and the number 88 had been engraved on its hood, and both its side doors, like a race car. Using their own knowledge and additional research on the internet, police confirmed the number is sometimes used as code for Heil Hitler. The letter H is the eighth letter of the alphabet, so HH can sometimes stand for 88, police said. The damage to the victims vehicle is more than $500 and is a criminal mischief felony, police said. While there are no suspects at this time, the case remains open. Police said there are no other signs of the incident being a hate crime, as the victim was not of the Jewish religion or any other demographic typically discriminated on by Neo-Nazis. However, if another incident with the number 88 arrives in the area again, the Heil Hitler meaning would become more evident, police said.",1,3,2
385,"Town of Hempstead Supervisor Anthony Santino, joined by Sen. Todd Kaminsky, called on the public to help police identify whomever drew racist and anti-Semitic graffiti at Baldwin Park, which was discovered by town workers on Wednesday. At a press conference, Santino said that the town is working with the Nassau County Police Department to identify whomever drew the graffiti, and intends to prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law. Acts of hate have no place in our society, and my administration wont tolerate hate-fueled graffiti or any other inappropriate activities at town facilities, said Santino. Our government will work collaboratively with law enforcement to bring those responsible to justice. Whats more, we will prosecute the vandals who defaced town property to the fullest extent of the law. The graffiti included swastikas, a hateful term used to refer to African-Americans, as well as other offensive defacement of the equipment. The graffiti appears to have been drawn with permanent marker, and the vandalism was reported to law enforcement authorities by town staff on Wednesday. Santino and Kaminsky said that the graffiti found at Baldwin Park should be investigated as a hate crime under the states penal law, since it appears to have been motivated by bias. Whats more, the graffiti clearly targets specific groups of people because of race and religious practice. Similar acts have been pursued as aggravated harassment in the first degree under the hate crimes statute. Calling on the public for assistance, the officials asked anyone has any information relating to the vandalism to please call Nassau County Crime Stoppers at 1-800-244-TIPS. My wife was horrified when she brought our son, Rafe, to Baldwin Park and they were confronted by swastikas and other racist, anti-Semitic, and hateful graffiti, Kaminsky said. The fact that intolerant bigots would expose our children to such hatred is despicable. We must show that our love for community is stronger than hate mongers attempts to install fear where we live and play. We must stand together for love and tolerance and I look forward to continue working with the Town of Hempstead to stamp out hate. Photo: Town of Hempstead",1,3,2

393,"A standing only crowd turned out Monday night for a debate among candidates vying for a Southampton Village Trustee seat, including Valerie Smith, who has sparked a public outcry after uttering a racial slur during a call to police last summer. The debate, followed by a debate by mayoral candidates, was hosted by the Southampton Press and held at the Southampton Arts Center on Jobs Lane. Before the debates, a crowd of residents turned out with signs for a Solidarity Rally, aimed at celebrating diversity and saying no to racism. You could see from the rally how diverse and culturally-rich Southampton is, said Lisa Votino-Tarrant. Of Smith, she added, She doesnt see that and its just sad.  The debate began with candidates Smith, as well as incumbents Nancy McGann and William Hattrick, delivering opening statements; the three are candidates for two seats. Hattrick said he served on the zoning board of appeals for 15 years, was mayor for four years and also served previous terms on the village board. Im overtrained but not bored or boring, he said, Hattrick said its important to retain the villages historical character and beauty, protect the coastal environment, with traffic, parking safety and code enforcement critical concerns. Southampton Village provides nearly 30 percent of the areas Community Preservation Fund revenue but sees only about 10 percent in return, he said; that funding is needed to protect the areas water as well as deal with overdevelopment and help local families, he said.  A commitment to preservation is key, he said. The current zoning is unsustainable, Hattrick said. Preservation of our drinking water is a goal, not more condominiums. His two greatest fear, he said, are losing vehicular beach access and gentrification to the point where there are hardly any year round residents left in the village. McGann said shes worked for the Village of Southampton for years and is happy to be a park of so many projects that have taken place. Shes proud to have helped secure a grant writer to access grant funding for issues such as drainage, as well as to improvements to beautify the business district, the playground, and the dog park.  Smith, who grew up in Port Jefferson, said she traveled throughout her life to southeast Asia, Australia, Central America, and Europe, returning to Long Island and settling as a year round resident 19 years ago. She bought her home in Southampton six and a half years ago. I bought a house that was rundown and needed a lot of work. With a lot of sweat equity I was able to fix up the house. It is a diverse community and Ive had some difficulties living there, she said. She said shes running to serve the Village of Southampton and the community. A few years ago I started to notice a lot of litter, which began her ascent to candidacy, she said. Southampton Press Executive Editor Joe Shaw, who moderated the event, began the questions, including one he said had been sent in by a number of readers: Was your apology sincere? Some had referred to a video of a recent community meeting, where she did not apologize. Smith said she did not realize the residents were going to be meeting in the park when she was headed to East Hampton to see a friend. I stopped to speak to everyone. One thing I think is so important and we dont do often is that we dont communicate with each other to understand what is going on, she said. I wasnt in a place of apology at the moment. — Valerie Smith Regarding the apology at the meeting, she said, I wasnt in a place of apology at that moment. Instead, she said, she wanted to explain her position and what had happened. She added that shes lived many places and this is a very different community. After seeing friends later, and discussing the matter, she said she decided to apologize. Of course my apology is sincere. It has no bearing on if I win or lose. I made the apology because that was what I felt, Smith said. Later, while discussing how the candidates planned to reach out to all corners of the community, the discussion circled back to the recent controversy over the racial slur. I said a word, and I apologized, Smith said. I spoke a word in anger and Im sorry. Smith said she was surprised that the media did not express all shed said in her conversation for a previous interview. I think politics is very tricky and certainly, its difficult to get involved in politics, either in small towns or large government. Theres a very tight group of people and its not easy to enter. I dont really see this as politics. I see this as serving my community, she said. Candidates also discussed the village budget, the Community Preservation Fund, water quality and septic issues, the Tuckahoe Center, the need for affordable housing and to keep the business district vital; Smith again said litter needs to be addressed. After the rally and debate, Lydia Bonner, whose son was one of the young men Smith called the racial slur, told Patch, Tonight was an amazing turnout of support, showing everyone how tight-knit this community is, regardless of race and color. We are family in this village. No, we are not perfect, but what family is?  A few days earlier, Smith, who allegedly used a racial slur in a call to police and is running for Southampton Village Board apologized in a public Facebook post. After meeting with neighbors and community members this afternoon, I realized that I want to say the following: I apologize for using such a hateful word last August, though I may have been justified in my anger, I should not have used that word. I am very glad that I listened to my neighbors, I did not understand how painful this word is to hear. My apologies to all whom I offended, Valerie Smith. But the apology may not be enough to stem the tide of those vowing not to cast their votes for her at the Southampton Village election on June 16. Bonner responded to the apology. I feel its not an apology because shes says she was justified in her anger. And, that she can still try and fix what has happened but we will not vote for her and we will do our best to make sure she doesnt get voted in, Bonner said. She added, Forgiveness is a must because the Bible tells us to forgive. But we wont vote for her. Votino-Tarrant, who is white and lives on the Shinnecock Reservation, said the Solidarity Rally was organized to say hate isnt welcome here.  Last week, Smith faced her neighbors at a community meeting but, despite repeated requests from those gathered, she did not apologize at the meeting. A video posted by Bonner shows the entire meeting, held on Thursday. Smith allegedly called police about a group of black men standing in front of her Hillcrest home, drinking Hennessy, calling them a bunch of n-----s.Smith, a 27east.com post said, confirmed that she made the call and said the words, after The Southampton Press received a copy of the recording via a Freedom of Information Law request. At the community meeting this week, Smith began to discuss how shed rehabilitated the house. The problem is not the house. The problem is that she called them n------s, one woman called out. Smith said she does not like littering or people throwing cigarettes onto her property and playing loud music outside her home. I deserve peace and quiet like everybody else, she said. Community members pointed out that shes had loud construction at her home for months. Our community understands our community and thats basically something that you dont, former Southampton Village Trustee Bonnie Cannon told Smith; Smith did not know who Cannon was, initially. You need to explain to this mother why you called her son a n-----, Cannon said. Racism is the issue. She needs to apologize to the community, one resident wrote on Facebook. This is not going to go anywhere because shes not going to apologize, a frustrated neighbor said, at the community meeting. Others called out for Smith to drop out of the election. How are you going to represent us? another asked. Weve asked her several times if she would apologize and she refuses to apologize. We know what we need to do and to take those steps, Cannon said, with many agreeing that they needed to register to vote in the coming election. Of Smith, a woman wrote on Facebook, She needs to take the Peace t-shirt off. Shes brought disharmony and brought the neighborhood down. After the meeting, Cannon told Patch: It was a very productive meeting. Residents, she added, are very concerned about the recent developments in the community. Smith, she said, attended. She was given the opportunity to apologize for saying the n word. She admitted that she had said it to offend a particular person, but we know it was not just one person, toward whom she used that type of language. She refused to apologize after being told by the community that we were offended. So, now the community knows what we need to do and we are mobilizing and moving forward. Its unfortunate — but she gave us no choice. A mothers story Speaking with Patch after the meeting, Bonner explained how it feels to have her son called a n----r. I was shocked at first. My sons kept telling she was using racial slurs but I thought they were exaggerating until I saw the story, she said. As a mom our job is to protect our children, all children. Im angry but Im trying to keep from letting that emotion control my behavior. Its not easy when she says the n word to my face. However, the issue has had one positive outcome, Bonner said. Im just glad as a community no matter what color we are, this is bringing all of us together, and it shows growth. We will not let an outsider come into our community and do what shes doing. We are all family in Southampton Village, no matter what race you belong to. Smith attended the gathering and attempted to explain her stance, stating at the end of the video, to Bonner, This neighborhood isnt for me. Its clear, Smith said. Speaking to Bonner, she said she spoke to one of the young men the following evening, after the call to police. I said, If you continue this behavior, youre going to be a n----r, she said. Ive asked you to move away from my property, and he said Im sorry and we had a really good connection. It was a learning experience for him, I think, she told Bonner. And then, Smith expressed her feelings about the community. This neighborhood isnt for me. Its clear. Ive known it for a while now. I cant live here if Im treated like this. I havent done anything to warrant people throwing their garbage on my property and disrespecting the neighborhood in which I live. She said people have twisted it all around, and asked why others could say the word n----r and I cant say it? Bonner explained that the word, throughout history, has long held negative implications. You guys can have your neighborhood and live with trash and garbage. You bring down your own people by allowing this, Smith said. At the meeting, Smith also said shes been called a white b----, told to get out of the neighborhood and been harassed. After the alleged racial slur by Smith, a group of elected officials and human rights organizations also issued a statement demanding that she retract her words and apologize. Smith also used the n-word during a call with the reporter, the 27east.com post said, stating that she lives in a black neighborhood. I came here and didnt see color. She added that she is a pioneer, who transformed a rodent-infested dump and said she is the only white person who owns and lives on this street, the 27east.com post said. The story has sparked an outcry of rage and shocked disbelief on social media; the story has been picked up internationally. Deeply rooted racism has long been an issue of concern on the East End. Before a Black Lives Matter rally in July, 2016, some men and women spoke out about how racism has impacted their lives. A debate with mayoral candidates followed; a story about that debate will follow on Patch. Smith did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

394,"Fire swept through the heart of Sag Harbor Village in the icy pre-dawn hours Friday, damaging at least four shops and an iconic, historic movie theater on Main Street. Friday afternoon, firefighters continued to douse the rekindled ruins of the Sag Harbor Cinema, where all that remains is the four walls and the facade, fire officials said. Its gutted. Its basically gone, a fire department official told Patch. The roof is completely gone. You can look from the front of the building right out through the back, Sag Harbor Fire Department officials said. The fire is believed to have started on the back deck Friday morning; the fire is still under investigation by the fire marshal. Both buildings on either side of the movie theater were lost or severely damaged, as was the south side of the shopping mall, fire officials said. Flames and heavy smoke spread rapidly to at least five businesses on the street. Cars were still not allowed down Main Street in Sag Harbor Friday afternoon. According to the Sag Harbor Fire Department, the fire broke out at 6:14 a.m. near the Sag Harbor Cinema, with brutal winds and freezing temperatures posing challenges for firefighters who, covered in ice, battled the blaze. But despite the widespread devastation and damage to property, no one was injured, the Sag Harbor Fire Department said. Residents turned to social media to document the devastating scene they witnessed: I can barely hold my phone. Its 22 degrees out, wrote resident Tanya Malott, who lives close to the fire, on Facebook early Friday morning. I saw flames shooting 20 feet in the air. The streets are covered in ice. The wind is blowing hard and the entire East Hampton side of Sag Harbor is covered in smoke. This is such a tragedy for Sag Harbor. She added, I saw fireman covered in ice. The streets are covered in ice and salt. The guys who are fighting this are amazing. (See videos below). The damage was crippling, witnesses said. The roof of the historic movie theater in Sag Harbor collapsed Friday, the Sag Harbor Fire Department confirmed. Initial reports by fire department officials that the building had collapsed were unclear; officials later clarified that just the roof so far had collapsed. Firefighters on the scene said that the Compass Real Estate Agency near the Sag Harbor theater was so compromised that no firefighters could go inside. Were planning to to a surround and drown, Sag Harbor Fire officials said, meaning first responders will throw water from outside on the structure. The roofs of surrounding buildings including the real estate agency and coffee shop were also compromised, officials said. As of almost noon Friday, firefighters continued to tackle hot spots in Sag Harbor after getting the blaze under control Friday morning. According to the Sag Harbor Fire Department, We still have hot spots, but weve started to release some of the mutual aid trucks. Firefighters were still pouring water on the smoking structures, fire department officials said. The bravery of firefighters reflected the heart of Sag Harbor, which continued to shine through the smoke and destruction as a tight-knit came together in solidarity, while continuing to mourn the loss of history in the village. Local business owners banded together and vowing to rebuild, even while mourning the loss of precious, irreplaceable history. Kyle Shanahan, owner of Grindstone Coffee & Donuts on Main Street, said people immediately reached out to help one another. The community is really coming together so quickly. Weve been taking coffee and donuts to first responders since 7:30 a.m. Theres basically a buffet of goodwill in front of the municipal building. Otherwise, its extremely sad for this to happen to our town. Especially to the theater. So much history lost. Hate to see anything like this right before Christmas. Jack Tagliasacchi, who owns Il Cappuccino restaurant, was a founder of the Chamber of Commerce and sits on the planning board. This fire really destroyed the lives of a lot of people, Tagliasacchi said. While no one was injured, small businesses will be hit hard by the fire, so close to Christmas, he said. Kate Mueth reported that all the art at RJD gallery on Main Street was lost. We are all very sorry. Its really terrible, Tagliasacchi said. Tagliasacchi said he was reminded of a fire 20 years ago that broke out on Easter Sunday at the Emporium Hardware store, right near Fridays blaze, a terrible coincidence, he said. Hearts are broken, Tagliasacchi said, by the damage to the historic Sag Harbor Cinema. That can never be replaced to the way it was. For that, I feel really badly, he said. The theaters future remains uncertain, he said, and even if rebuilt, Its never going to look the same as it used to. There are things from the past that you cannot replace. In addition, he said, merchants will feel the blow of the fire. All these stores are individually owned, not big chains. This will affect their livelihood. Its really sad. And we are so proud of our village. And yet, Sag Harbors indomitable spirit remains strong, Tagliasacchi said. Sag Harbor will recuperate like it did in the past. Its the low season, he said. By the time spring comes, a lot of things are going to be restored. Thats my wish. Added Tanya Malott, A crazy sad day for Sag Harbor. Our beautiful hundred-year-old Sag Harbor cinema . . . Gone. The businesses of many of my friends ruined right before Christmas. Malott said that on a trip back into the village Friday afternoon, she saw friends who own the stores to the right of the theater, well-known business owners and one, a firefighter. Her friend, she said, was hugging his son — who was crying at the ruins before him. I wasnt even sure I could go back into town. I was afraid of what I might see. It is worse than I imagined, Malott said. A statement from representatives of Brown Harris Stevens Sag Harbor office, located on Main Street and also affected by the fire, read: We are saddened by the fire on Main Street in Sag Harbor; our thoughts and prayers go out to our neighbors, the entire community and those who love the movie theater. Although our office has been severely damaged, our agents and staff are safe. Our agents will continue to service their clients with the support of our many offices in the Hamptons. We have already identified a new space in Sag Harbor and we will remain an involved member of this community as it rebuilds. Even celebrities reacted to news of Fridays fire in Sag Harbor. Andy Cohen took to Twitter to voice his sorrow, saying: So sad waking up to the news of the fire in Sag Harbor, especially that gorgeous movie theater. Hope everybody is safe.  The community turned to social media to thank the firefighters who rushed to the scene of a the fire, braving debilitating winds and freezing temperatures. What a terrible day to fight a fire, said one woman whose husband and nephews are members of the North Sea Fire Department. Not that any day is any good. They are an amazing breed, volunteer firefighters.  A large number of fire departments and ambulances responded to the scene including Sag Harbor, East Hampton, Southampton, Hampton Bays, East Quogue, and Flanders, witnesses said.

395,"Monday marked six years since Vanessa Vascez-Corleone faced the worst nightmare a mother can ever endure, when her baby boy was murdered by her then-boyfriend. And now, six years later, Vascez-Corleone — her name at the time of the murder was Vanessa Jones — opened up for the first time about the darkest night of her life, and about her memories of the sweet baby boy shes yearned for every day since. In 2012, 22-year-old Pedro Jones, of Southampton, was sentenced to 16 years to life in prison. The Suffolk County District Attorneys office said that Jones struck 17-month-old Roy Jones III so hard in the chest that the toddler went into cardiac arrest. According to authorities, Jones said he punched the child to get him to calm down. Pedro Jones was not related to Roy Jones III, who was his then-girlfriends son. Jones was living with his then-girlfriend on the reservation in Southampton, but Jones is not a member of the Shinnecock Indian Nation. According to court documents, Jones told state troopers at the time of his arrest, I was trying to make him act like a boy instead of a little girl and admitted to hitting Roy Jones III in the past, too. While the investigation was still ongoing, Jones was initially charged with first-degree manslaughter. He was indicted by a grand jury on charges of murder and endangering the welfare of a child days later. The sentence of 16 years to life in prison that was handed down was part of a plea deal. A mother remembers Six years later, the memories for Vascez-Corleone are only a heartbeat away. On her sons tombstone, the words to the song Im Already There, by Lonestar, are engraved. I used to be at work and think of him and this song used to come on, she said.  Remembering that dark night, Vascez-Corleone said she was a single mother, working seven days a week, riding her bike from the reservation all the way to Water Mill, to and from her office. The last day of my sons life I was at work most of the day. From about 9 a.m. until 5 at night, she said. Riding my bike, I had to leave earlier and get home later. I just remember my son was asleep when I left. When I had gotten home he was awake, happy and in his pajamas. I played with him and kissed him and fed him some of the food I had brought home from work. Her refrigerator at the time was broken, so she had to go to the store regularly, Vascez-Corleone said. She said shed thought about taking her son to the store with her, but the last time shed done so, hed gotten mosquito bites — and besides, it was getting late. I decided to go and leave him with my boyfriend at the time, Pedro Jones. He wasnt his father, but we had the same last names, she said. A lot of people get the story mixed up. They thought he was his babysitter, and that wasnt the case. Jones sister also stayed with them and would babysit. The two young women were very close, Vascez-Corleone said. At that time she and I decided to walk to the store. We would only be gone, at max, for an hour, she said. Vascez-Corleone said shed learned the night before that her boyfriend had been cheating. I had told him that our relationship wasnt going to work. I didnt want to be mean and kick him out, so I said that he and his sister could stay for two more weeks, since their family was about to move into a new house around that time, she said.  The young women got ready to leave for the store, she said. The only thing Pedro said to me before I left is that he had something he wanted to talk to me about. I never found out what that was. On her way to the store, Jones called her, she said, and told her Roy was throwing up. Vascez-Corleone said she told him shed bring the toddler to the ER when she got back. He called me 10 minutes later and said he wasnt breathing. I screamed at him to call 911 and to have someone pick us up along side of the road. After that, I was on the road waiting for anybody to pass me. Finally a relative who had passed the ambulance picked me up and had Pedro in the car. The ambulance had taken the baby, she said. She was told that EMTs had been able to revive her son, she said. When she got to the hospital, she saw her baby lying on an examining table in his diaper. I lost my mind, she said. I said, What is going on? She was moved to another room, where personnel asked a series of questions, Vascez-Corleone said; she and Jones were separated, she said. A doctor began to explain that procedures and medication hadnt worked, she said. I just cut her off, Vascez-Corleone said. I said, I know youre not trying to tell me my son is dead. When she didnt respond, I just lost my mind. Engulfed in agonizing despair, Vascez-Corleone said she wasnt able to look at her baby until his funeral. Even when they told me to look at him once he was dressed I had to have my dad do it because I couldnt see him that way, she said. When I did finally look at him nothing was the same. His eyes looked glued shut. His soft cheeks did not look real, she said, because skin samples had been taken for evidence. The only thing that was normal was his lips, hands and little bold legs, she said. 6 Years Later, Keeping Memories Alive Living on without her son has been a dark road marked by tears. I try to keep his memory alive the best I can, Vascez-Corleone said. I just do whatever I can. Every year since he passed Ive given him a birthday party. I donate the money people give me to another child that is in need. One year, Vascez-Corleone donated the funds to a little girl, Dahlia, who had FACES Syndrome. And the next was for a little girl that had Type 1 diabetes. But the memories of her beautiful baby boy dance through her mind and heart every day, she said.  Everything about Roy, I hold close to my heart and try to cherish. I remember all the good times we had together. He was my little partner. We were never separate unless I had to go to work. Carrying on through the tears Despite the unimaginable pain, Vascez-Corleone knew she had to find the strength to survive. I dont know what it was, but I felt like I couldnt just give up after Roy died, she said. I still had a daughter who needed me. To add to the horror, many people tried to accuse Vascez-Corleone of having something to do with her sons death. People make up rumors saying I had something to do with it. People were just being cruel, she said. I was never even under investigation. Even nowadays when I get into arguments Im called a baby killer. While Jones defense attorney maintained that the victims mother bore some responsibility for her sons death, Judge Hames Hudson said during the sentencing that he was offended by the suggestion that anyone other than Jones was responsible, according to the district attorneys office, which added that its investigation with Child Protective Services found no evidence to support the allegation. Also, Vascez-Corleone said, 10 individuals made false statements about her; they didnt think theyd be called to testify, she said. Not only was she never under investigation, Vascez-Corleone said, I wasnt even there when this happened to Roy. She added that the rumors, which were not based in any fact, cut deep at a time when she was already broken with grief. Thats the worst thing in the world to hear, because as a parent, you already feel responsible. Still, she had to look inward to find the strength to persevere: As many hurtful things that people were saying about me, I had to prove them all wrong and show then that their opinions didnt matter. I just knew I had to live the life Roy never got to live so that he and his memory will live through me and my children. Vascez-Corleone, who visits her babys grave often, said if she could speak to her son today, shed send him a message. I would tell him that I am sorry that I couldnt be able to be there that day and protect him, and that I wish we could trade places because he deserved to live a longer life, she said. And I hope I am making him proud by keeping his memory alive. I wish Roys body could turn into a seed that I could replant in my body, so that I could give birth to him, all over again. No justice for Roy Despite his jail term, Vascez-Corleone said no amount of time would be enough for her babys killer. I dont believe justice will ever be served in this matter. This man was lucky to get a sentence of 16 to life, she said. Vascez-Corleone said her other children, a daughter, 9, and son, 3, keep her strong. When I got pregnant after Roy, it was like I knew Roy was sending me another son. Three months into the pregnancy they could tell that it was a boy, and lo and behold, it was, said Vascez-Corleone. I feel that Roy lives through me and my children, and I tell them all the time that they have to live their lives and succeed for their brother because he is not here to do it for himself. He is their guardian angel. Religion has helped Vascez-Corleone through her most painful hours. I believe in God — and I also am aware there is a devil. She added that her faith in Jesus is stronger than ever. I know he brought Roy into my life for a reason and took him home early for a reason, she said. He saved me and made me a stronger person. I have nerves of steel now — and I believe because of Roy I can accomplish anything.",0,8,5

400,"Pictured: The site of the Madine Muslim Community Center. Image via Google Maps SUNSET PARK, BROOKLYN — Two teenagers were brutally beaten outside a Sunset Park mosque early Sunday morning, but the NYPD is not treating the incident as a hate crime. On Monday, an NYPD spokeswoman provided Patch with an account of the attack based on victim testimony and an ongoing police investigation. According to police, at about 1:20 a.m. on Sunday, a 40-year-old woman was waiting in a car for her boyfriend at the northwest corner of 3rd Avenue and 53rd Street in Sunset Park, which is near the Madine Muslim Community Center. Two teenagers, aged 16 and 17, approached the vehicle and tried to enter it, the spokeswoman said. At that point, the womans boyfriend approached the vehicle and assaulted both teens. DNAinfo reported that a suspect had been identified. The news site was also told by police that the teens had been flirting with the assailants girlfriend prior to the attack. The spokeswoman told Patch that the NYPD is not treating the attack as a hate crime, adding that no arrests had been made as of Monday night. Such accounts, however, are markedly different from one provided to Buzzfeed news by Mohamed Bahe, who directs the mosque. Bahe told Buzfeed that the boys saw a suspicious car parked outside of our entrance. Their suspicion, he reportedly said, was due to past incidents of prostitution and drug use in the area. The teens approached the car, Bahe said, saw the woman inside, and they asked if she needed help. Then all of a sudden a guy comes across running from the street and punches him and knocks him down. In addition, Bahe told Buzzfeed that the attacker yelled You f*cking terrorist as he assaulted the first of the two boys, basing that on the testimony of the second victim. Buzzfeed published a surveillance video of the attack showing two boys outside the car, one on foot and one on a bike. As the biker rides away, a man approaches and punches the boy on foot, after which he kicks and punches him repeatedly in the street. At that point, the biker rides back into the camera frame, and is chased out of view by the attacker. A community group called Muslims Giving Back published photos on Facebook showing a significant amount of blood on a cars hood, as well as wounds on the face of one of the boys. 2 of our young community members and volunteers just got attacked outside our masjid after prayers, the Facebook post read. One had a concussion after the attacker repeatedly kicked him in the face. The attacker ran away after some of our members chased him. One of the victims heard the attacker shout Terrorist! while being punched to the ground. This is absolutely a HATE crime. We are urging our community, our activists, our leaders, to help us make sure the NYPD 72nd precinct files this as a hate crime and catch the perpetrator.  According to both Buzzfeed and the Sunset Park Voice, the mosque had requested additional security during Ramadan, but had not received it. The sites reported that Captain Emmanuel Gonzalez, the head of the NYPDs 72nd Precinct (which covers Sunset Park) had visited the mosque to apologize for not stationing more officers there.",0,8,5

In addition, MS13 and other profanities were found written in various colors of spray paint. The incident occurred sometime between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m. According to a statement from Superintendent Thomas Rogers, all five were students at the school. Although the investigation revealed this was not the activity of a gang or an organized hate group, we were saddened to learn that the perpetrators were instead allegedly members of our student body, Rogers said in a statement. While this weeks events conclude the investigation, they alone do not heal the wound. The actions of these few individuals cannot and will not redefine the values of this community. However, this incident serves as a reminder that the work of building a tolerant and inclusive school community is an ongoing shared process between our schools, parents and greater Syosset community. We must be vigilant to reinforce those values as adults and to pass them along to our next generation. Rogers also stated that the students will be held accountable by the school for their actions, but could not specifically say how they would be punished. Photos: NCPD",1,3,2
402,"Omar Mateen, the man police say gunned down 49 people in the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history, was born in New Hyde Park and spent several years of his childhood on Long Island. Mateen, 29, listed his birthplace as the Queens side of New Hyde Park on a change-of-name petition that was first obtained by Spencer Ackerman, a reporter for The Guardian.   Mateen lived on Land Lane in Westbury for several years before moving to Florida, according to a New York Daily News report. He attended Bowling Green Elementary School, and a former neighbor described him as very restless and a very hard child to control, the report says. A former Florida high school classmate of Mateens told Newsday that Mateen was suspended after openly celebrating the 9/11 attacks.  Mateen walked into a packed gay nightclub in Orlando at closing time early Sunday, opening fire on dozens of people and holding hostages for hours before he was killed by police.

404,"In the wake of the latest series of bomb threats made to Jewish community centers Monday — two of which were in the Hudson Valley — public and private officials have condemned the acts of hatred. Paul Warhit, president of the Westchester Jewish Council, said his organization condemns these heinous acts of anti-Semitism and hate which impact all of Westchester and especially our Jewish community. He said the WJC commends the member organizations for swiftly responding and using safety protocols established to ensure their patrons safety. The Jewish Community Center on the Hudson in Tarrytown was evacuated a little after 9 a.m. Monday. The Jewish Community Center of Mid-Westchester in New Rochelle received its bomb threat around 11 a.m. No bombs were found. This was the fifth wave of bomb threats against Jewish community centers around the country since the beginning of the year. New Yorkers were targeted also in the Presidents Day assault. There were other incidents Monday in several states around the nation, including Florida, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Warhit said the threats were taken seriously and his organization is grateful to county elected officials and law enforcement personnel for their swift attention to the matter. By working together, we will apprehend those responsible for spreading hatred across our country and county, he said. New Rochelle Mayor Noam Bramson said the incident was horrifying. But — unfortunately — not surprising, given the rise in anti-Semitic incidents nationwide, he said. We must stand together in rejecting hateful activity and speech of any kind and in affirming the right of all people in our community to live free from fear or threat, Bramson said. State Assemblywoman Amy Paulin, D-District 88, said the bomb threat at the JCC of Mid-Westchester hit home to her, because that is the center she and her family uses. Yet every act or threat of hatred hits home to someone, she said, and therefore hits home to everyone who stands for inclusion, for justice and human values. Paulin said that elected officials and community leaders must speak out so that people who deal in threats, violence and hatred understand they will never win and that humanity and decency always will. Governor Andrew Cuomo ordered an investigation into the bomb threats that happened in Staten Island, Plainview, Tarrytown and New Rochelle by ordering the State Police to work with federal and local law enforcement to investigate the threats and bring those responsible to justice. Make no mistake: These reprehensible and cowardly attacks are not limited to the Jewish community, he said. They are assaults on all New Yorkers, and I vow that we will do everything in our power to catch those responsible for this wave of hate crimes, Cuomo said. I share the pain and the outrage of so many New Yorkers who are affected directly and those who are sickened by watching these attacks unfold, he said.

407,"A Brooklyn woman was arrested and charged with assault and harassment Wednesday for allegedly bashing a Manhattan lawyer in the face with a metal make-up box and shouting White b---h, take that, police said. Crown Heights resident Amy Bell, 37, was walking along Warren Street near West Broadway just after 10:50 a.m. on May 31 when she allegedly struck a woman in the head with the box, screamed an anti-white slur and laughed in her face, authorities said. Police say Bell fled west on Warren Street, leaving the 57-year-old victim with a gash on her face. The woman, a lawyer who works on civil rights, juvenile justice and immigration issues, was treated at NYU Langone Medical Center. She was on her way back to her office when she was clobbered. The victim spoke out to The Daily News earlier this week and said she thought her attacker was dancing moments before she was brutally assaulted. I was walking down the block and I did see this woman take her arm and swing it all the way back, the victim, who asked that her identity not be revealed for fear of reprisal, told the newspaper. In my head I thought she was dancing, and to myself I said, Isnt that nice, a woman is dancing on the street. And the next thing you know, kapow! Right in the eye, cheek — I mean, the pain was excruciating. Bell was charged with assault, aggravated harassment and harassment, police said.

409,"At least eight people were killed and more injured when a truck sped down a bike path near the West Side Highway, crashing into cyclists, pedestrians and a school bus before its driver exited the vehicle waving what appeared to be a gun, sources and witnesses said. Government and law enforcement officials called the attack an act of terrorism during a briefing at NYPD headquarters. Two separate law enforcement sources identified the suspect as Sayfullo Saipov, 29. While he had a Florida drivers license that listed a Tampa address, they said that hed been living in Paterson, NJ with his wife and children. Saipov is originally from Uzbekistan and arrived in the United States in 2010, the sources told Patch. They said he left a note in Arabic pledging allegiance to ISIS. The sources say its not yet known if his affiliation with the group went beyond the note. According to the NYPD, he drove a rented pickup truck onto the bike path on West Street, a few blocks north of Chambers Street, shortly after 3 p.m. Tuesday and careened about 14 blocks down it, hitting many people. The truck crashed and the driver got out holding what appeared to be two guns, sources said. Law enforcement sources said he was yelling Allahu Akbar! — which means God is great! in Arabic. The dead consisted of five people from Argentina, one from Germany, and two Americans, authorities said. Nine people remained hospitalized in serious or critical condition, with injuries that included lost limbs and head, chest and neck wounds. Mayor Bill de Blasio called it a cowardly act of terror. It was the first deadly terrorist attack in the New York City since 9/11. The driver was shot in the abdomen by Officer Ryan Nash, a five-year veteran of the NYPD assigned to the First Precinct. Saipov made it through surgery and is in custody at Bellevue, the NYPD said. Police said that a pellet gun and paintball gun were recovered at the scene. So many police came and they didnt know what was happening. People were screaming. Females were screaming at the top of their lungs, Eugene Duffy, a chef at a waterfront restaurant, told the Associated Press. Lia Tarenzi, 62, told Patch she followed emergency vehicles to the scene of the truck crash and saw victims being treated by responders. I saw a person dead on the street under a sheet and somebody being loaded on a gurney into an ambulance, Tarenzi told Patch. Then the police moved us back. Rabbi Chaim Zaklos, 35, told Patch that he saw the wreckage of the truck. It was one of those small pick-up trucks and the front was completely smashed in, Zaklos said. It was chaotic, there was FBI, there was NYPD, there was state police and they were pushing us back. The FBI/NYPD Joint Terrorist Task Force is leading the investigation. Officials from the JTTF have reached out to their colleagues in Florida, Ohio, and New Jersey for assistance. President Donald Trump linked the attack to ISIS in a tweet, though no group had officially claimed responsibility as of Tuesday evening. We must not allow ISIS to return, or enter, our country after defeating them in the Middle East and elsewhere, his message read. The law enforcement sources said that Saipov originally settled in Stow, Ohio and had lived in Paterson, NJ and Tampa, FL. He used a Florida license to rent the truck from the Home Depot in Passaic, NJ, the sources said. On Tuesday evening, Uber confirmed that Saipov had worked as driver for the ride-share company. We are horrified by this senseless act of violence, an Uber spokesperson said in a statement. Our hearts are with the victims and their families. We have reached out to law enforcement to provide our full assistance. Saipov reportedly passed the Uber background check before beginning work as a driver. Sources with the company say that no concerning safety reports have been surfaced in a review of his driving history with Uber. Officials told Patch that FBI agents were searching his homes at 7011 San Ramon Place in Tampa and at 168 Genesee Avenue in Paterson and interviewing friends and relatives. Sources say that investigators are also examining surveillance reports from Omar Mosque on Getty Avenue in Paterson where Saipov is believed to have worshipped. The Associated Press reported in 2012 that the NYPD had ordered surveillance of the mosque. This mosque has a long history in the community and is believed to have been the subject of federal Investigations. according to a document quoted in the AP story. Federal law enforcement officials told the AP that the mosque itself was never under federal investigation and they were unaware the NYPD was monitoring it so closely. They said that Saipov had worked as a truck driver and had received tickets in Pennsylvania and Missouri. Officials say that while he appears to have entered the United States legally, and later obtained a green card. Officials are also examining phone and computer records to track his contacts. One thing that they want to determine is if he is connected to five men from Uzbekistan who were charged in Brooklyn Federal Court with providing material support to ISIS. At a press conference, Governor Andrew Cuomo said investigators believe it was a lone wolf attack and that there is no evidence to suggest a wider plot. Both he and de Blasio said they didnt expect a further attack. In addition to the eight fatalities, police said 11 people were injured. The injuries were serious but not life threatening, FDNY commissioner Daniel Nigro said at the press briefing. He said the injury count is expected to rise as people self-evacuate to hospitals in search of treatment. Of the eight killed, six were pronounced dead at the scene between Houston and Chambers streets. Two more were pronounced at an area hospital. The bike path was littered with mangled bodies, witnesses said of the horrific scene. One told the Daily News that she saw two Citi Bike riders mowed down 50 feet apart. Tom Gay, a school photographer, told the AP he was on West Street and heard a woman shouting, He has a gun! He has a gun! Gay said he saw a man in a blue track suit running on West Street holding a gun. He said there was a man chasing him. He heard five or six shots, and the man in the tracksuit fell to the ground, gun still held up in the air, he said. The other man kicked the gun out of his hand. Mayor de Blasio immediately ordered a beefed-up NYPD presence in the city. Watch: Several Dead After Vehicle Crashes Into Bicyclists In Manhattan Police Commissioner James ONeill declined to confirm the name of the suspect, but said he was 29. He said the driver went from Houston Street until he crashed into a school bus on Chambers Street. Two adults and two children were hurt in the bus, he said. The driver then ran from the bus holding the two weapons. Students at the nearby Stuyvesant high school and PS 234 Independence School remained inside on lockdown while officers swarmed the scene. The lockdown was lifted within two hours, ONeill said. Rachel Elderfield, 43, waited outside PS 234 to pick up her 6-year-old son, she told Patch. She recalled hearing what sounded like five quick gunshots as she arrived at the elementary school around 3:15 p.m. I was afraid that he had sports and they were all outside, Elderfield told Patch. When Elderfield arrived at PS 234 the school principal told parents that the children were safe inside, but could not leave the building until the scene was declared safe. A roughly two-mile stretch of highway in lower Manhattan was shut down for the investigation. Authorities also converged on a New Jersey apartment building and a van in a parking lot at a New Jersey Home Depot. The attack came just hours before the massive Greenwich Village Halloween Parade, which was expected to bring thousands of people to Sixth Avenue. The event went ahead as planned.

410,"Police still dont know who threatened a Manhattan mosque with an August massacre, according to authorities. A letter sent to the Masjid Manhattan in June said the atrocity would be carried out at the Lower Manhattan place of worship sometime this month. The message, which was mailed in London, read: We will be coming to your mosque in August to carry out a massacre. It will be on a scale never seen before. The NYPD launched an immediate investigation after the letter was received on June 21, but no arrests have yet been made, an NYPD spokesman told Patch on Monday. The NYPD did not immediately respond to questions about whether the mosque, located at 30 Cliff St., is receiving additional security this month or whether investigators believe the threat to be credible. (For more information on this and other neighborhood stories, subscribe to Patch to receive daily newsletters and breaking news alerts.) Have you been a victim to or have witnessed a bias incident? Tell your story here. The letter was addressed to a 40-year-old official at the mosque who then reported it to police. Masjid Manhattan did not respond to emails from Patch seeking comment. The threat comes amid increased anxiety among Muslims and other minority groups in the U.S. during a reported rise in hate incidents. On Saturday, a bomb detonated at a mosque in Bloomington, Minnesota, an incident that the states governor is calling an act of terrorism. No one was injured in the early-morning explosion, and authorities are still investigating the early-morning explosion. The number of anti-Muslim assaults sharply increased in 2015, the latest year for which FBI data is available. A Pew Research Center analysis of the data found that assaults against Muslims in 2015 reached their highest levels since 2001. A later report from the Muslim civil rights organization Council on American-Islamic Relation indicates that the troubling trend continued in 2016; CAIRs study concluded that found that reports of anti-Muslim incidents increased 57 percent in 2016, compared to the previous year. Initial reports and data indicate that hate crimes and bias incidents against multiple minority communities, including Muslims, have increased in the wake of the 2016 presidential election. The NYPD says that reports of hate crimes, particularly anti-Semitic incidents, have increased notably so far this year. Masjid Manhattan, which was founded in 1970, originally operated out of a location on Warren Street before moving to its Cliff Street location in 2010.

411,"A letter sent to a Manhattan mosque has threatened a massacre on a scale never seen before, police said The Masjid Manhattan, located at 30 Cliff St. in Lower Manhattan, received the letter Wednesday and alerted police. It was mailed in London and read: We will be coming to your mosque in August to carry out a massacre. It will be on a scale never seen before. The NYPD launched an immediate investigation. An NYPD spokesman was not immediately able to say if extra security had been added at the mosque. The threat was first reported by the New York Daily News. The letter was addressed to a 40-year-old official at the mosque who opened it about 1:15 p.m. Wednesday, police said. A harassment complaint has been filed with the NYPD. A representative for the mosque did not immediately want to comment on the threats. On Monday, a 47-year-old man drove his van into a crowd of Muslims in London, killing one man and injuring 11 more. Darren Osborne, the man arrested in connection with the attack, shouted I want to kill all Muslims as he plowed the van into the crowd of worshippers, according to witnesses. Osborne has been arrested on terrorism charges. There is no immediate indication that Wednesdays threat against the Manhattan mosque is connected to the London attack. A group of local politicians who represent Lower Manhattan condemned the attack in a joint statement on Thursday afternoon. State Senator Daniel Squadron, Congressman Jerrold Nadler, Manhattan borough president Gale Brewer, Assembly Member Yuh-Line Niou, and Council Member Margaret Chin spoke out against the threat. Threatening a massacre at a house of worship is fundamentally an attack on the values and core principles of our nation, our city, and our borough, they said in the statement. A political climate that fosters hatred and fear continues to have very real consequences in our neighborhoods. We stand united with the Muslim community and all New Yorkers in denouncing this threat, and the hateful rhetoric that creates this climate.

413,"The National September 11 Memorial & Museum at the World Trade Center has finally been able to add five missing portraits of people who died on Sept. 11, 2001. This was largely thanks to what Jan Ramirez, senior vice president of collections and chief curator at the Memorial and Museum, calls a small, wonderful miracle. It started when Katherine Lotspeich, deputy chief at the Verification Division of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, a part of the Department of Homeland Security, saw a New York Times article about how the museum was still missing seven portraits for its gallery of the 2,983 victims of the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, and Feb. 26, 1993. She told her boss, Tammy M. Meckley, and they quickly realized from the descriptions that many of the missing people were likely immigrants who had filed for citizenship or naturalization whose files they might have. Unbeknownst to us, Ramirez tells Patch, they decided to try their very best to locate the A files— which stand for Alien files. Their search took them to this cave right in the middle of the U.S., in Missouri — an underground limestone cavern at Lees Summit that serves as a storage facility for the countrys largest collection of inactive immigrant records. There, researchers found A files for five people who were killed at their jobs at the World Trade Center on 9/11. According to the New York Times, they were: Gregorio Manuel Chavez, from the Dominican Republic, who worked at the Windows on the World restaurant and became a permanent resident in 1999; Kerene Emeline Gordon of Jamaica, who worked for Forte Food Service in Cantor Fitzgeralds cafeteria and became a citizen in 2000; Michael William Lomax of Britain, an executive at Aon who had been a permanent resident since 1996; and Ching Ping Tung from Hong Kong, an employee of First Commercial Bank and a citizen since 1996. Incredibly and happily, says Ramirez, not only did they include up-to-date information, and not only were there portraits, but there were handsome portraits — and all of a sudden the missing puzzle pieces were there. It was so beautiful to be able to retire five of the swamp oak leaves that the museum had been using to represent the missing portraits, says Ramirez. (Swamp oaks are the trees that were also chosen to be planted outside the memorial). After the found portraits were installed on Dec. 29, only five oak leaves remained in the gallery. Three represent victims whose next of kin did not want their portraits exhibited; the reasons include religious reasons or privacy concerns, says Ramirez. The last two represent the final portraits that have yet to be located: Antonio Dorsey Pratt and Albert Ogletree, both American-born men who worked in the food services industry at the Cantor Fitzgerald offices in the north tower. We know very little about them, says Ramirez. All of our efforts [since the Memorial Museum was founded in 2006] have gotten us no further. But were still hoping [...] Our goal was and still remains to have every person featured. Image via National September 11 Memorial & Museum.",0,8,5
414,"The NYPD is trying to identify a man who has placed stickers with hateful statements and symbols on Upper East Side businesses, police said. The man is wanted for committing a pattern of aggravated harassment as a hate crime for placing the stickers containing anti-gay, anti-black and anti-Semitic statements on three Madison Avenue stores since October, police said. The first act of vandalism was noticed on Oct. 4. An employee of a jewelry store on Madison Avenue between East 75th and 76th streets noticed stickers with the hateful messages on a store window, police said. On Oct. 30 an employee of a clothing store on Madison Avenue between East 77th Street and 78th streets found a sticker with an anti-Semitic symbol placed on the store window. The most recent vandalism occurred Dec. 2 at another jewelry store on Madison Avenue between East 75th and 76th streets, police said. A sticker with an anti-Semitic symbol was placed on the window.

416,"A Hunter College professor who was kicked off a plane when his husband accosted Ivanka Trump was sent two letters containing anti-gay statements and a mysterious substance at his Upper East Side office, police told Patch. Matthew Lasner, a professor of urban affairs and planning, told police that the threatening letters were delivered Wednesday to his office on Park Avenue and East 68th Street, police said. One of the letters contained a white powder, deemed safe by Hazmat and sent to the lab for more testing, and the other letter contained anti-gay threats, police told Patch. The New York Post reported that one of the letters also contained traces of feces and that the statements included threats such as Next time you and your f*g husband die, but police did not confirm those details with Patch. Lasner did not immediately respond to a message left by Patch. Lasner was escorted off a JetBlue flight at JFK because of his husbands angry reaction after finding out Ivanka Trump and her family were on their flight to San Francisco (flying in what appears to be coach seating). Lasner, also the author of Affordable Housing in New York, documented the conflict in a now-deleted series of tweets, at one point using #banalityofevil to describe the Trump-Kushner clan. Witnesses from the plane offered conflicting accounts of what actually happened. One person told TMZ that Lasners husband said, Your father is ruining the country, and asked out loud: Why is she on our flight? She should be flying private. The report, in TMZ fashion, painted a dramatic account with an unruly passenger going on a tirade. Another one of the planes passengers (sitting a row in front of Trump) described that the encounter was being sensationalized in a Facebook post. The passenger said that Lasners husband did not yell, but he was also not what I would describe as calm. Following Lasners dispute with Trump, self-proclaimed Right Wing Millennials created a petition calling on Hunter College to fire Lasner. As of this writing more than 61,000 people have signed the petition.

In light of recent vandalism, the NYPD has assigned patrol resources to maintain a post in the vicinity of the Columbus Statue, NYPD spokeswoman Kellyann Ort told Patch in a statement. The monument, which stands more than 70-feet-tall at the center of Columbus Circle, was vandalized in September when a 39-year-old homless man named Daniel Kimery painted pink nail polish on the statues left hand. Kimery was charged with criminal mischief, making graffiti and possession of graffiti instruments, police said.

The statue is located within the park near the 65th Street Transverse and Center Drive. A push to remove the statue of Columbus recently gained traction when de Blasio announced the creation of a city commission to study New York Citys symbols of hate. City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito said that Columbus is a controversial figure who represents oppression and hate to indigenous people and people from the Caribbean.

The Church of St. Paul & St. Andrew, located at 263 W. 86th Street near West End Avenue, was hit by vandals Wednesday night, police told Patch. A swastika was drawn with a black felt-tipped pen on a wall of the church near its south entrance, an NYPD spokesman said.

Daquan King, a Bronx resident, has been charged with second-degree murder, police told Patch. Zabar was found dead Wednesday, Jan. 4 in his apartment at 155 W. 81 St., between Columbus and Amsterdam avenues, police said. Authorities were at the apartment for a call of an aided male. Police said that Zabar showed no signs of trauma but the cause of death has since been ruled strangulation, police told Patch.

426,"An elderly man riding a northbound 1 train discovered homophobic and racist slurs written on the walls and the door of the subway car Saturday evening, according to the New York City Police Department (NYPD). The man reported the offensive graffiti to the trains conductor, and the NYPD got involved shortly after, police said. Swastikas were found drawn in black marker, police said, along the following statements: White Power, Finally we have a white man in the White House, White women deserve breast cancer, Homosexuality is a white mans disease, Pray that Obamas daughter gets raped and Pray that Michelle Obama gets cancer. The trains conductor discovered the graffiti when he searched the train at the 59th Street-Columbus Circle subway station, police said. The train had previously been stationed at a maintenance yard at 240th Street in the Bronx. The NYPD has yet to make any arrests in connection to the incident. On Nov. 15, the citys five district attorneys, one from each borough, released a joint statement on the rise in hate crimes in New York City and the nation after the Nov. 8 presidential election. The DAs said they would vigorously prosecute hate crimes in the city. Their statement came on the heels of numerous hate crimes reported around the city, including one of a Trump supporter punching a woman in the face after a political argument; a swastika painted in a Jewish section of Crown Heights; and a man attacked in the Bronx for wearing a Make America Great Again hat. New York State Gov. Andrew Cuomo has since set up a hotline to report hate crimes in the city. New Yorkers can call 1-888-392-3644 to make a report. Photo by Patch",1,3,2

On Saturday a man, 29, was stabbed twice during a fight with another man who shouted anti-gay slurs at him. At around 7:05 p.m. as the northbound 2 train pulled into the 110th Street station, the attacker exited the train only to return and punch the victim in the face, police said. The two men then got into a fight on the subway platform, where the victim was stabbed once in the chest, police said. After the initial stabbing, the victim caught up with the attacker on the street where he was stabbed again, police told Patch. The attacker, who was wearing blue jeans, a white T-shirt and a gray backpack, was then able to flee in the direction of West 109th Street, police told Patch.

According to police, the 52-year-old homeowner found two swastikas carved into the sidewalk in front of her home on Brent Drive. Police are treating the investigation as a bias incident. It is the second time in a week that a swastika was found on the sidewalk of a home in the area. Last week, a swastika and lewd images were found spray painted on the fence and sidewalk of a home in Oceanside. Town of Hempstead Councilwoman Erin King Sweeney and Councilman Dennis Dunne released a joint statement decrying the vandalism. Hempstead Town is a community of religious diversity and tolerance. We are greatly disturbed by tonights discovery of a swastika on a Wantagh sidewalk, the two wrote in their statement. What is even more troubling is that this discovery comes less than a week after a swastika was found spray painted on a sidewalk in Oceanside. Our township is home to those who endured the horror of Nazi death camps and many who fought the atrocities of the Nazi regime. There is no place in our communities for this symbol of hatred and intolerance.

430,"NYPD officers in uptown Manhattan will be the first in the city to start wearing body cameras when theyre introduced this month. The machines, designed to record interactions between officers and civilians, were agreed upon during negotiations between the mayor and the NYPD earlier this year. Community Board 12, which covers Washington Heights and Inwood, passed a resolution to introduce them in January. DNAinfo reported that they were to go into use in the NYPDs 34th precinct, which includes the neighborhoods, this month. The resolution states camera footage would be released within 24 to 48 hours of a serious injury or death of a civilian or police officer, unless it would compromise the ongoing investigation. The footage from body cameras can also be used for NYPDs training purposes. We operate under the illusion that reality enters our brain through our senses unfiltered. But at any given moment, our race, gender, age, profession, politics, religion and countless other identity-defining characteristics and affiliations are coloring what we see, says Drexel University law professor Adam Benforado, who is cited in the resolution passed by the community board. The body cameras are intended to provide an objective view of the events surrounding alleged police misconduct. Photo via Patch archive",0,8,5

A vandal spray painted the words ISIS and FTW — shorthand slang meaning for the win — on the wall of the northbound platform of the A train station on Dyckman Street and Broadway, police told Patch. An MTA supervisor noticed the graffiti Monday around 4:30 p.m. and notified the police of its existence, an NYPD spokesman told Patch. Next to the ISIS graffiti an Egyptian eye symbol and five unreadable phrases were also pray painted on the wall, police said. The NYPD is investigating the incident and have not made any arrests or named a suspect, police said. The ISIS graffiti marks the second time this month that the Dyckman Street A train station has been vandalized with hate speech. In early January an Inwood resident spotted four swastikas scrawled on an advertisement in the station for the Jewish Museum. I was surprised, upset, and especially angry. Ive lived in this neighborhood for close to 4 years and I have never seen anything anti-semitic here, Inwood resident Gaby Kogut told Patch at the time. I hear that other people have, but I have not.

The neighborhood resident, Gaby Kogut, first saw the graffiti at 7:30 p.m. Monday as she got off the train. Kogut — who grew up Jewish — told Patch that seeing the anti-Semitic images so close to her home stung. Kogut returned to the station around 9 p.m. to take photos of the swastika graffiti in order to report it. I was surprised, upset, and especially angry. Ive lived in this neighborhood for close to 4 years and I have never seen anything anti-semitic here, Kogut told Patch. I hear that other people have, but I have not. I love this neighborhood and have always felt welcome and accepted. Kogut also posted the pictures on her personal Facebook page and the Facebook group Inwood Community Group. I wont tolerate it in 2017 and in such a loving, accepting neighborhood as Inwood, Kogut told Patch. I felt a strong conviction that something needed to be done and that other people should be informed and involved. Many members of the Facebook group commented on Koguts post to express their shock and disappointment that the hateful imagery was found in their neighborhood. Absolutely disgusted to see this in our neighborhood. I believe there are cameras on the platform so hopefully that can be used to identify the idiot that did this, wrote a commenter named Arvind Singh. This is just disgusting. How dare them do something like this, Fernando Paulino wrote on Facebook. This isnt that type of area where you wouldnt normally find something like that. City Councilman Ydanis Rodriguez and new State Assembly Member Carmen de La Rosa — who both represent Inwood — denounced the anti-Semitic graffiti in a joint statement. This hate crime is unacceptable—not only in our community but across our city, state and country. The past election has brought hatred and intolerance back into the light and we must combat it any time it rears its ugly head. We will not tolerate hate crimes in upper Manhattan. The diverse peoples of Washington Heights, Inwood and Marble Hill stand united against hate in all its forms and we as their representatives stand committed to supporting all efforts to catch those responsible for this act.

The complaint was filed by 34-year-old Joaquin Orellana Castaneda, a native of Guatemala who has lived on Long Island for the past 12 years. Orellana was arrested in Central Islip by Suffolk County Police in April for a traffic violation, according to the release. He was arraigned the same day before a Suffolk County District Court judge, who set bail at $1,000 and released him into custody of the Suffolk County Sheriffs Office. Orellanas family posted bail the following day, but the sheriff failed to release Orellana, who had been informed that he would be released when bail was posted and he was held by the sheriff after ICE agents requested he be held for another 48 hours, according to the release. Orellana was detained at the jail before he was transferred to ICE custody, according to the release. He is currently in custody at Bergen County Jail and is scheduled to appear in immigration court on Thursday. The current political climate regarding immigration issues has created an environment where situations such as Mr. Orellanas are occurring all too often, Juan Cartagena, president and general counsel of LatinoJustice PRLDEF said.

436,"A white butcher who gave a black deliveryman a noose as a gift was sentenced to just three days of community service after pleading guilty to disorderly conduct, prosecutors said. Joseph Ottomanelli, of the historic West Village butcher shop Ottomanelli & Sons, handed Victor Sheppard the noose in April, Sheppard told police. You can put it around your neck and pull if you want to end it all, Ottomannelli told Sheppard, according to a criminal complaint. If you are feeling stressed out. I can help you with it. Ottomannelli pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct on Tuesday but will have the opportunity to get the charge erased if he completes three days of community service in a soup kitchen or food pantry and attends a restorative justice program. Ottomanellis attorney, the famous civil rights representative Ron Kuby, said the deal was evidence that both prosecutors and Ottomanellis defense team agreed that the appropriate disposition is dismissal of all charges. Kuby added Ottomanelli maintains his innocence and insists that a different employee at the meat shop handed Sheppard the noose. It was done as joke by a different employee but it wasnt funny and the employee was terminated, Kuby said. Ottomanellis has been in the Village for over a century and has zero tolerance for hate speech. Police initially arrested Ottomanelli and charged him with harassment as a hate crime, before the Manhattan district attorneys office decided to prosecute him on just one misdemeanor harassment charge. Disorderly conduct, the charge to which the butcher pleaded guilty on Tuesday, is a violation.

437,"A West Village butcher accused of handing a noose to a black delivery man will not be charged with a hate crime. Manhattans district attorney charged Joe Ottomanelli with just one misdemeanor harassment charge after he turned himself into the NYPD precinct with his lawyer Wednesday. Police had suggested he be charged with harassment as a hate crime, which carries a harsher sentence. The delivery man, Victor Sheppard, told police that Ottomanelli handed him a noose made of rope and said, Here is your gift. You can put it around your neck and pull if you want to end it all. If you are feeling stressed out. I can help you with it, according to the criminal complaint. Have you been a victim to or have witnessed a hate crime? Tell your story here. Ottomanelli then shoved the noose into Sheppards upper body, he said. Ottomanelli, who runs his familys famed West Village butcher shop Ottomanelli & Sons on Bleecker Street, was released on his own recognizance. Sheppard, 36, also told detectives that about a week earlier, the butcher told him: It wasnt so long ago that your people couldnt sit in the front of the bus. According to guidance published by New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman, the harassment charge could send Ottomanelli to jail for a year. A hate crime charge would make the harassment a felony and likely add a harsher sentence. A source close to the investigation said prosecutors believed the aggravated harassment charge was the most appropriate.

New York State Sen. Brad Hoylman and Council Member Margaret Chin passed out 400 fliers Thursday evening outside the West 4th Street subway station looking for tips about the attacker, who was still at large. Many people who were reading the flier for the first time did double takes. This is historically the place for counter-culture, said Will Maloney, 30, who lives in the Bronx. I guess maybe now there are less people dressed outlandishly and more yuppies and conservative people here, like this guy [on the flier]. Its crazy, usually this neighborhood is a pretty calm place, said Chris, a 21-year-old from Queens who was playing basketball right outside the West 4th station when a member of Hoylmans staff slipped him a flier through the fence. This guys got something on his mind, Ill say that, Chris, who wouldnt give out his last name, said. As a Hispanic male myself, its sometimes not easy for me either.

A Ku Klux Klan leader told Patch earlier in the week that members planned to attend the already scheduled Black Lives Matter rally; according to the group leader, members had attempted to attend the Westhampton Beach rallies scheduled in previous weeks but the events had been canceled twice. Earlier this week when Gary Monker, who said he is the Exalted Cyclops, or chief officer in the KKK, a violent hate group, in New York, told Patch repeatedly that Gary Monker was his name and that he lived in Center Moriches. Another media outlet and press release from the Westhampton Village Police Department, however, stated his name was Douglas Munker, of Hampton Bays. When questioned again Wednesday, he insisted again that his name was spelled Gary Munker, a different spelling than first given to Patch and other media outlets. He added, Douglas is my cousin. He is the Grand Dragon of NY. The Grand Dragon is allegedly another key position in the KKK organization. On Thursday, Vanessa Vascez-Corleone, the organizer of the Black Lives Matters rallies on the East End, said that Donna Stovall, a volunteer who has been helping to organize the events, misspoke when she told another media outlet that Vascez-Corleone had been baited to organize the rally due after reports that the KKK would be holding a rally. She said it is untrue that the Black Lives Matter rally had been planned in response to any potential KKK gathering. Vascez-Corleone said Stovall was inaccurate in saying that the event had not been previously planned and Stovall was mistaken. Vascez-Corleone organized her Westhampton Beach rally first, in response to flyers left in driveways at Westhampton Beach homes, she said. She has consistently said her rally would be held in response to those flyers. I was not baited by anyone, Vascez-Corelone said. I planned the rally first. Im coming out to prove that the KKK wont and Ill go anywhere they pass their flyers out just because I dont respect them, their beliefs, or anything they stand for. Monker told Patch Tuesday that he and members planned to attend the Westhampton Beach event Sunday; he said he and KKK members had also tried to attend previously scheduled rallies that had been postponed. When asked where, exactly, his group would be standing so that a reporter could meet him in person for an interview, Monker said that secret information could not be disclosed. On Wednesday, Westhampton Beach Village Police Chief Trevor Gonce sent out a release about Sundays rally: The Westhampton Beach Police have been in contact with the leadership of both organizations regarding the reports in the media of rallies in the Village of Westhampton Beach. Donna Stovall, the co-organizer of Black Lives Matter confirmed they will hold a rally in front of Village Hall on Sunday at noon for a peaceful gathering, as they have done within other villages, hamlets and towns of the East End. Gonce said Douglas Munker, the individual mentioned in the Patch article — the man who identified himself as Gary Monker to Patch — stated he was undecided if he will stage a rally. He will notify the police department with definitive plans prior to Sunday. The police department is continuing to work with both groups to assure that the rallies are peaceful and organized. Vascez-Corleone is the organizer of the East End Black Lives Matter rallies and, after her first event in Riverhead, vowed to plan similar events across the East End and Long Island to raise awareness and create a mess of peace and unity.",1,0,3
447,"Westhampton Beach residents got a disturbing message this weekend when they found KKK flyers distributed in their driveways. According to Westhampton Beach Village Police, officers responded to a Beach Lane residence on Sunday at 1:08 p.m. In addition, the Westhampton Beach Police Department received a second, walk-in complainant at Westhampton Beach headquarters, at 3 p.m. from another Beach Lane resident; both complaints involved receiving a flyer inside a plastic, resealable bag, found in respective driveways. The flyer depicted it was from the KKK, police said. There is no crime at this time as the incident falls under freedom of speech; however, the throwing of the bags on private property can be portrayed as littering in the village code, police said. Westhampton Beach Police detectives are investigating the incidents. Police asks that anyone with more information to please contact the detectives office at 631-288-3444. The KKK flyer was also forwarded by the Westhampton Beach Police Department to Suffolk County Police Hate Crimes for intelligence gathering. Resident Alison Akant, who works as a diversity consultant, lives on Beach Lane and said her husband drove into the driveway Sunday when he noticed a little sandwich sized baggie containing colorful rocks and a flyer from the KKK. The flyer states that Black Lives Matter, Black Panthers are telling followers to kill white people and police officers in the name of justice for the killing of black individuals by police officers in the line of duty. The flyer states that the black individuals were not innocent, they were thugs breaking the law and standing up against police. The flyer also lists a North Carolina-based phone number. When called, that number connects to a recording by the KKK, urging individuals to go to the KKK website, the Loyal White Knights of the KKK. Akant said she was deeply troubled by the flyer. I had a house full of children and family members. We were all very disturbed by this; weve never seen anything like it before. The group discussed the matter and decided they wanted to be sure community leaders and police were made aware; they called the local media and the police, she said. Akant said her daughter expressed their concerns best: Im wondering whether there are any actions that the police are considering to protect the safety of community, particularly those historically targeted by a message like this, the African American community. We thought it would be terrible if members of the community didnt even know about it. Akant added, I certainly hope that the entire community will be involved in formulating a response that takes into account all the members of Westhampton, Southampton Town and wherever flyers are being posted. In recent weeks, peaceful Black Lives Matter vigils have taken place in Bridgehampton, East Hampton, and Riverhead. Lucius Ware, president of the Long Island chapter of the NAACP, said the Southampton Towns anti-bias task force has made Southampton Town Police of KKK flyers found in areas around town and police have been keeping an eye on the situation.",1,0,3
448,"Written by LANNING TALIAFERRO (Patch Staff) Monsignor John OKeefe, former head of Stepinac High School and the priest at St. Margaret of Antioch Church in Pearl River, has been accused of sex abuse of a minor -- 30 years ago. Timothy Cardinal Dolan wrote the parishioners a letter Wednesday describing the charges and explaining the process. He said the archdiocese received an allegation that on two occasions more than 30 years ago, OKeefe had abused a minor. That allegation was shared with the Rockland and Bronx county district attorneys and forwarded to the district attorney in Virginia, where one of the incidents is alleged to have taken place. Their determination was that the allegations were credible, and so the archdiocese has put its policy into effect. OKeefe, 70, may not function as a priest until the matter is resolved; the whole matter is being reviewed by professionals and the lay advisory board; and he is in a supervised setting undergoing evaluation and risk assessment, the cardinal said. OKeefe spent 25 years in Catholic education in the Bronx and White Plains before being transferred to the Pearl River church in 2003. He celebrated his 40th year in the priesthood in 2012. OKeefe has a degree from St. Johns in counseling, a degree in school administration from Fordham and a Masters Degree in Religion from the Seminary. The allegation has not been substantiated and OKeefe has denied it, the cardinal said. The protection of young people is one of our highest priorities, and the great strides made by the Catholic church throughout the country and around the world in dealing with this particular crime and sin have been noted by outside experts, Dolan wrote. He asked parishioners to keep OKeefe, the person who brought the accusation, and all those affected, particularly victims/survivors of abuse, in their prayers. He also asked anyone with concerns or suspicions about Monsignor OKeefe to reach out to Assistant District Attorney Jennifer Parietti in the Rockland County DAs office at 845-638-5001.",0,8,5
449,"Westchester County District Attorney Janet DiFiore announced today that Justin Sutton DOB (08/12/87) of 497 Liberty Street, Newburgh, New York was convicted of all four counts in the indictment charging him with:   Between September 27, 2012 and October 1, 2012, the defendant stole cash and went on a shopping spree with his victims money. He engaged in a scheme in which he repeatedly used the personal identifying information of two his victims, including their business debit ATM cards, to make unauthorized ATM withdrawals and unauthorized purchase withdrawals.  The defendants unlawful use and attempted use of stolen personal information occurred at various banks and businesses throughout Westchester County, including J.P. Morgan Chase Bank branches in the City of Peekskill and the Town of Yorktown; a Mahopac National Bank branch in the City of Yonkers; a True Religion Brand Jeans store in the City of White Plains; a Nieman Marcus store in the City of White Plains; The Loop store in the City of Yonkers; and a Wal-Mart store in the City of White Plains.  The total amount of the larceny was approximately $9,000.  His scheme first came to light when alert store employees at the Nieman Marcus store in White Plains realized the defendant was attempting to use stolen business debit cards to purchase two pairs of Prada shoes worth over $800.  Further investigation by the Westchester County Police Department, the Bedford Police Department, and the Westchester County District Attorneys Office ultimately uncovered the full extent of the defendants scheme. The defendant was arrested by the Westchester County Police.  Following his arrest, the defendant refused to be represented by an attorney and instead chose to represent himself and present his own defense at trial.  Sentencing will be on June 4th, 2014.  He faces a maximum sentence of fourteen years in state prison.  Assistant District Attorney Brian Fitzgerald of the Economic Crimes Bureau is prosecuting the case.",0,8,5
450,"A federal judge has ruled that a lawsuit filed by the family of Kenneth Chamberlain Sr., a White Plains Man who was shot dead by police in November of 2011, can move forward. LoHud reported earlier this week that U.S. District Judge Cathy Seibel have the go ahead to most of the familys claims against the City of White Plains,  Police Officer Anthony Carelli, Sgt. Stephen Fottrell and Sgt. Keith Martin. Among the claims that Seibel did dismiss was the familys wrongful death claim. Plaintiffs wrongful death claim fails as a matter of law, Seibel wrote in her ruling. The Amended Complaint contains no allegations that Chamberlain leaves behind any distributees who have suffered a pecuniary loss by reason of his death. Plaintiff argues that the Amended Complaint mentions Chamberlains two children…which by itself is not sufficient. Seibel also dismissed claims made by the family against the White Plains Housing Authority and the other police officers involved in the incident, including Stephen Hart, who was fired from the White Plains police department earlier this year, according to news reports. These Defendants actions do not constitute assaults or batteries under New York law, Seibel wrote in her ruling. None of these actions caused a reasonable apprehension of bodily injury that is sufficiently imminent to constitute an assault, and none of them proximately caused any contact with Chamberlains person, defeating Plaintiffs battery claims. Nor do they amount to a breach of duty proximately causing Chamberlains injuries. The tort claims therefore fail as a matter of law, also resulting in the failure of the conscious pain and suffering and wrongful death claims. Accordingly, the state tort claims are dismissed in their entirety against Defendants Hart, Love, Demchuk, Markowski, and Spencer. Seibel also threw out a conspiracy claim made by the family. Chamberlain, a 68-year-old former U.S. Marine and corrections officer, was killed after White Plains police entered his apartment inside the Winbrook Housing complex, located at 135 S. Lexington Ave. in White Plains. Police arrived at Chamberlains apartment after his Life Aid device was accidentally activated and he failed to respond to the Life Aid operator. Police initially responded to the scene with firefighters and emergency personnel. A history check showed that there were earlier calls for an emotionally disturbed person at Chamberlains apartment. Police allegedly knocked on Chamberlains door and requested to come inside. Chamberlain told the officers that he did not place the phone call and he declined to let them in. Police continued to the knock on the door and the Life Aid operator, through the use of a two-way, told Chamberlain that the officers would leave after they checked on his safety. Police, who had a master key to all of the apartments in Winbrook, finally opened the door, but could not open it all the way due to safety lock that was still in place. When police removed the apartment door, they said Chamberlain came at them with a knife. He was hit with a stun gun, beanbags and, finally, two rounds from a handgun. Last year, a grand jury found that there was no reasonable cause to pursue criminal charges against the police  reasonable cause to vote for an indictment in the in the killing of Kenneth Chamberlain Sr. The familys lawyers have said the police department and housing authority failed to protect the constitutional rights of Chamberlain and other minority groups living at the Winbrook Housing complex by allowing three members of the departments community policing unit—who were all involved in separate pending lawsuits that alleged police brutality and racism—to continue to work in the neighborhood. The familys lawyers have also said that police actions directly lead to Chamberlains death, since police escalated the situation by calling him a racial slur and forcing their way into his apartment. The remaining parties in the suit are scheduled to appear before Seibel Friday.",0,8,5

Cops got a call about an individual with a black helmet distributing these flyers while riding a motorcycle near 82 Lee Ave. around 9:30 p.m. Thursday, a police spokesman told Patch. What we have is a complaint of aggravated harassment, in connection with flyers that have a swastika or swastikas or some type of racial depiction on them, the NYPD spokesman said.

Anti-Semitic is the most right now with a 123 percent increase, NYPD Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce said at a press conference earlier this month. The swastikas are particularly problematic for us because sometimes theyre in transit, theyre in buildings, Boyce said. We dont always have video. Its a difficult case to prosecute — to investigate and prosecute. So thats how were doing it, increasing our investigative powers to get it done.

455,"SOUTH WILLIAMSBURG, BROOKLYN — Two members of a local Orthodox Jewish group that volunteers to patrol the neighborhood will serve no time in prison for brutally beating a young, gay black man as he walked down Flushing Avenue in the heavily Orthodox part of South Williamsburg. Pinchas Braver, 22, and Abraham Winkler, 42, were instead sentenced this week — as part of a reported guilty plea deal — to three years of probation and 150 hours of community service (each). They must also pay their victim — Taj Patterson, now 25 — $1,400 in restitution costs. Patterson was walking down Flushing Avenue around 5 a.m. on Dec. 1, 2013 when he was attacked by a gang of traditionally dressed Jewish men, including Braver and Winkler, who beat him to a pulp while shouting homophobic slurs, according to news reports at the time. Pattersons eye socket was reportedly broken and his retina torn during the attack — leaving him blind in one eye. The New York Post reported that during court deliberations, his convicted attackers have resisted searching outside their insular Hasidic circle for a spot to serve the 150 community-service hours. From the Post: Braver and Winkler, pictured below, are scheduled to be back in court Oct. 18, at which time their community-service assignment will be finalized. This isnt the first time members of an Orthodox Jewish neighborhood patrol, also known as the Shomrim, have been accused of discrimination by non-Jewish Brooklynites living near Orthodox neighborhoods. A recent Daily Beast investigation into these vigilante Hasidic groups profiled David Flores, a Sunset Park resident who was, like Patterson, beaten bloody while traveling through the Borough Park neighborhood, another Hasidic stronghold in South Brooklyn. Because Flores fought back by firing his gun, hes now spending 12 years in upstate prison. Patterson, for his part, is now suing the city and the NYPD for giving his attackers favorable and preferential treatment after he was beaten. The NYPD investigation into Pattersons case was reportedly botched from the start. According to the New York Daily News, records show NYPD officers with the 90th Precinct, covering South Williamsburg, closed a probe into the bloody beating within 24 hours — even scrawling across the case file, final, no arrests, CLOSED. Earlier this year, the U.S. Attorney for Manhattan, Preet Bharara, accused various NYPD officers, including the former head of the NYPD precinct in Sunset Park (which neighbors Borough Park), of essentially letting the nearby Orthodox Jewish community police itself, in return for lavish vacations and prostitutes on airplanes and the like. Pattersons lawyer, Andrew Stoll, sees a connection there. The Patterson case demonstrates a disturbing disparity in access to justice between Taj Pattersons community and the Orthodox community, which flows directly from the NYPDs high-ranking collusion with the vigilante Shomrim patrols, Stoll said in a recent interview.",1,0,0
456,"WILLIAMSBURG, BROOKLYN — Two members of the orthodox Jewish community, including one from Brooklyn, drowned Tuesday morning while swimming off a Florida beach, according to reports. The Orthodox news website Vos Iz Neias reported that Yitzchak Rosenberg, the owner of the Certified Lumber Corporation in Williamsburg, and diamond dealer Chaim Parnes drowned while swimming off of Haulover Beach near Miami. Rosenberg lived in Brooklyn, while Parnes was from the New York town of Kiryas Joel.  The deaths were also reported by the local ABC News affiliate in Florida, though the station did not name the deceased. A woman answering the phone at Certified Lumber on Tuesday said the company had no comment to offer about Mr. Rosenberg. A spokeswoman for the Miami-Dade Police Department confirmed that two individuals had died, but would not provide further information on their identity or the cause of death. Erika Benitez, a spokeswoman for Miami-Dade Fire Rescue, would not confirm the deaths, as a matter of department policy. However, Benitez confirmed that two individuals were pulled from the water by rescuers shortly after 11 a.m., while two others escaped it on their own power. CPR was administered to those who had been rescued, and both were transported to an area hospital, she said. A fifth individual with the group was also taken to the hospital later with symptoms possibly related to the stress of the incident, she said. Benitez said that the victims had been swimming in an unguarded section of the beach that was marked as off-limits to bathers, adding that strong currents had been observed in the ocean. According to Vos Iz News, Rosenberg and Parnes were grabbed by a riptide. The men who were in the water but survived, Aron Wurzberger and Yitzchok Englander, were also from Kiryas Joel. Rosenberg was reportedly a member of the Satmar religious community. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Satmar community in New York after the terrible tragedy in Miami. Last November in North Miami, gunmen robbed Parnes of $35,000 worth of diamonds, according to a local NBC report. Parnes told the station that he feared for his life during the hold-up, adding that a gun was put to his head. If (you) take away life, (it) doesnt come back, he said. So Im thankful for God. Todays Thanksgiving. Im giving up big time for God. [Editors note: an earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Chaim Parnes was from Brooklyn.]",0,8,5

He praised Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly for his exceptional deployment efforts. Hynes also pointed to the more than one dozen programs his office initiated, including his re-entry program, ComAlert which helps the formerly incarcerated reconnect with society. A regular program of gun buy-backs, youth outreach by assistant district attorneys and influential community members and programs that are directed toward getting at-risk youth and gang members back on track are also part of the solution to keeping the murder rate at extraordinary low levels, Hynes said.

According to an unnamed city official, 133,934 people were stopped by police between April 1 and June 30, compared to 203,500 from January 1 to March 31. The Post says that part of the reason for the decrease was Police Commissioner Ray Kellys pledge to institute additional oversight, training and outreach to prevent racial profiling. Thats part of the reason it went down, but not the biggest reason, the source told the paper. According to the source, rookie cops assigned to high-crime areas were responsible for the majority of the stop-and-frisks, and during a crime spike earlier this year, the NYPD put about 1,000 recent police academy graduates on that beat. The stops dropped quickly by April, when the paper says the rookie complement was back to normal. Additionally, some cops were wrongly classifying legitimate arrests as stop-and-frisks by filling out 250s, the forms used to document each stop. If a cop observes someone doing something suspicious and has probable cause to go over and makes an arrest, he doesnt have to fill out a 250, the source told the paper.",0,8,5

467,"A 37-year-old man from Charlotte was convicted by a jury in Akron, Ohio for attempting to recruit members for ISIS and trying to build a sleeper cell of terrorists in the U.S., , according to the Department of Justice. Erick Jamal Hendricks represents the significant online ISIS threat that we face daily – a U.S. citizen that becomes radicalized online and attempts to recruit and train individuals to commit jihad, all while on American soil, Special Agent in Charge of the Cleveland FBI Office Stephen D. Anthony said. Hendricks will be sentenced at a later date. Court documents show that Hendricks tried to recruit and train people for ISIS, mostly via social media. He was eventually caught by law enforcement using undercover agents, traditional investigation and because one of his recruits, Amir Al-Ghazi, was caught and arrested in June 2015. Al-Ghazi at the time was attempting to buy an AK-47 assault rifle and ammunition. He didnt know he was trying to buy the weapon from an undercover police officer. He has already pleaded guilty to helping a designated terrorist organization and is awaiting sentencing.Al-Ghazi had pledged allegiance to ISIS on social media and had expressed interest in attacking the United States, prompting law enforcement to track him. It turns out, Al-Ghazi was recruited by Hendricks. Hendricks reached out to Al-Ghazi on social media in the spring of 2015. He told Al-Ghazi he needed people and wanted to meet him in person. Hendricks went on to say that he had already recruited several brothers, located in Texas and Mexico, and he wanted to get everyone together, for training, according to court documents and trial testimony. While recruiting him, Hendricks would test Al-Ghazis religious knowledge and his commitment, asking him about his willingness to commit jihad and die as a martyr. He wanted to know how much Al-Ghazi wanted to enter jannah (paradise). Al-Ghazi thought this meant Hendricks was recruiting people to commit terrorist attacks, the Department of Justice said. In fact, Al-Ghazi also believed that some of Hendricks brothers may have been responsible for a thwarted terrorist attack in Garland, Texas on May 3, 2015.An undercover FBI agent also spoke with Hendricks on social media. Hendricks told the agent, on April 16, 2015, that he should download a document called GPS for the Ghuraba in the U.S. The document included a section called Final Advice which said that brothers and sisters should not allow themselves to go to jail. It went on to encourage Muslims to die as a Shaheed (martyr) and to boobie trap their homes. Recruits were told never leave home without an AK-47 or M16. Hendricks complained about having to sift through recruits everyday, telling the undercover agent that Allah chooses only the few and Everyday I do this day in and day out, according to court document and trial testimony. When talking to another person, Hendricks said he wanted to create a sleeper cell that would be trained and housed in a secure compound and would conduct attacks throughout the United States. He specifically mentioned wanting to target military members whose information had been released by ISIS and a woman who organized the Draw Prophet Mohammad contest.Hendricks said he had 10 people already signed up for his sleeper cell, court document and trial testimony revealed. Then, in April 23, 2015, the 37-year-old Hendricks reached out to Elton Sampson on social media. Sampson and Nadir Hamid Soofi attacked the First Annual Muhammad Art Exhibit Contest in Garland, Texas. The two opened fire, wounding a security guard. Police soon arrived on the scene and shot and killed both Sampson and Soofi. Hendricks also spoke to the undercover FBI agent about the exhibit contest in Garland. He told the agent to go to the event and If you see that pig (meaning the organizer of the contest) make your voice heard against her. This defendant recruited and directed people here in the United States to launch attacks against our citizens, and attempted to recruit others to engage in similar attacks, U.S. Attorney Justin Herdman said. Protecting our citizens from terrorist attacks remains our priority and our community will be safer with this defendant behind bars. FBI offices across the U.S. coordinated in the investigation, including offices in Cleveland, Columbia, South Carolina, Baltimore and Charlotte, North Carolina.

470,"Update: Durham city officials have said no permit has been granted to any group by police for a rally.- In the wake of Charlottesville violence this week, law enforcement in Durham, N.C. is bracing for a possible Ku Klux Klan rally Friday. The news of the possible white supremacist rally comes just days after protesters toppled a statue of a Civil War soldier outside the Durham County Courthouse and a statue of Robert E. Lee was found vandalized outside a chapel on the campus of Duke University. The Sheriffs Office is thorough researching the potential of several groups with opposing viewpoints holding demonstrations in Durham, spokesperson Tamara Gibbs said Friday morning. This is partly why the Sheriffs Office continues to remind demonstrators to first obtain a permit and most importantly, abide by the law. I expect demonstrators to conduct themselves in such a manner that is legal and respectful of the Durham County community. While news spread of the possibility white supremacists would be marching in Durham, some businesses decided to close early over growing anxieties, The Herald Sun reported. (Get Patch real-time email alerts for the latest news in Charlotte — or other neighborhoods. And iPhone users: Check out Patchs new app.) Community fears of white supremacist and Klan rallies are spreading nationwide, prompting the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups in the U.S., to say that in the wake of the violence in Charlottesville, states should amend their open-carry laws. Nothing in the Second Amendment gives anyone the right to carry a gun whenever and wherever one may choose, said SPLC President Richard Cohen in a commentary. Lower courts have ruled that sensitive places include national parks, university football games, post offices, vehicles and aircrafts. If a university football game or a national park can be considered to be sensitive places where guns have no place, surely public assemblies, particularly those that might trigger strong emotions, are as well. By Thursday, the Durham County Sheriff arrested eight people for their participation in destruction of the statue and said more arrests might be possible. Local protesters wanted that number to be higher, as hundreds of supporters formed a line outside the sheriffs office to turn themselves in for the crime in a show of solidarity.

471,"For two years, Matthew Fenner said he pleaded with authorities to investigate his allegations that a group of fellow congregants at the Word of Faith Fellowship church had punched, slapped and choked him to expel his homosexual demons. An Associated Press investigation found that Rutherford County investigators and then-District Attorney Brad Greenway delayed investigating and told Fenner his only option was to pursue misdemeanor charges against the church members he said assaulted him for nearly two hours in the evangelical churchs sanctuary. The APs conclusions are based on more than a dozen interviews, court documents and secretly made recordings that were provided of Fenners meetings with law enforcement authorities, including Rutherford County Sheriff Chris Francis. (For more local news, click here to sign up for real-time news alerts. If you have an iPhone, click here to get the free Patch iPhone app.) In February, the AP detailed how many Word of Faith Fellowship congregants were regularly attacked both physically and verbally in an attempt to purify sinners by beating out devils. The church has come under scrutiny by law enforcement and social services authorities on numerous occasions with little effect, mostly because followers refused to cooperate. But Fenners relentless pursuit eventually led to the indictment of five congregants, who were charged with kidnapping and assault. The whole investigation should have taken a month, said Michael Davis, who spent 15 years as a Rutherford County sheriffs investigator before retiring last year, and was not involved in the Fenner case. Greenway said he couldnt recall details of the Fenner case, but initially believed it wasnt a big deal based on what he said the sheriff told him. Francis said Greenway made the decision not to pursue charges early on. In May, longtime minister Brooke Covington became the first of the five church members to go on trial in proceedings that attracted national attention due to the APs investigation. A mistrial was declared during jury deliberations. Covington will be tried again Sept. 11. During the trial, Fenner, now 24, testified that he didnt call police the night of the Jan. 27, 2013, attack because he was afraid and was living with Covington at the time. When Fenner fled to his grandparents two days later, they called authorities. The AP found that Fenner not only told local and federal law enforcement agencies what happened to him, but also warned of larger ongoing abuse. Word of Faith Fellowship was founded in 1979 by Jane Whaley, a former math teacher, and her husband, Sam. It has grown from a handful of followers to a congregation of about 750 in North Carolina and nearly 2,000 members in churches in Brazil, Ghana and affiliations in Sweden, Scotland and other countries. Fenner initially talked to a Rutherford County sheriffs deputy the day after fleeing the church, but wasnt ready to press charges. I was still confused and hurt. I needed time to think, he told the AP. But on Jan. 31, 2013, he met with FBI agent Fred Molina, who was investigating a complaint from another congregant who said he was beaten because he was gay. Fenner detailed what happened to him, along with the abuse of other congregants, six people told the AP. When he received a letter months later saying the FBI wasnt going to investigate, he said he was told it was because the other church member had recanted. The FBI referred questions to the Charlotte office of U.S. Attorney Jill Rose, who said Fenners allegations did not meet the requirements of a federal crime. Fenner said he talked to sheriffs detective Joey Sisk about the assault on June 7, 2013, and pressed Sisk for updates for months. On an October 2013 recording obtained by the AP, Sisk said Greenway read Fenners statement and decided no criminal charges would be pursued. Sisk told Fenner that his only recourse would be trying to file misdemeanor charges with the local magistrate, which experts say rarely works. Fenner met in January 2014 with Rose, then an assistant U.S. attorney in Charlotte, hoping to get help under a federal hate crimes law. On a tape obtained by the AP, Fenner and four supporters told Rose about the abuse. Rose, who was once an assistant prosecutor in a district that included the church, told the group that she would think about her next step, but Fenner said she did not return any follow-up calls. Rose told the AP that the assault Fenner described did not fully meet the requirements of the federal hate crimes statute for sexual orientation because there was no element of interstate commerce, or movement of across state lines. Fenner had been repeatedly pressing for meetings with Greenway and Francis, the sheriff, and finally landed a meeting with Francis in August 2014. I have not looked at one thing in your case file, the sheriff said in a recording of the meeting, adding that Greenway had personally reviewed the allegations and decided not to prosecute. After camping outside his office, Fenner met with Greenway in October with five family members and friends. When the group told Greenway that both Francis and Sisk earmarked him as the one who declined to prosecute, Greenway responded that he didnt know details of the case because he hadnt seen an incident report. In an interview with the AP this February, Greenway said he could not recall much about Fenners complaint. The sheriff told me early on it was not a felony kidnapping case, he said, though Francis disputed that characterization. In the interview, Greenway called the church influential and said its accusers werent always reliable. You just got tired going against them, he said. In December 2014, a month after Greenway lost his re-election bid, a grand jury indicted the five Word of Faith members. If it wasnt for our pressure, said Fenners aunt, Lynn Rape, nothing would have happened. Photo credit: Kathy Kmonicek/Associated Press",1,4,0

474,"Police on Monday said one gunman was responsible for the Sunday shooting that left seven people dead at the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin in Oak Creek: Wade Michael Page, a 40-year-old Army veteran. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel is reporting that Page was attached to the Fort Bragg base in North Carolina. He recently moved to a duplex in the 3700 block of E. Holmes Avenue in Cudahy, the newspaper reported. Three bodies were found outside the temple at 7512 S. Howell Ave. and four were inside the building. Among the deceased is the gunman, who apparently acted alone. The two officers who first arrived at the temple exchanged fire with the gunman. One officer, a 20-year veteran of the department was shot several times, according to Greenfield Police Chief Bradley Wentlandt, who briefed members of the press shortly before 2 p.m. Sunday. He was in surgery Sunday afternoon but was expected to survive, Wentlandt said. The second officer fired back at the gunman, shooting him dead. As of the time of Wentlandts briefing, tactical units had gone through the temple and found no additional shooters. Police believe early reports of multiple shooters grew from witnesses seeing the same shooter from different angles. No further information is expected from police until a press conference at 10 a.m. Monday. Police executed a search warrant at the alleged gunmans Cudahy home, according to media reports, and several law enforcement agencies are still at the home in the 3700 block of E. Holmes Ave. The neighborhood has been evacuated, and neighbors have reported seeing police officers going in and out of the house. Oak Creek Patchs partners at Fox 6 are reporting that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) Chicago has said the gunman was a white man in his 40s. Officials have not released the name of the gunman. Agents and officers from the FBI, ATF and Cudahy Police Department surrounded a Cudahy home Sunday evening and evacuated the area. A Patch editor on the scene said it looked like members of a SWAT team were using a ladder truck from St. Francis to gain access to the second floor. Brandon Smith, a resident in the same Cudahy neighbhood told Patch that residents of that block have been evacuated and others have been asked to stay in their homes. All-in-all, people are calm. A lot of people are milling around in the neighborhood and are very calm, he said. Some are even playing hacky-sack in the street. Bomb-sniffing dogs have been on the scene and shortly before 8 p.m., it looked like law enforcement was getting ready to take some kind of action. Agents from the FBI interviewed a couple who own the home, and as the couple walked away, they stopped briefly to tell reporters that anything they had to say, they said it to the federal agents. Right around 8 p.m., officers first entered a home on the south side of the street, and then moved to another home across the street on the north side of the block Patch left a message for the FBIs public information officer, and we will update this story when we hear from him. By 9 p.m., Oak Creek police were canvassing the Gables Apartments, a complex near the two homes where the suspect is believed to have lived. At the same time, SWAT teams continued working inside the two units the suspect most recently called home. The mother of the suspected shooters landlord told Patch and that he had just broken up with his girlfriend. The Chief Medical Officer at Froedtert Hospital confirmed the hospital is treating three male victims from the shooting at the Sikh Temple in Oak Creek. The first calls came in at approximately 11:18 a.m. telling hospital personnel to prepare for multiple gunshot victims. One of the patients is the Oak Creek police officer who was hit several times. All three were reported to be in critical condition as of 4 p.m. Sunday. The victims suffered gunshot wounds to their extremities, neck and abdomen, said Dr. Lee Biblo Sunday afternoon. As for the severity of the victims injuries or who was suffering from what specific injuries, Biblo would not elaborate further. He did say the hospital is well equipped to handle this kind of trauma. We train for this, he said. Police departments and rescue assistance from throughout the region — including Wauwatosa, Fox Point, Racine and Brown Deer, as well as the Milwaukee County Sheriffs Department — responded to the scene. The Flight for Life helicopter also responded to the scene and the FBI was called in. Landlord Kurt Weins told the Journal-Sentinel he had been interviewed by law enforcement, and said he was surprised by what had happened. I had him (his tenant, believed to be the shooter) checked out and he definitely checked out, Weins told the JS. The cops told me they dont want me to say nothing right now. The JS also reported FBI Special Agent in Charge Teresa Carlson provided a short media briefing at the scene in Cudahy, saying a SWAT team and evidence response team were executing a search warrant. The JS reported that when Carlson was asked how long the search would take, she said, as long as we need. Its going to be a long night. While there has been no official release of the names of the victims, as word spreads through the Sikh community, information about the people shot is becoming public. The JS reported one of the dead was Parkash Singh, a priest at the temple. He was a good guy, a noble soul, Manminder Sethi told the JS. A retired firefighter who lives near the temple told the JS he helped someone who had been shot. The man and been shot right through the side, Jim Haase told the JS. He said he helped the man for about 10 minutes. As police cleared the temple, they brought people who had been inside to a bowling alley across the street. The American Red Cross and Salvation Army were providing assistance there. A temple leader said after the shooting started, some women hid inside a closet for more than an hour. CNN is reporting the son of the congregation president told TMJ4 that his father was shot as he tried to tackle the gunman. A hotline has been established for family members looking for information on those involved. The number is 1-888-298-1964. Oak Creek Police Chief John Edwards has said heroic actions of officers stopped it from being worse than it is. The incident is being treated as domestic terrorism, officials said at the Sunday afternoon press conference, and the FBI is overseeing the criminal investigation. The Los Angels Times is reporting that the shooting suspect had tattoos that lead them to label the incident as domestic terrorism. The papers FBI source apparently asked for anonymity because they didnt have the authority to speak to the media. The source stopped short of saying the gunman belonged to a hate group associated with violence. However, ABC News is reporting sources have told them the suspected gunman belonged to a white supremacist group. Though police have not given any details on the identity or motive of the shooter, or released the identities of the victims, sources have told ABC News the shootings are the work of a white supremacist or skinhead. - ABC News A person who had friends inside the temple told Patch the gunman opened fire during a morning service. Another member of the temple said The priest called from inside (the temple) and said, Send ambulances; send ambulances. Police did not release information about the suspect, but early police radio reports said a witness described the shooter as a white male, with a heavy build and bald head, wearing a sleeveless T-shirt and carrying two handguns. No one was in custody as of the 4 p.m. press conference. CNN is reporting police have recovered two semi-automatic handguns, information they attribute to a law enforcement source directly involved in the investigation. The White House says that President Barack Obama also has been briefed on the shootings. In a statement, Obama said: Michelle and I were deeply saddened to learn of the shooting that tragically took so many lives in Wisconsin. At this difficult time, the people of Oak Creek must know that the American people have them in our thoughts and prayers, and our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who were killed and wounded. As an apparent precaution, several squad cars were stationed at the entrances and exits of the Sikh Temple at 3675 N. Calhoun Road in Brookfield — the only other Sikh temple in the region. The president also called Gov. Scott Walker on Sunday. Walker released his own statement about the shooting: Our hearts go out to the victims and their families, as we all struggle to comprehend the evil that begets this terrible violence. At the same time, we are filled with gratitude for our first responders, who show bravery and selflessness as they put aside their own safety to protect our neighbors and friends. He and his wife, Tonette, asked people to join them in praying for the victims and their families, for the safety of law enforcement and first responders, and for strength and healing for this entire community and our state. The shootings come nearly one year after state Rep. Josh Zepnick and Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm . The temple asked for the meeting because of recent violence against Sikhs in Milwaukee, including the looting of at least one Sikh-owned business. The Sikh community is a strong and positive force within Milwaukees diverse ethnic population, Zepnick at the time. Its unacceptable that they, or any law-abiding business owner, be the target of what appears to be an escalating pattern against certain businesses and segments of the population. The Sikh Temple began with 20 families in rented space in the south side of Milwaukee and has since grown to number in the hundreds. A new Gurudwara was built in Oak Creek to better serve the needs of the growing community. The construction of the 17,500 square-foot Gurudwara was completed in 2007, with parking for 100 cars. Sikh Indians, because of religious tradition, wear turbans to cover their uncut hair and have longer beards. They are often mistaken for Muslims and have been the targets of racially-motivated crimes by anti-Muslim people and groups, as evidenced by the epithets shouted at them.

475,"The XVIII Airborne Corps announced Thursday, April 12, that Fort Bragg will serve as the venue for all courts martial trials related to investigations into the death of Pvt. Danny Chen, 19, of New York. Col. Kevin V. Arata, Chief, Public Affairs Office XVIII Airborne Corps and Fort Bragg, and Maj. Runo Richardson, U.S. Army Chief, Administrative Law Office , Staff Judge Advocate, spoke to local media today about the legal process following the outcome of the investigation. Our condolences go out to the family and friends of Pvt. Danny Chen; The loss of any soldier, and especially one of a deployed soldier is a tragic one indeed, said Col. Kevin V. Arata, in his opening statement. Arata explained why Fort Bragg was selected as the best location for the military and judicial proceedings at this time, because few other Army installations have the capacity and experience to work with this volume of cases. Fort Bragg has excellent resources to include court rooms, judges, hotels, support infrastructure and the population of 56,0000 soldiers that provide a panel of support, as well as the ability to provide both prosecuting and defense trial counsel. Its not unusual at all for a case like this to be transferred from the combat theater to the United States. Trying the cases in Afghanistan would require witnesses and the accused soldiers to stay in a combat zone for more than 365 days, as well as becoming a logistical challenge and very cost-prohibitive due to witness travel and coordination. Richardson shared that none of the cases have been referred to a courts martial and none of the accused have been arraigned, but they are in the process of gathering evidence and working to bring all the accused to Fort Bragg. After the evidence has been reviewed, the Staff Judge Advocate will make the determination as to what charges are recommended and should be referred to a court-martial which is anticipated to happen around the end of the month. The general court martial command authority, Lt. Gen. Frank G. Helmick, will make the final decision of referral of charges after he receives the Staff Judge Advocates recommendation.  If the charges are referred, the accused will be arraigned and the case will be scheduled for trial. This means that Helmick is authorized by Congress to convene a court-martial by issuing an order that charges previously initiated against an accused service member will be tried by a specified court-martial. Details about the weapon surrounding Chens suicide are under investigation and nothing further has been released. Arata said that it varies depending on the type of unit the solider is assigned to, but typically they deploy with rifles. The accused eight soldiers, listed below, were charged in December with Chens death have been removed from leadership positions according to Richardson and they are being supervised by officers and noncommissioned officers. 1st Lt. Daniel J. Schwartz, 25, of Maryland, eight counts of dereliction of duty; Staff Sgt. Blaine G. Dugas, four counts of dereliction of duty; Staff Sgt. Andrew J.

Edwards said on her Facebook page, where she shared the video of the incident. Edwards was at the pool for the Fourth of July holiday when Adam Bloom asked for her address. In the video, she can be heard recounting the confrontation to police and Bloom. First, he asked me my address, I gave it to him, she says. Then, Edwards claims, Bloom asked her for an ID to prove it matched the address she gave. When she refused, Bloom called the police, she told the television station. Where does it say that I have to show an ID to use the pool? Edwards asked. The Winston-Salem Journal reports that Bloom was the pools chairman in the homeowners association, and that both Bloom and Edwards live in the neighborhood. Bloom has since resigned from the chairman position and from the homeowners association. Police Verify Edwards Right To Swim Winston-Salem Police Chief Catrina Thompson said there was no need for Edwards to show her ID. The issue was brought up. The officers asked the questions that needed to be asked to get the issues resolved, Thompson told WXII-TV. They were able to prove that Jasmine had what she needed to get into the pool. At the end of the day, there was no need to see an ID, at that point, because there was nothing to say that an ID was necessary. We will not be used as pawns to further someones dislike for anyone, said Thompson. In the video, Edwards says no one else at the pool was asked to show an ID. I feel this is racial profiling, she says in the video. Im the only black person here, with my son in the pool, right? And, he walked only to me to ask for my ID. Bloom said in the video that he asks residents for ID a couple times a week. The video shows a police officer questioning Edwards about whether she had used a swipe card to enter the pool area. Yes ... thats how I got in, Edwards responds. If she has a card to get in the pool, I believe that that should be enough, the officer says. Bloom asked police to test her gate card. Edwards allowed police to try her card on the entrance, and the door unlocked like normal. See Jasmine Edwards Facebook page for the video. Sonoco Fires Bloom Sonoco, which employed Bloom, fired him over the racial profiling allegations, the Charlotte Observer reports.

477,"A man who plotted to shoot hundreds of people on behalf of the Islamic State group received a life sentence Tuesday in a case that prosecutors say illustrates the dangers of Americans radicalized through social media. Justin Nojan Sullivan, 21, received the sentence in federal court in Asheville after pleading guilty late last year to the foiled plot to attack a nightclub or concert and film it for distribution on terrorist sites. Sullivan was a teenager in the small foothills town of Morganton when he became radicalized in 2014 after watching terrorist beheadings and other Islamic State propaganda online, U.S. Attorney Jill Westmoreland Rose said Tuesday. (For more local news, click here to sign up for real-time news alerts. If you have an iPhone, click here to get the free Patch iPhone app.) Authorities say Sullivan admitted to having frequent contact online with a prominent Islamic State recruiter and propagandist in Syria, the now-dead Junaid Hussain. Sullivan agreed to Hussains request to make a video of his planned attack so that it could be used online for recruitment, Rose said. They know this is a way to win the hearts and minds of American youth or those who may be disenfranchised in some way, Rose told reporters after the sentencing hearing. Certainly the use of social media by foreign terrorist organizations, particularly ISIS, is one of the ways that theyre most effective. ISIS is an alternative acronym for the Islamic State group. Sullivan, who was arrested at his parents house in June 2015, planned to buy a semi-automatic rifle at a gun show to kill hundreds of people at a concert or night club near where he lived in western North Carolina, Rose said. She said he planned to use an AR-15 rifle and hollow-point ammunition because he knew that he could inflict mass casualties and mass pain. She described his plan as a murderous plot that was serious and imminent. The suspect discussed his plans on social media with an undercover FBI employee who Sullivan believed to be sympathetic to his views, and he tried to recruit the person to help. After his mother discovered a silencer that was mailed to Sullivan, he offered the undercover FBI employee money to kill her and his father so they wouldnt interfere, according to court documents. Authorities say Sullivan expressed his support for the Islamic State in front of his parents and smashed religious objects in their home. Rose said Sullivans father, a military veteran, contacted authorities, who were already monitoring the son. Sullivan also faces a state murder charge after authorities say he took a rifle from his fathers gun cabinet and killed a 74-year-old neighbor with it in December 2014. He took the mans money to use for his terror plot, according to court documents. Sullivan pleaded guilty in federal court late last year to one count of attempting to commit terrorism. Yet Sullivan told a federal judge during Tuesdays hearing that hes not a cold-blooded murderer. Asked afterward about Sullivans statement, Rose responded: I think the facts would show otherwise.

478,"Two former U.S. Postal employees, one a supervisor and the other a manager, were sentenced to prison for stealing packages containing marijuana from the U.S. mail and then selling the drugs, said U.S. Attorney Justin E. Herdman. Rabih Kairouz, 29, of Akron, was sentenced to 37 months in prison. He had been a supervisor at the Five Points station for the Postal Service in Akron. Scott Gay Jr., 33, of Canton, was sentenced to six months in prison followed by six months of house arrest. He was a manager at the Postal Services North Hill station, according to court documents. Corey Turnbull, 26, of Ravenna, was sentenced to probation. He also was a supervisor at the Five Points station in Akron. A fourth person, Anton D. Easter Jr., 27, of Akron is scheduled to be sentenced next month, for his involvement in the operation. Together, Kairouz, Gay and Turnbull intercepted suspected drug parcels at U.S. Post Offices in Akron, opened the packages, removed marijuana contained inside, sold the marijuana to Easter and shared the profits, according to court documents. This took place between February and May 2017. Kairouz also had a kilogram of methamphetamine that he stole from the mail, according to court documents. The investigation preceding the indictment was conducted by the U.S. Postal Service Office inspectors and the Akron Police Department.",0,8,5
479,"The Cleveland Police Department fared poorly in a review of its used-of-force practices and policies released Thursday by U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and the Justice Department. The report comes in the tense aftermath of several police use-of-force controversies nationwide, including Michael Browns death in Ferguson, Missouri, and locally, a Cleveland police officers deadly shooting of 12-year-old Tamir Rice in a local park Nov. 22, in which the boy was wielding a realistic-looking plastic air gun. In the press conference announcing the critical report, Holder said Thursday that comprehensive reforms are necessary, and the Justice Department is prepared to take legal action to get them, according to reporting by the Cleveland Plain Dealer (Northeast Ohio Media Group/Cleveland.com). Joined by U.S. Attorney Steven Dettelbach and Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson in the public unveiling of the report, Holder said the civil-rights investigation examined nearly 600 use-of-force incidents between 2010 and 2013, in addition to hundreds of interviews and thousands of documents. Serious problems uncovered in the investigation, according to the Northeast Ohio Media Groups report, include a lack of accountability, insufficient training, policies that dont work, and not enough engagement with the community. These issues were listed and explained in a 58-page letter submitted to Mayor Jackson. In the coming months, Dettelbach said at the press conference, the Justice Department will work with Cleveland city and police officials, while also participating in community forums, to put substantial policy reforms into effect. Eventually, he said, a court-appointed, independent monitor will oversee a consent degree laying out the mandated reforms. Findings in the DOJ report, which can be found here, include: • The Cleveland Police have engaged in a pattern of excessive force that violates the constitutional rights of citizens. • Officers have been too quick to pull their firearms, which has escalated situations, or have fired them when not necessary by the circumstances at hand (an allegation leveled in the recent Tamir Rice shooting). • Police officers have Tasered or punched suspects already in handcuffs or otherwise in police control. • The Police Department has been lax in investigating or disciplining officers suspected in the use of excessive force. The Justice Department launched its civil-rights investigation of Cleveland in March 2013 at the request of Mayor Jackson, U.S. Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-Cleveland, and other community and religious leaders. It was sparked by a November 2012 police chase in which the two unarmed individuals being chased died in a barrage of 137 police bullets. The report, according to the Northeast Ohio Media Group report, does acknowledge challenges faced by police officers in Cleveland, and stresses that the majority of the departments officers behave correctly and competently, and dont violate anyones constitutional rights.",0,8,5
480,"A race-discrimination lawsuit is being filed against Bahama Breeze in Orange Village. The lawsuit claims that two white managers filed a false police report and acted with hostility toward a group of black customers. Dining while black is not a crime, but Bahama Breeze treated these educated, professional African-Americans like common criminals—calling the police and humiliating Danielle Nelson and her guests for no good reason, said the plaintiffs attorney Subodh Chandra. Such discrimination has no place in our society. Our clients intend to hold those responsible accountable for this mistreatment and hope to propel the national conversation about the role of race in American life. A spokesperson for Bahama Breeze emailed Patch a statement, saying, Everyone is welcome in our restaurants, and we strive to provide an exceptional experience for all our guests. The manager involved no longer works for us because they mistreated a guest, which is inconsistent with our values. The lawsuit stems from a June 19 incident, where Nelson, an author, was celebrating a book deal and a pending move. She reportedly arranged to reserve an enclosed patio for her guests. Once she and her friends arrived, things apparently turned ugly, the lawsuit indicates. According to the lawsuit, Nelsons party was treated poorly from the moment of their arrival. Once the group was seated, one manager allegedly said that, You and your people cannot leave out of this room for anything. Things reportedly escalated when one of the guests had to leave to go to work. Staff repeatedly refused to give the woman her check, but finally relented after some argument. After the guest left, one of the Bahama Breeze managers called the police and filed what the lawsuit says is a false report. In the report, the guests reportedly complained that their bills were taking too long to be delivered and then were threatening to walk out without paying. The reporting officer said the women paid their bills and showed their receipts to police, and asked about filing a complaint against the manager. Seven years ago, in 2009, this same Bahama Breeze was the subject of a racial harassment lawsuit from the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The company agreed to pay $1.26 million in relief in a settlement of that suit — which alleged that 37 black workers had been harassed while working for the restaurant.

481,"A teenager was arrested by Israeli police on Thursday in connection with a series of threats made to Jewish Community Centers across the US. It is yet unclear how many of the threats made in recent months may be connected to this suspect. The Jewish Federation of Cleveland issued a statement on the suspects arrest, saying, We are grateful to the FBI, and all other authorities locally, nationally, and internationally who played a role in apprehending this subject. Thank you for protecting and defending our Jewish community and the many community members from diverse faiths and cultures who use our institutions. No group of people should be a target of hate, from within or outside of their community, for any reason. We stand against hate and for unity. Over Presidents Day weekend, the Mandel Community Center was one of 10 Jewish Community Centers across the nation to receive bomb threats. Police quickly searched the facility and deemed the threat non-credible. To read more about the wave of Presidents Day threats that swept the nation, click here. JCCs in North America have received more than a 100 threats since January. Attorney General Jeff Sessions confirmed the arrest of the suspect in a statement, saying the arrest was the culmination of a large-scale investigation spanning multiple continents for hate crimes against Jewish communities across the country. The Department of Justice is committed to protecting the civil rights of all Americans, and we will not tolerate the targeting of any community in this country on the basis of their religious beliefs. I commend the FBI and Israeli National Police for their outstanding work on this case, Sessions said. This is the second arrest in connection with the threats made to JCCs across North America.

486,"An Akron jury has convicted a 37-year-old North Carolina man for trying to build a sleeper cell of terrorists in the U.S. Erick Jamal Hendricks, originally from Charlotte, tried to recruit people to perform terrorist acts for ISIS, according to the Department of Justice. He will be sentenced at a later date. Erick Jamal Hendricks represents the significant online ISIS threat that we face daily – a U.S. citizen that becomes radicalized online and attempts to recruit and train individuals to commit jihad, all while on American soil, Special Agent in Charge of the Cleveland FBI Office Stephen D. Anthony said. Court documents show that Hendricks tried to recruit and train people for ISIS, mostly via social media. He was eventually caught by law enforcement using undercover agents, traditional investigation and because one of his recruits, Amir Al-Ghazi, was caught and arrested in June 2015. Al-Ghazi at the time was attempting to buy an AK-47 assault rifle and ammunition. He didnt know he was trying to buy the weapon from an undercover police officer. He has already pleaded guilty to helping a designated terrorist organization and is awaiting sentencing. Al-Ghazi had pledged allegiance to ISIS on social media and had expressed interest in attacking the United States, prompting law enforcement to track him. It turns out, Al-Ghazi was recruited by Hendricks. Hendricks reached out to Al-Ghazi on social media in the spring of 2015. He told Al-Ghazi he needed people and wanted to meet him in person. Hendricks went on to say that he had already recruited several brothers, located in Texas and Mexico, and he wanted to get everyone together, for training, according to court documents and trial testimony. While recruiting him, Hendricks would test Al-Ghazis religious knowledge and his commitment, asking him about his willingness to commit jihad and die as a martyr. He wanted to know how much Al-Ghazi wanted to enter jannah (paradise). Al-Ghazi thought this meant Hendricks was recruiting people to commit terrorist attacks, the Department of Justice said. In fact, Al-Ghazi also believed that some of Hendricks brothers may have been responsible for a thwarted terrorist attack in Garland, Texas on May 3, 2015. An undercover FBI agent also spoke with Hendricks on social media. Hendricks told the agent, on April 16, 2015, that he should download a document called GPS for the Ghuraba in the U.S. The document included a section called Final Advice which said that brothers and sisters should not allow themselves to go to jail. It went on to encourage Muslims to die as a Shaheed (martyr) and to boobie trap their homes. Recruits were told never leave home without an AK-47 or M16. Hendricks complained about having to sift through recruits everyday, telling the undercover agent that Allah chooses only the few and Everyday I do this day in and day out, according to court document and trial testimony. When talking to another person, Hendricks said he wanted to create a sleeper cell that would be trained and housed in a secure compound and would conduct attacks throughout the United States. He specifically mentioned wanting to target military members whose information had been released by ISIS and a woman who organized the Draw Prophet Mohammad contest. Hendricks said he had 10 people already signed up for his sleeper cell, court document and trial testimony revealed. Then, in April 23, 2015, the 37-year-old Hendricks reached out to Elton Sampson on social media. Sampson and Nadir Hamid Soofi attacked the First Annual Muhammad Art Exhibit Contest in Garland, Texas. The two opened fire, wounding a security guard. Police soon arrived on the scene and shot and killed both Sampson and Soofi. Hendricks also spoke to the undercover FBI agent about the exhibit contest in Garland. He told the agent to go to the event and If you see that pig (meaning the organizer of the contest) make your voice heard against her. This defendant recruited and directed people here in the United States to launch attacks against our citizens, and attempted to recruit others to engage in similar attacks, U.S. Attorney Justin Herdman said. Protecting our citizens from terrorist attacks remains our priority and our community will be safer with this defendant behind bars.

487,"The stories of abuse are numerous. The culprit is not unique, though. Homeschooling laws can make it easy for abusers to torture children under their care. Sixteen-year-old Natalie Finn died from starvation on Oct. 24, 2016, after her mother locked her, a 15-year-old brother and a 14-year-old sister in their bedroom for months, food and water all but cut off. One of the kids who survived, barely, later said their bedroom slowly filled with their own waste because their mother often would not let them out even to use the bathroom. When they did get permission, they were so desperately thirsty they sometimes scooped water into their mouths from the toilet bowl. These damaged children in West Des Moines, Iowa, were not alone. There are scores of cases like this one involving starving kids to death. Other cases document children who have been beaten by parents most of their young lives or have otherwise been treated so severely for so long they can rightly be classified as torture victims. In one sense, the savage abuse inflicted on the Finn kids and in hundreds of other cases, including some in Ohio, is easily explained by the one thing they had in common: They were homeschooled. That may not explain how parents like Natalie Finns mother could reach such depths of depravity to starve her own daughter to death. Lax oversight of homeschooling provides a simple answer for why nobody noticed or reported the girl as she became little more than skin and bones. Her homeschooling ensured no teacher or other responsible adult would see the girl and detect the abuse. Natalies starving siblings and her mother were the only people who saw her during the last months of her life, when her body gradually thinned until she became so skeletal that any responsible person who got even a glance of her would have sounded the alarm. A kid her age and height should have weighed at least 125 pounds. When she died, she weighed 81. Its really hard to starve a child to death when that kids in school, said Rachel Coleman, co-founder and research director of the Coalition for Responsible Home Education, which is pushing for regulations to protect homeschooled kids. The group does not oppose parents teaching their children at home but it wants to prevent abusive parents from so easily making their kids invisible. From 2000 to last year, at least 320 homeschooled children were severely neglected and abused, often for years without detection, according to the Homeschoolings Invisible Children database kept by Colemans organization. Of those kids, 116 died. A disproportionate number of the children were adopted from foster care and the database indicates homeschooled kids die from abuse at a great rate than other children. Nobody sees these kids. Without any oversight, there is nothing to ensure a child is receiving an education or is seen by mandatory reporters, Coleman said. Homeschooling parents could lock a child up and no one would ever know. Think about it: Lax oversight provides a shield far more effective than anything some parents could ever devise on their own to to lock up their children and hide their torture and abuse. Along with starvation, physical torture and medical neglect, totally isolating kids from any contact with the outside world is a common form of parental abuse. Oversight of homeschooling in some states is non-existent. In most states, oversight is weak, at best. Nowhere in the United States do homeschool laws require welfare checks on the children involved to ensure they arent being abused or tortured. The most they require are academic assessments, either by parents or a certified teacher. Only a few states require those assessments be done by someone outside the home. All but two states allow convicted child abusers and other criminals to homeschool their kids. Calls to strengthen homeschooling regulations have come and gone over the years, with the net result actually being a weakening of oversight. Advocates for reform, though, have become as optimistic as they have been for years in large part because of the emergence of a group that had long been muted: former homeschooled students themselves. Coleman from the home education coalition was homeschooled. Ryan Stollar the co-founder of Homeschool Alumni Reaching Out, was a homeschooler, too. When homeschooling is done responsibly, it can be amazing, the group says on its website. What we oppose is irresponsible homeschooling, where the educational method is used to create or hide abuse, isolation, and neglect. Coleman and Stollar have attracted other former students who want reform and have quickly surged in status not only as leaders of reform efforts but also as credible voices that can gain the support of all but the most hard-core oversight opponents. The most extreme anti-oversight groups oppose any form of government involvement in homeschooling and they always will. Coleman and Stollar have changed the tone from previous reformers to appeal to less ideological homeschoolers, positioning themselves not as hostile outsiders but as pragmatic insiders pusing for reasonable child protections that would never face opposition in any context outside of homeschooling. The Responsible Education coalitions creation of a database details in graphic language hundreds of gruesome abuse cases involving homeschooled kids. Homeschooling can serve as a powerful tool in the hand of an abusive parent, according to the sister group that maintains the database, Homeschoolings Invisible Children. Numerous young adults who were homeschooled for part of their upbringing and attended public school for part of their upbringing have reported that their parents abuse was worse when they were homeschooled, as there was nothing to act as a check on their parents abuse. Among other measures the coalition has called for: Only Pennsylvania and Arkansas currently forbid homeschooling of kids whose parents have been convicted of child abuse and certain other crimes. Some states require none of the coalitions proposals. No state requires all of the measures. The Responsible Education coalition has identified nearly 20 cases of abused homeschoolers from Ohio since 2013. In the most recent case, a 13-year-old girl wasstarved, chained and raped by her stepfather and his son. The girls 9-year-old sister was also abused. Both girls, and their 10-year-old brother were homeschooled. Neighbors said they saw the girl eating out of the trash and then alerted child services, thinking the girl might be malnourished. Social workers found the girl to be well fed. After wetting the bed in May 2015, the 13-year-old was chained to a support beam in the basement. She was fed rotten food and forced to use a bucket as a toilet. Timothy Ciboro was sentenced to life in prison in Jan. 2017 after the 13-year-old used a spare key to escape from his house. A neighbor spotted the girl running away and called police. Ciboros son, Esteban, got 68 years in prison. Under Ohio law, homeschooling requirements include notifying the local school district that a parent intends to homeschool their child. Parents must have a high school diploma or GED, or find someone with a Bachelors degree to homeschool the children. Theres a remediation process for students who lag behind and need academic intervention. There appears to be little in the way of laws that are designed to protect homeschooled children. About 1.7 million children in the United States — or about 3.3 percent of kids — are homeschooled, including about 63,305 in Ohio, according to estimates from the National Center for Education Statistics. DROP-KICKED DOWN BASEMENT STAIRS While most homeschooling parents provide warm, nurturing environments for their children, University of Wisconsin pediatrician Barbara Knox found in a 2014 study on child torture that in 38 cases of severe child abuse, 47 percent of parents had either never enrolled or pulled their kids out of public schools when abuse was suspected. Her findings were based on reviews of only a small number of cases and while not statistically relevant, she identified the same pattern of abused homeschooled kids as the responsible home education coalition. Knoxs review also found the abused homeschool children received no true educational efforts, and the isolation was accompanied by an escalation of physically abusive events. Sabrina Rays brief, tortured life is another glaring example. At 16 years old, Sabrina weighed only 56 pounds when paramedics were called to her home last May in Perry, Iowa. She had often been so hungry that she ate what she could find rummaging through garbage cans. Police said that sometime after April 15, Sabrinas adult brother drop-kicked her down a basement staircase. She lay for days on the basement floor in excruciating pain, police said, unable to move until her emaciated body finally gave up. Like Natalie Finns mother, Sabrinas adoptive parents had previous involvement with child protection workers. Under reforms pushed by advocates for tighter homeschooling regulations, once the parents removed Sabrina from school, they would have faced close monitoring. Instead, the law allowed Sabrinas parents to make their daughter, and signs of her abuse, invisible. So was Liam Roberts, a 6-year-old boy in Jerseyville, Illinois. He dropped off the radar of adults who might have saved him two years ago after his father and stepmother, Michael and Georgena Roberts, were investigated by child protective services caseworkers for inadequate food in the home. Soon after, they began homeschooling Liam and his siblings. Liam died last week of extreme malnutrition. He weighed only 17 pounds, about a third the weight of a typical 6-year-old. Except in Pennsylvania, homeschool laws allow even parents who have been convicted of crimes like sexual assault or child abuse to hide their children from public view. A lack of oversight in California is what helped make the 13 children of David Allen Turpin and Louise Anna Turpin invisible to their Riverside County neighbors . The children, ages 2 to 29, were rescued in January after a 17-year-old escaped their house and called authorities. When police arrived at the home, they found ropes, chains and padlocks used to restrain and shackle the Turpin siblings to their beds. They were dirty and a putrid odor permeated the house. Investigators said parents had imprisoned their children for years. The adult children were so malnourished they looked like children. What happened to these poor souls has been a sadly familiar story to Coleman since the founding of the Coalition for Responsible Home Education. This was not new to us, said Coleman, whose organization keeps a database called Homeschoolings Invisible Children listing the names of hundreds of home-educated children who have been tortured and abused by their parents. The isolation and food deprivation, none of that was surprising. Its not even the first case of 13 children, but a photo with all the girls dressed the same created a moment of virality. The case drew increased scrutiny of homeschooling oversight, but Coleman believes the enormity of the problem has been understated. Her organizations Invisible Children database surely does not include every severely abused homeschooled kid or every child who died at the hands of their parents because no one knows where — or if — many kids are supposedly being schooled. HOMESCHOOLING NEITHER GOOD NOR BAD Of course, kids who attend public schools are often abused, too. Homeschooling has both advocates and critics, and many good parents whose children dont thrive in traditional classroom see it as a valuable option. Coleman is one of them. Her mother required standardized testing every three years, provided outlines of the curriculum to school officials and maintained a portfolio of Colemans academic achievements — part of keeping a good record, she said. At-home educations are neither good nor bad, said Coleman, whose doctoral candidacy in history at the University of Indiana represents a level of academic achievement not uncommon among homeschoolers. But in the hands of abusive parents, she said, homeschooling can lead to horrific abuse situations. Iowa opened the door for abuse five years ago when it sliced homeschooling regulations to almost nothing. Before the changes, Iowas homeschooling laws were among the most thorough in the country. State Sen. Matt said McCoy, who conducted an inquiry into Natalies and Sabrinas deaths, said that in some cases in which children are adopted from foster care, as the two girls were, home education is a complete ruse. Sabrina, for example, was not educated at home but rather worked at her parents Rays of Sunshine Daycare in Perry. McCoy called it slavery. HOMESCHOOL LAW REFORM EFFORTS McCoy is working on legislation to prevent parents from using homeschooling simply to hide their abuse. He wants mandatory annual physicals and dental checkups for the kids and a requirement that they be checked on by public school monitors every three months. Once we lose them in the system, no one knows what happens to them, he said. In California, Assemblyman Jose Medina, a Democrat whose district includes the area where the 13 Turpin children lived, said hes extremely concerned about the lack of oversight and is considering legislation to prevent a situation like this from occurring in the future. Lawmakers in several other states are rethinking the lack of oversight in homeschooling situations, too, but even modest reporting proposals have been killed over the years by the powerful homeschooling lobby. In fact, when homeschooling began to catch on in the 1980s, it faced significant government resistance. The practice was banned outright in some states and heavily regulated in others. Since then, homeschoolings lobby, led by the Home School Legal Defense Association, has led the charge for full parental control over their childrens education, in the process managing to weaken oversight considerably. The defense association, a creation of the religious right, has opposed states merely requiring that school districts be notified that kids being homeschooled arent attending public school not because their truant but because they are being taught at home. Beyond that, the defense association has been increasingly involved in defending homeschool parents accused of abuse and has worked to make investigations by Child Protective Services more difficult. To its homeschooling members who are approached by social workers, the association has advised: Never let the social worker in your house without a warrant or court order. All the cases that you have heard about where children are snatched from the home usually involve families waiving their Fourth Amendment right to be free from such searches and seizures by agreeing to allow the social worker to come inside the home. A warrant requires probable cause which does not include an anonymous tip or a mere suspicion.

488,"Ohio has 35 hate groups according to a report by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Over the past two years, the number of active hate groups in the United States has increased. Nationwide, the number of verified hate groups rose to 917 last year — up from 892 in 2015. According to the findings by the Southern Poverty Law Center, Ohio ranked eighth nationwide in the number of hate groups. California has the most hate groups in the nation, with 79. Neighboring Pennsylvania has 40 hate groups. In the Greater Cleveland area, the SLPC says there are four prominent hate groups. Those groups include the All Eyes on Egipt Bookstore, a black separatist group, Faith2Action, an anti-LGBT group, the Nation of Islam, a black separatist group, and Soldiers of Odin, an anti-Muslim group. The Southern Poverty Law Center, a nonprofit legal advocacy organization specializing in civil rights and public interest litigation, attributes much of the increase in hate groups to the rise of Trump. Throughout his presidential campaign and into his nascent presidency, Trump has voiced nationalistic ideals resonating with the extreme right wing fringe, officials said. Trumps run for office electrified the radical right, which saw in him a champion of the idea that America is fundamentally a white mans country, Southern Poverty Law Center officials wrote. Southern Poverty Law Center officials encapsulated the political events that have helped fuel the rise of hate groups throughout the country: A surge in right-wing populism, stemming from the long-unfolding effects of globalization and the movements of capital and labor that it spawned, brought a man many considered to be a racist, misogynist and xenophobe into the most powerful political office in the world, officials said. Donald Trumps election as president mirrored similar currents in Europe, where globalization energized an array of extreme-right political movements and the United Kingdoms decision to quit the European Union. Trumps eventual election win galvanized the extreme right, emboldening its members to voice their extremist views and, worse, sometimes act on their hatred, according to officials. Their reclaimed energy has led them away from the shadows of society and into the mainstream in a manner not seen since the days of the desegregation effort that swept the country as part of the Civil Rights Era. After half a century of being increasingly relegated to the margins of society, the radical right entered the political mainstream last year in a way that had seemed virtually unimaginable since George Wallace ran for president in 1968, officials wrote. Southern Poverty Law Center officials produced an an interactive map that allows users to see concentrations of hate groups in their region. Here are the 10 states with the most hate groups: In Ohio, the majority of hate groups are either KKK, Neo-Nazis, White Nationalists, or Skinheads. These are the hate groups SLPC reports as active, and where they operate: Tony Cantu, Patch, contributed to this report Photo credit: Marek Peters / www.marek-peters.com via WikiMedia Commons",0,8,5
489,"Usama Khan was as frightened as everyone else on Ohio State Universitys campus when news of an active shooter was sent over the schools emergency broadcast system Monday. Eventually, everyone learned there was no shooter, but someone had driven a car driven into pedestrians and the driver went on a stabbing spree with a butchers knife. Khan was convinced the attacker wouldnt be associated with Islam and would instead be a student with personal problems that manifested in a hideous and heinous way. Then the world learned the attacker was Abdul Razak Ali Artan, an 18-year-old OSU student and Somalia-born refugee. I was shocked to learn that it was a Muslim attacker, Khan said. Prior to executing the attack, Artan posted to Facebook and decried the treatment of Muslims in America and referenced lone wolf terrorist attacks. Despite law enforcement officials and Ohio Gov. John Kasich cautioning against assigning a motive to Artans attack, many suggest the Facebook post is proof of a terrorism connection. There is now fear among Muslim and refugee communities in Columbus of retaliatory attacks against them. Besides being a Muslim, Khan is also an immigrant. He came to the United States from Pakistan in 1997. Hes 21 now and a senior at OSU. Hes studying biomedical engineering and applying to medical schools. He is also the leader of a small group for Muslim students called the Ahmadiyya Muslim Students Association. See Also I told our members that they may want to pray on their own for a few days, he said. I told them I have a car and I can pick them up. We can pray in someones apartment. The Refugee Community Another group that fears retaliation for Mondays attacks is Columbus refugee community. Several organizations throughout the city and on campus either declined to speak on the record or didnt return requests for comment. Emily Gray, a spokesperson for World Relief, an international relief agency that works with refugees and has offices in Columbus, said that in todays turbulent world, unfortunately, these types of attacks do happen. She said her organization would continue to try and create cities that welcome refugees and immigrants. All of our offices work closely with the communities that we serve. I think that we serve vulnerable people and we are aware of that all the time, Gray said. This makes us a bit more aware. We are there to serve. And will continue to be for a very long time. She added that all of the groups that World Relief serves go through a vigorous screening process. We begin that process when they arrive in the United States, she said. We do it through U.S. and international federal agencies, from the point that someone is referred to us from the United Nations. There are 16,569 refugees in the Columbus area, according to the Impact of Refugess 2015 Report. Somalians represent more than half of the refugees resettled into Franklin County since 2002. OSUs Somali Students Association posted a lengthy statement on Facebook following the attacks. It read, in part: The group also told members that if they experienced any type of backlash they should contact university police or call 911. You can read their entire statement in an embedded post below. Terrible for Our Communities Khan was further shocked when he read a 2015 piece by the campus newspaper, the Lantern, that profiled Artan on his first day at OSU. In that piece, Artan said that he was frightened to pray publicly on campus and that he believed the media was responsible for a growing bias against the Muslim community. If people look at me, a Muslim praying, I dont know what theyre going to think, whats going to happen, he told the Lantern. Khan said reading that article in the context of Mondays attacks was maddening. It takes away credibility from Islam, he said. Its terrible for the Muslim and Somali community, and now we have to pick up our pieces. This isnt what our culture and our religion teaches. However, Khan also said that he understood feeling out of place as a Muslim at Ohio State. Muslims have to pray five times a day, so Khan has had to pray in public places, like the school library. He adds that prior to praying there is a cleansing process that Muslims must go through, and when he goes to the restroom to wash up, he worries that hes going to weird others out. When people feel ostracized, thats when you lose them. Artan didnt feel like he was a Buckeye, and he didnt feel accepted. It causes people to distance themselves, and then maybe they become vulnerable, Khan said. While the community is reeling from yesterdays attacks, Khan said he still believes OSU is an inclusive place and that the the school will rally together. He noted that college students tend to be more progressive and open-minded, so his fear of a retaliatory attack on him or his groups members is relatively low. I still feel pretty safe on campus, but theres always the I dont know factor, he said. Someone may decide to retaliate against us because theyre feeling angry or distraught. Theres still fear out there.  Photo by Rick Uldricks, Patch",1,1,0
490,"OHIO - The US Department of Justice (DOJ) will send personnel to safeguard polling locations in Cuyahoga, Franklin and Hamilton Counties on Nov. 8 for the general election. Sending monitors to Ohio is part of a DOJ plan to deploy 500 personnel to 67 jurisdictions in 28 states. While the decision to send these poll monitors is fairly typical, it does follow the controversial decision by the Ohio 6th Circuit Court of Appeals to strike down a federal judges decision on new voter-intimidation laws. Those laws would have prevented people from verbally harassing voters and making it more difficult for voters to reach polling places. The bedrock of our democracy is the right to vote, and the Department of Justice works tirelessly to uphold that right not only on Election Day, but every day, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in a prepared statement. On Election Day itself, lawyers in the Civil Rights Divisions Voting Section will staff a hotline starting in the early hours of the morning, and just as we have sent election monitors in prior elections, we will continue to have a robust election monitors program in place on election day. No specifics were offered as to the places targeted for monitoring, save to say that the focus will be at sites where ...there are concerns about racial discrimination in the voting process; other times monitoring is done to ensure compliance with bilingual election procedures. A slew of voter intimidation cases have been decided in crucial swing states over the past week. States impacted by those decisions include: Nevada, Pennsylvania and Texas. The department will gather information on, among other things, whether voters are subject to different voting qualifications or procedures on the basis of race, color or membership in a language minority group; whether jurisdictions are complying with the minority language provisions of the Voting Rights Act; whether jurisdictions permit voters to receive assistance by a person of his or her choice if the voter is blind, has a disability or is unable to read or write; whether jurisdictions provide polling locations and voting systems allowing voters with disabilities to cast a private and independent ballot; whether jurisdictions comply with the voter registration list requirements of the National Voter Registration Act; and whether jurisdictions comply with the provisional ballot requirements of the Help America Vote Act. To further assist in such inquiries, the DOJ will deploy Spanish-speaking monitors as well as those fluent in Asian and Native American languages, officials said. Contact with local election officials will be maintained throughout the process, officials added. During their monitoring, Civil Rights Division staff members will be available by telephone to receive complaints related to possible violations of the federal voting rights laws, official said. The toll-free number to call with complaints is 1-800-253-3931 or 202-307-2767 or TTY 202-305-0082). Voters also can report complaints by fax to 202-307-3961, by email to voting.section@usdoj.gov0r via the departments website: www.justice.gov/crt/votercomplaint.

491,"Police in Garfield Heights have arrested a 16-year-old male resident for making threats to area schools and individuals on Instagram over the weekend. The suspect is being charged with inducing panic and menacing. Police say there was no credibility to the suspects threats. The juvenile told Garfield Heights Detective Gary Menary that he was just following a national trend of creepy clown threats to schools and individuals and that he never intended to actually hurt anyone. The suspect is believed to have been behind the clownbitch23 Instagram account that made direct threats to Garfield Heights High School and Euclid High School in posts. That account posted a picture with the words Garfield high school tm and wrote, Murder spree on the gang man... at 2 a.m. Monday morning. The account also posted a picture of a clown and then re-posted the same photo several times, each time with a threat or slur in the caption. Several other copycat accounts popped up shortly after the original post and began making similar threats. Schools in Garfield Heights, Beachwood, Eastlake, Euclid, Orange, Shaker Heights and Twinsburg were placed on high alert following similar threats. The clownbitch23 account user also wrote that while everyone was commenting on his post, thinking he was joking, he was serious about his threats. The account drew nearly 2,800 followers in less than 24 hours. Several of the posts on the account were graphic and used racial slurs. The account was deleted as of Wednesday morning. Menary says that his department worked with Instagram to determine the identity of the suspect and was able to make an arrest within 24 hours of becoming aware of the threats. One copycat account that may have spawned as a result of the 16-year-olds threats was the notclowningaround12 account, which made several threats to east side schools. Eastlake police determined the account was being run by three Eastlake Middle School students on Monday and arrested two 12-year-olds and one 11-year-old. Eastlake Police Chief Lary Reik says the girls themselves were also likely inspired by recent national headlines about clown-related pranks and crimes. Police say the girls were remorseful and gave full confessions. Charges will be reviewed with the Juvenile Prosecutor and the department diversion program. You can see the Eastlake Police Departments Facebook post on the incident below: These incidents are merely the latest in a series of creepy clown sightings, pranks, and crimes that have spread across the United States. So far, about a dozen people have been arrested in multiple states, and there have been creepy clown reports in at least 28 states, according to media reports. The first creepy clown report was in South Carolina in mid-August when a group of children told a sinister tale of clowns living in an abandoned house in the woods and trying to entice them with money to follow them into the woods, The New York Times reported. Police werent sure at the time if the sightings were real or the product of childrens imaginations. As the craze has spread, creepy clown sightings have become something of an urban legend. However, police are getting serious about the epidemic of creepy clown reports that have resulted in school lockdowns in Reading, Ohio and Alabama. One of the first incidents in Ohio involving clowns was in mid-September when the town of Norwalk briefly developed clown fever that sent police on a wild goose chase through town in the middle of the night. Residents reported seeing clowns breaking into their house, clowns hiding in the woods, and motorcycle gangs hunting the clowns down. In the end, most of the residents recanted their stories and two teenagers were arrested for inciting panic after their picture, of themselves dressed as clowns, went viral and spooked the entire city. Why are the reports spreading? Experts have weighed in with some possible explanations. David G. Myers, a professor of psychology at Hope Collegein Holland, Michigan, told The New York Times the reports, which he called mass hysteria, play to peoples fears. Jason D. Seacat, an associate professor of psychology at Western New England University in Springfield, Massachusetts, said people who perpetuate the hoax with reports may just want to be part of a national news event. Since the event appears to be difficult to verify, the claim that one has had such an encounter is easier to make and relatively free from the risk of being called out as a fraud, he said in an email to The Times. So, low risk of being called out for lying and the benefit of positive attention for reporting such a claim may motivate some people to lie. After similar phenomena occurred in the 1980s in Boston, Loren Coleman, a cryptozoologist who studies the folklore behind mythical beasts such as Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster, developed The Phantom Clown Theory, which chalked it up to mass hysteria, usually as a result of childrens reports, CNN reported. Children arent that fond of clowns to begin with, according to a 2008 study in England that concluded decorating childrens wards in hospitals with clown images may give already ill children the heebie jeebies. As adults we make assumptions about what works for children, Dr. Penny Curtis, a researcher with the University of Sheffield, told BBC at the time. We found that clowns are universally disliked by children. Some found them quite frightening and unknowable. In the United States, fear of clowns may have been sparked by 1970s serial killer John Wayne Gacy, who had a childrens party gig as Pogo the Clown and also painted clown pictures. Scary movie clowns followed, including Pennywise, the clown from Stephen Kings 1990 movie It. See also: Patch Editor Beth Dalbey contributed to this story. Photo from Patch files",0,8,5
492,"Twelve-year-old Uriah Sharpes first day as a paperboy was anything but ideal. When he mistakenly delivered newspapers to the wrong houses, and went to retrieve them, police were called. Why? His mom says its about race. First day of paper route and we are pulled over by police, said Brandi Sharpe, the paperboys mother, on social media. Sad I cant even teach my son the value of working without someone whispering and looking at us out the side of their eye perhaps because we DONT look like a person that belongs in their neighborhood. A neighbor had reportedly spotted them on Friday retrieving the bags from some front lawns and thought they seemed suspicious. The caller said she had seen people approaching houses, empty-handed, and leaving with a bag of something. So the cops checked it out. While officers quickly determined that nothing nefarious was going on, Brandi said she is totally disgusted this kind of behavior still exists. She believes the race of her son played a part in the police being called. Sharpe said she is going to have her sons paper route changed to avoid the neighborhood in the future. For their part, Upper Arlington police have denied any racial bias in the incident. The department said a recent law change requires papers to be delivered to specific locations, like a mail slot or porch, to reduce littering. They believe ignorance of that change prompted a resident to call police on the Sharpes. Residents are seeing this change in approach but may not be aware of the new law, they said on Facebook. The incident in Columbus comes less than two weeks after police were called on a team of black children — ages 9-13 — that were mowing a neighbors lawn in Maple Heights. The children allegedly mowed part of another persons lawn, prompting them to call the police on the children. (For more news like this, find your local Patch here.

493,"A graffiti vandal defaced the with anatomical art and the words this way to hell accompanied by an arrow – but dont think it was a case of religious persecution. Police Chief Michael McNeely said that was the departments concern until it was learned that a male sexual organ had also been spray painted on the Sterling Inc. corporate sign on Ghent Road in Akron, less than three miles from the synagogue. A representative of the 646 N. Revere Road synagogue called police at 9:31 a.m. March 31 to report that an unknown person had used spray paint and a marker to deface the side of their building, electrical box, storage unit and a dumpster. We dont believe (the graffiti) was targeted toward the synagogue … (but) we always have a heightened awareness around the religious institutions, McNeely said. The department photographed the vandalism, which the chief said was likely committed by a young person. Police have contacted area school officials asking for their assistance in identifying a suspect or suspects. If they hear anything theyre going to give us a call, McNeely said.

495,"Leaders of Kents police, fire and religious organizations solemnly marked the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks in a brief ceremony Thursday before a big-band performance in Home Savings Plaza. The commemoration may have marked the deaths of thousands, but those who spoke also talked about the good things that came of that horrible day — unity and patriotism among them. The Rev. David Pattee, of the , called the terrorist attacks an eruption of evil that still troubles the nation. We saw a hate and violence. We felt fear and grief, Pattee said. We also saw on that horrible day an outpouring of great courage and caring, kindness and generosity, nowhere more clearly than the dedication and sacrifice of first responders who rushed into danger so that others could be saved. Chief Michelle Lee pointed to the lessons learned in fighting terrorism that today help keep us safer from similar attacks. Our world has changed, she said. Police work has changed, but it doesnt necessarily mean for the worse. Locally, Lee said since 9/11 the department dedicated an officer to a multi-jurisdictional terrorist task force. And Kent police re-evaluated how to protect the citys power sources, water supply, government buildings and communication devices. In a way, the attacks helped first responders learn how to better prevent and protect from the same kind of terror, she said. So while we continue to mourn the losses of our police, firefighters and other heroes of 9/11, take faith that their deaths were not in vain, Lee said. Here in our town of Kent, we challenge ourselves daily to ensure the safety and security of everyone we serve. Capt. Dave Manthey described firefighting not as a job but as a calling, and he said its work theyll continue to do in the face of terrorism. He added that firefighters dont consider themselves heroes. We are your neighbors, Manthey said. We go to your churches … and sometimes, we have a beer downtown. We will risk it all to keep others out of harms way, he said. Its what we do, and its who we are. On Sept. 11, 2001, 343 of my brothers paid the ultimate price for what we do. Thursdays ceremony, which included performances by the Western Reserve Community Band, marked Kents official commemoration of the terrorist attacks.

496,"William Jones has been indicted for a crime spree that started in Euclid, with the murder of Jared Plesec, a 21-year-old Salvation Army worker, and ended with a series of carjackings, assaults and a shooting in Lakewood. While all murders offend the peace and dignity of our community, this crime is especially cold-blooded and appears to be racially motivated, said Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Michael OMalley in a statement. Our office is consulting with federal prosecutors to see if this homicide and subsequent crime spree qualify as hate crimes and/or civil rights crimes under the federal statutes. Jared Plesec, the killed 21-year-old, was reportedly wearing a Salvation Army uniform at the time of his death. He was volunteering at a senior living home when Jones reportedly walked up to him and shot him in the side of the head, OMalley said. A Cleveland city councilman told Patch that Plesec was clutching a Bible when he was killed. Jones, 27, then reportedly went on a crime spree. He attempted to rob two men in a car at gunpoint on E. 156th St., according to the indictment. The driver didnt stop and sped away and Jones fired three shots at the car. Jones then allegedly robbed a woman on E.156th Street and stole her car. From there, he drove to the E. 72nd Marina and robbed a 53-year-old man, again at gunpoint, the indictment says. He then drove a stolen car into Lakewood. As he sped through the Metroparks near the Lakewood and Rocky River border, a group of joggers yelled at him to slow down. Jones then reportedly stopped the car and fired his gun at the joggers. He hit a 36-year-old woman in the leg. OMalley said the woman was seriously hurt. Jones then reportedly attempted a fourth carjacking, near the exit of the Metroparks. He failed. His gun was now-empty, so he threw it into a field at the Metroparks, OMalley said. The gun was later recovered by police. Jones then found a pick-up truck, which had been left unoccupied, with keys in it, on Sloan Ave. in Lakewood. He drove the truck to the Marine Towers on Edgewater Dr., where he attacked a 56-year-old woman, the indictment says. He reportedly threw her to the ground and stole her car. He then crashed the car through the closed garage doors at Marine Towers and then hit several cars on Edgewater Drive. He was then boxed in by Lakewood Police and surrendered. From Collinwood to Lakewood, thats 20 miles of a crime spree, its incredible, on a Saturday morning. When they told me [what had happened], I was just in disbelief. I had to back off. I was so angry and outraged. This is so senseless. This wasnt an altercation. This was cold-blooded murder, said Cleveland City Councilman Michael D. Polensek, Ward 8. Polensek knew the murdered 21-year-old, Plesec, from their joint work with the Salvation Army. Polensek went on to say that he wants the maximum punishment possible for Jones. He added, The death penalty is too good for [Jones]. Jones faces a 35-count indictment that includes charges of aggravated murder, murder, attempted murder, aggravated robbery, felonious assault, burglary, vandalism, discharging a firearm on or near prohibited premises, grand theft and failure to comply.

497,"Two swastikas were painted on the driveway of a Belle Avenue home between late Tuesday and early Wednesday. Someone also smashed a window out on a vehicle parked at the Belle Avenue home and a third swastika was found painted in the street on Belle. Police are investigating the incidents, a spokesperson told Patch. Police say the incidents took place sometime between late Tuesday and early Wednesday. The victim had no idea who would target them for this kind of attack. During a follow-up investigation, police found a third swastika painted on the street, in front of a neighboring Belle Avenue home. Police continue to investigate the incident and if anyone has information that may aid that investigation, they are asked to contact Lakewood Police at 216-521-6773. Several prominent community members have already commented with revulsion over the vandalism. After originally posting a photo of the swastikas, Ohio Representative Nicki Antonio deleted her picture and said, ...somehow it seems to give the symbols too much energy. She added that the painting of the symbols was a sickening act. I live on Belle and it is a street with many children and much love and much looking out for each other. We will not accept this escalation and use of symbols of hate in our community or our country. We must all say no to this wave of hate and fear that grips our nation right now, Antonio said in a post on Facebook. (Subscribe to the Patch Lakewood newsletter for local news and updates.) Lakewood works very hard to maintain vibrant, inclusive and safe neighborhoods, and this type of shock graffiti has no place in Lakewood, Lakewood Mayor Mike Summers said in a statment. Hateful acts must be condemned and confronted whereever they occur. Our Police Department will work very hard to identify and prosecute the parties responsible for this violent and repulsive act. The painting of symbols connected to the white nationalist movement comes as Ohio finds itself connected to the racially motivated violence in Charlottesville, Virginia. James Alex Fields Jr., 20, from Maumee, drove a car into a crowd of counter-protesters at the rally near the University of Virginia campus. He reportedly hit and killed Heather Heyer, 32.

The shooting occurred near the 1300 block of West Clifton Boulevard just before 11 p.m. The teen was transported to MetroHealth Hospital where he was treated and released. A description of the suspect led police to Denzel Johnson, 26 also of Lakewood. Johnson was arrested and charged with felonious assault. According to a news release, the Lakewood High School student told CAIR-Cleveland, a local Muslim civil rights group, that he was walking home from his part-time job when Johnson called him a terrorist and a Taliban b---h before shooting him and fleeing. The Cleveland chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) says that at the time of the shooting, the teen was wearing a traditional Islamic head covering called a Kufi. CAIRs national office points out that there has been an increase in incidents targeting American Muslims and other minority groups since the Nov. 8 presidential election and is urging the nations leaders to repudiate growing Islamophobia. At this time, the Lakewood Police are not considering the incident a hate crime; Capt.

501,"By A 24-year-old man was sentenced today to 15 years to life in prison for a heroin-fueled hit-and-run collision that killed a bicyclist in Newport Beach. Neil Storm Stephany was convicted of second-degree murder for the collision that killed 30-year-old Shaun Eagleson of Fountain Valley on Oct. 19, 2014. Stephany, who typically would have faced a manslaughter charge, was charged with murder because of a prior conviction for driving under the influence in October 2011. In the resolution of DUI cases, drivers are warned if they get into a deadly crash they could face a murder charge. Senior Deputy District Attorney Jennifer Walker asked Orange County Superior Court Judge Gary Paer to tack on four more years to the defendants sentence because of probation violations. Eaglesons wife tearfully told Paer how the collision not only killed her husband, but her long-delayed prospects for having a child. She read a letter to her unborn baby to the judge that described how she had battled back against celiac disease and had just been told she was healthy enough to get pregnant when the deadly accident happened. Stephany killed someone else that day -- the baby we worked so hard to have, Sandra Eagleson said. When she was 18 she was told she may not be able to have children, she said. The news made her stop believing in miracles, but then, I met a boy and this one was different. As Eagleson proposed to her, she told him he didnt want her because she couldnt make him a father, she said. I dont care if you cant have a baby, we can always adopt, she said he told her. We were so close to having you, Sandra Eagleson said in the letter to the dreamed-of baby. We were finally ready, but then something happened, something ruined me forever. Someone selfish killed you both. Shaun Eagleson had just started a business in Huntington Beach selling audio equipment. He was an avid music lover of every genre who enjoyed writing songs, his wife said. Eaglesons mother, Sylvia Zaldivar, told the judge, Shaun was killed a year ago and it feels like yesterday. No punishment would be enough, Zaldivar said. No matter how much time this killer gets it wont be enough, she said. I (expletive) hate him. I hate him. Zaldivar vowed to go to every parole board hearing to oppose Stephanys release. Stephany wrote a letter to Eaglesons family apologizing for his crime. I am truly sorry for the anguish I have caused you, he wrote. I take full responsibility in my actions as they have been quite selfish. This entire situation pains me deeply. I cant imagine how you feel. If nothing else, I hope the letter can bring a bit of amity. I say this from the deepest place in my heart. I hope you accept my sincere apology. Stephanys attorney, Brian Gurwitz, said his client has had an impeccable record while in custody. Paer said Stephanys decision to shoot heroin before getting behind the wheel of the car was mind-boggling. Hopefully this case will send a message to the community that this type of conduct wont be tolerated, Paer said The collision happened about 5 p.m. on East Coast Highway. The victim was riding northbound when he was struck by the defendants Toyota Tacoma. Before the collision, calls were already streaming in to police about the defendants erratic driving on the San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor (73) toll road, according to Walker. After the deadly collision, police caught up with Stephany near Fashion Island, where he failed field sobriety tests and had fresh track marks from heroin use, Walker said. Blood tests showed the defendant had heroin and Lorazepam in his system, she said. He also had another drug on him that is used to help with heroin withdrawal, according to Walker, who said Stephany had intended to check into a rehabilitation facility the following day.

505,"Sentencing was delayed on Thursday until Oct. 13 for a Mexican Mafia member who also headed a San Gabriel Valley gang that targeted black victims. James Chemo Gutierrez, 53, pleaded guilty in April to three conspiracy counts involving racketeering, narcotics distribution and money laundering. Gutierrez, leader of the El Monte Flores gang, faces between 10 years to life in federal prison when he is sentenced by U.S. District Judge John A. Kronstadt. He was the lead defendant in a 41-person federal indictment detailing allegations of murder, kidnapping, drug trafficking, robbery, burglary, carjacking, witness intimidation and other offenses. The gang often committed hate crimes directed against African- Americans who might reside or be present in the cities of El Monte and South El Monte in an effort to rid these cities of all African-Americans, according to the 62-count indictment. Other gang-related crimes outlined in the 2014 document include the execution of a former Mexican Mafia member and the fatal shooting of four others in an El Monte home in 1995. The indictment also describes an ongoing dispute involving members of the Mexican Mafia who are attempting to exercise control over the gang. Gutierrez is currently in federal custody after his supervised release was revoked following a 20-year sentence in a federal homicide case. Other Mexican Mafia members serving life prison terms are not charged in the indictment, but they are listed as co-conspirators. The gang maintained a significant presence at the Boys & Girls Club in San Gabriel, where gang members openly sold drugs, held gang meetings and even held a car wash fundraiser, according to the indictment.Members of the gang also regularly used and threatened to use violence to extort taxes from local drug dealers and fraudulent document vendors, the indictment says. Prosecutors further outlined several incidents dating back to early 2001 in which black victims in El Monte were attacked, threatened and subjected to racial epithets. --City News Service/Shutterstock image",1,0,0
506,"Subscribe to News Alerts and a Daily Email Newsletter for Glendora Patch Murder, attempted murder and two hit-and-run charges were filed today against rap mogul Marion Suge Knight, who could face up to life in prison if convicted. Earlier today, a commissioner revoked Knights $2 million bail. Knight, 49, surrendered early Friday and was booked on suspicion of murder for allegedly running over two men with his truck in Compton on Thursday afternoon, killing one of them, and fleeing the scene. Knights bail status was amended -- his bail had been set at $2 million - - because he was deemed a possible flight risk and three-strikes candidate. According to a sheriffs statement, possible witness intimidation issues and a criminal past were also factors. Knight is scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday at the Compton courthouse. The complaint includes an allegation that he committed a serious and violent felony while out on bail in an unrelated robbery case, as well as use of a deadly weapon and causing great bodily injury allegations. Knight has prior convictions, making this a third-strike case, according to the complaint. The hit-and-run occurred around 2:55 p.m. Thursday in the parking lot of Tams Burgers in the 1200 block of West Rosecrans Avenue, near Central Avenue. Knight allegedly drove his pickup truck backward and forward, killing Terry Carter, 55, and injuring 51-year-old Cle Stone, who was treated at a hospital. Knights attorney, James Blatt, confirmed his client was behind the wheel of the pickup that struck the men, but said he acted out of fear in trying to escape as many as four people who attacked him. Blatt also claimed that Knight had been unaware that he had hit two men with the pickup, which was later found in a Westwood parking lot. Lt. John Corina, a sheriffs homicide detective, told reporters late last week that investigators believe Knight intentionally struck the men and that he was not acting out of a reasonable fear. Corina said Knight had gotten into an argument at a film shoot for a promotional video for Straight Out of Compton, a biopic of the Compton rap group N.W.A. Knight, and was told to leave. The argument resumed about 20 minutes later at the eatery about three miles away. Corina alleged the 51-year-old victim exchanged punches with Knight through the open window of his truck before the rapper intentionally ran him over, then struck Carter -- who had been standing next to Stone -- while accelerating forward. Knights lawyer described Carter as a friend of his clients, and Corina said the victim was not believed to have been involved in the altercation with Knight. The web site TMZ.com reported that surveillance cameras at the Tams Burgers crime scene were broken and that cameras at a nearby bank, drug store and a competing fast-food outlet were pointing away from the crime scene. Sheriffs deputies, however, have said they have video of the dispute. Knight is awaiting trial on a robbery charge stemming from the alleged theft of a camera from a paparazzo in Beverly Hills last September. He is charged in that case, along with comedian Micah Katt Williams, and faces up to 30 years to life in prison if convicted in the robbery case. Knight co-founded Death Row Records, which in its heyday in the early 1990s was generating revenues of about $100 million per year. He helped launch some of raps biggest acts, including Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg and Tupac Shakur, and was with Shakur the night he was slain in 1996. Knight served five years in prison for assault and federal weapons violations and, after his release in 2001, spent another 10 months behind bars for violating parole by hitting a Hollywood nightclub valet.  He was shot a half-dozen times last August at a Los Angeles-area nightclub. No arrests have been made in that case. --City News Service Also on Patch Delta Will Fly Larger Planes on Shuttle From LAX to San San Diego State University Sending Wine Program Abroad Suspected Sex Workers.

507,"Written by City News Service Reported hate crimes in Los Angeles County declined by 6 percent in 2012 from the previous year, marking the second lowest total in 23 years,  the county Commission on Human Relations announced today. According to its annual report -- which defines a hate crime as one where hatred or prejudice toward a victims race or ethnicity, religion, disability, gender or sexual orientation was a substantial factor -- there were 462 reported hate crimes countywide last year, a decrease of 27 from 2011. We are encouraged that for several years in a row the number of hate crimes in L.A. County has been about half of those reported in the late 90s and early 2000s, said commission Executive Director Robin Toma. About 50 percent of the 2012 crimes documented in the report were race- based, with 66 percent of those targeting blacks. The report showed that 68 percent of racially motivated crimes against blacks were committed by Latinos, and 58 percent of racially motivated crimes targeting Latinos were committed by blacks. Crimes based on sexual orientation increased from the previous year to 28 percent of all the hate crimes -- and were more likely to be violent than either racial- or religious-related hated crimes. Religious crimes, which were primarily anti-Semitic in nature, declined slightly from last year, constituting 19 percent of the total. It remains troubling that year after year, the overwhelming majority of hate crimes motivated by religion in Los Angeles County, statewide and across the country, is against Jews and Jewish institutions. said Amanda Susskind, regional director of the Anti-Defamation League, a civil rights group with a focus on documenting and fighting anti-Semitism. We remain concerned that African-Americans continue to be the most frequently targeted victims of hate crimes with nearly one-third of all reported hate crimes and two-thirds of racially motivated crimes, Susskind said.  And, not only did crimes against the LGBT -- lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender -- community increase, they also became even more likely to be of a violent nature compared to last year and still vastly more likely to be violent than either racial or religious crimes. The highest rate of hate crimes took place in the metro region stretching from West Hollywood to Boyle Heights. When accounting for population, the Antelope Valley tied with the metro area for the highest numbers. In the Antelope Valley, where federal officials recently found that sheriffs deputies had discriminated against black residents, some of the white supremacist organizations have long been active, Toma said. The commissions report was generated from data collected from sheriff and city police departments, school districts and community groups. However, officials are almost incapable of monitoring hate crimes taking place in cyberspace, Susskind noted.",0,8,5
508,"Laws to protect Californians from DUI offenders, help establish an earthquake early warning system, reform the California Public Utilities Commission, increase oversight of building contractors, require police to securely stow any handgun left in a car, improve tour bus safety, crack down on water-guzzling households, and more take effect on January 1. The new laws are the result of 17 bills that were introduced by Senator Jerry Hill, passed by the Legislature and signed by Governor Jerry Brown in 2016. Here are summaries of the bills that led to the new laws and what they do: Senate Bill 24 – JPA Pension Fix for San Mateo County Resolves a pension problem that prevented the cities of San Mateo, Belmont and Foster City from completing their Joint Powers Agreement for shared fire service. It allows the three cities to provide the JPA employees a defined benefit plan that those employees received as classic CalPERS members from their previous employment with the cities. San Mateo County Firefighters and the California Professional Firefighters supported SB 24, along with the cities of San Mateo, Belmont and Foster City. SB 62 – California Public Utilities Commission Office of the Safety Advocate Establishes the Office of the Safety Advocate within the California Public Utilities Commission to advocate for continuous, cost-effective improvement of safety management and safety performance of public utilities. SB 438 – Earthquake Early Warning Implementation Complements the $10 million included in the 2016-2017 budget for the statewide earthquake early warning system by establishing the Earthquake Early Warning Advisory Board within the Governors Office of Emergency Services. The new law brings California closer to statewide implementation of the earthquake early warning system. In emergencies, the alerts sent by the warning system will help prevent devastating and life-threatening missteps. Governor Browns announcement of his signing the bill is here and view video of the press conference held at the Office of Emergency Services headquarters here. SB 465 – Building Construction Contractors: Discipline, Reporting and Building Standards SB 465 is aimed at increasing oversight of contractors by closing the gaps in information that were revealed by the collapse of a balcony at a Berkeley apartment building on June 16, 2015. Ashley Donohoe, 22, of Rohnert Park, her cousin, Olivia Burke, 21, of Ireland, and four of their friends were killed. Seven other students from Ireland, including Aoife Beary who had been celebrating her 21st birthday, were hospitalized for weeks after the balcony gave way and sent them plummeting five stories to the ground. Aoife Beary, her mother Angela, Ashley Donohoes mother, Jackie, and representatives of the Irish Consulate testified to policy committees in the Capitol about the devastating loss felt by families from California to Ireland – and urged legislators to support SB 465, which was co-authored by Senator Loni Hancock, D-Oakland. The new law: SB 512 – Governance, Accountability and Transparency at the California Public Utilities Commission SB 512 reforms the governance structure of the California Public Utilities Commission by more clearly outlining the roles and responsibilities of commissioners and staff, and by requiring the CPUC to reach out to communities affected by CPUC decisions, instead of only to regulated utilities. To do so, SB 512 makes the following statutory changes: It 1) requires the commission to annually approve performance criteria for the commission and the executive director, and to annually evaluate the performance of the executive director based on those criteria; 2) requires the CPUC to reach out to those affected by its proceedings; 3) requires CPUC judges to adhere to ethics provisions of the Administrative Procedures Act; 4) allows the public to receive hearing transcripts at no charge; 5) permits the CPUC to meet in locations other than San Francisco; 6) requires the CPUC to modify its annual report to clarify how long the CPUC takes to finish rate or penalty cases; and 7) allows local governments to receive intervenor compensation when participating in CPUC efforts to improve safety, enabling local governments that have suffered catastrophes to seek such compensation. SB 661 – The Dig Safe Act of 2016 SB 661 addresses safety problems involving excavations and gas pipelines that are beneath soil or are otherwise underground by making clarifications to the so-called one-call law (Call 811 before you dig) and by creating the Safe Excavation Board, an appointed board of excavation stakeholders that is funded by fees on utilities. The board is to 1) investigate accidents and other one-call violations; 2) develop standards for safe excavation; and 3) coordinate education and outreach efforts. SB 812 – Improving Tour Bus Safety Improves the safety and oversight of tour buses operating in California by strengthening the California Highway Patrols tour bus inspection program. The law was prompted by a tour bus accident in San Franciscos Union Square in November 2015 that injured 20 people, at least five critically. After the crash, the CHP determined that the bus had never been inspected and was not registered with the California Public Utilities Commission, as is required by law. The CHP later conducted a surprise inspection of the companys bus fleet and found over 60 violations, 29 for mechanical problems. SB 814 – Cracking Down on Water-Guzzling Households During a Drought A winner of Senator Hills 2016 Oughta Be a Law…Or Not bill idea contest for constituents, SB 814 pulls the plug on excessive water use by households that flout mandatory reductions during drought emergencies. The law requires urban retail water suppliers to set rules for identifying and cracking down on households that consume enormous amounts of water despite restrictions imposed during a statewide declaration of a drought. The new law ensures that every urban retail water supplier has a tool to curb excessive water use by customers. Households that guzzle water – while neighbors and most other Californians abide by mandatory reductions – will no longer be able to hide and persist in their excess. SB 869 – Safe Storage of Police Handguns in Vehicles Another winner of Senator Hills 2016 Oughta Be a Law… contest, SB 869 responds to numerous thefts of handguns that law enforcement officers had left in cars. The stolen firearms included guns used in two murders in the Bay Area. SB 869 closes a legal loophole that had exempted law enforcement officers as well as concealed weapons permit holders from requirements to securely stow handguns in a lockbox out of plain view, or in the trunk, if the weapons are left in an unattended vehicle. SB 996 – Affordable Housing Property Tax Cap Aids local nonprofit and religious organizations that provide affordable housing by increasing the assessed property value exemption from $2,000,000 annually to $10,000,000 annually. The new law applies to three local nonprofits, such as the Saint Francis Center in Redwood City and the Ministry Services of the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul based in Los Altos Hills, which provides housing, food and clothing services to low-income families. SB 996 provides property tax relief to such organizations so that they can continue to provide more affordable housing for low income people and families. SB 1004 – Young Adult Offender Pilot Program Hailed by Governor Brown for its innovation, SB 1004 authorizes a pilot program in five counties, including Santa Clara, to give nonviolent young adult offenders between the ages of 18 and 21 the opportunity to take advantage of supportive and educational services in the juvenile justice system, rather than serve their time in an adult county jail. Although legally considered adults, these young offenders are still undergoing significant brain development, and may be better served by the juvenile justice system with age-appropriate, intensive services. Research shows that people do not develop adult-caliber, decision-making skills until their early 20s. Psychologists note that this maturity gap makes young adults more likely to engage in risk-seeking behavior. SB 1028 – Utility Wildfire Mitigation Plans SB 1028 requires 1) utilities regulated by the California Public Utilities Commission to file wildfire mitigation plans, 2) the CPUC to review those plans, and 3) publicly-owned utilities to also file wildfire mitigation plans with their governing boards. SB 1039 – Business and Professions Omnibus Bill SB 1039 makes several changes to the statutes governing various boards and bureaus under the Department of Consumer Affairs; includes specified fee increases for several boards including the Dental Hygiene Committee of California, the California Board of Optometry, the Board of Registered Nursing, the Board of Pharmacy, and the Contractors State License Board; and eliminates the Telephone Medical Advice Services Bureau. SB 1039 specifies that the continuing education standards established for nurses by the Board of Registered Nursing shall recognize specialized areas of practice, as previously required, and require that content be relevant to the practice of nursing, be related to the scientific knowledge or technical skills required for the practice of nursing, or be related to direct or indirect patient or client care. The legislation requires the nursing board to audit continuing education providers at least once every five years to ensure adherence to regulatory requirements. The new law also requires the board to withhold or rescind approval from any provider that is in violation of the regulatory requirements. SB 1046 – Ignition Interlock Devices for Drunk Driving Offenders Extends a pilot program requiring drunk driving offenders in Alameda, Los Angeles, Sacramento and Tulare counties to install the devices known as IIDs. IIDs are calibrated to the driver and prevent a car from starting if the driver is not sober. The four-county pilot would run until January 1, 2019, when the program would be expanded statewide with minor modifications so that: SB 1046 also creates an early incentive program, providing DUI offenders with full driving privileges soon after arrest if they install an IID. Their ultimate IID time requirement would be reduced based on when the early installation occurred. Low income offenders would be eligible for assistance to pay for an IID based on a sliding scale pegged to household income. SB 1192 – Private Post-Secondary Education SB 1192 changes the California Private Post-Secondary Education Act of 2009 to improve the effectiveness of the Bureau for Private Post-Secondary Education and opportunities for student success, and extends the BPPEs operations for four years. SB 1193 – Healing Arts, Board of Pharmacy, Veterinary Medical Board Sunset Bill SB 1193 makes changes to the Pharmacy Law, Veterinary Practice Act and Psychology Licensing Law to strengthen the laws and improve oversight of licensees by these boards. SB 1196 – Professions and Vocations: Bureau of Real Estate, Bureau of Real Estate Appraisers, and Bureau of Security and Investigative Services Bill SB 1196 ensures that the Bureau of Security and Investigative Services is subject to review by the appropriate policy committees of the Legislature. The legislation changes provisions in the Alarm Company Act, the Locksmith Act, the Private Investigator Act, the Private Security Services Act, Proprietary Security Services Act, and Collateral Recovery Act to improve the oversight, enforcement and regulation of licensees by the bureau. The bill also adds a sunset review date for the Bureau of Real Estate and the Bureau of Real Estate Appraisers, and changes existing laws to improve oversight, enforcement and regulation by the CalBRE and BREA. SB 1196 includes several consumer protection and public safety reforms to operations and oversight by the Bureau of Security and Investigative Services, which licenses about 380,000 companies and employees that provide alarm services, locksmith services, private investigation, private security, repossession services and firearm and baton training. The changes are intended to ensure that an applicant for licensure as an armed security guard is capable of exercising appropriate judgment, restraint and self-control; that armed security guards are qualified for their jobs, and that California regulators step up their policing of the industry. SB 1196 also imposes stricter training standards and requirements to ensure that shootings and incidents of suspected excessive force are investigated. In addition, the new law enables gun permits to be revoked when warranted and improves oversight of companies. – SUBMITTED FOR PUBLICATION BY: Office of State Senator Jerry Hill / Image via Shutterstock",0,8,5
509,"The following is a collection of weekly police, court and fire stories from around the Hermosa Beach area this week. The victim was pushed to the ground by one of the suspects at a South Bay Starbucks. The 18-year-old is accused of driving the getaway car in a fatal South Los Angeles shooting.F The man was holding an Airsoft or pellet gun that was very realistic-looking, Sheriffs Lt. Rodney Moore told reporters. Police responding to a report of a gunman in Redondo Beach shot and killed the suspect, who turned out to be armed with a pellet gun.

510,"The state Supreme Court refused Wednesday to review the case against an Iraq war veteran who killed his girlfriend about a month after she gave birth to their daughter and then claimed that he was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Tymarc D. Warren was convicted in August 2013 of first-degree murder for the Jan. 8, 2011, attack on Eileen Elizabeth Garnreiter, who was stabbed and slashed 16 times inside their Lawndale home. In a ruling last November, a three-justice panel from Californias 2nd District Court of Appeal rejected the defenses contention that there were errors in Warrens trial at the Torrance courthouse. The appellate court justices found that there was overwhelming evidence of premeditation and deliberation. Defendant punched Garnreiter in the eye, held her in a chokehold and manually strangled her before any stabbing took place. Defendant thus had overpowered Garnreiter and could have stopped his assault at any time, the appeals court panel found in its 45-page ruling. The justices noted that Warren told sheriffs deputies when they arrived at the home that he had killed the 22-year-old woman because he had hate in his heart and that the devil put it there. The panel concluded there was strong evidence of defendants guilt of first-degree murder, and that jurors were properly instructed on first-degree murder, second-degree murder and manslaughter. Forensic experts testified that the aspiring international law student was stabbed, punched in the face and choked hard enough to cause blood bruises and hemorrhaging. Warren said he couldnt recall everything that happened, which his attorney, Louisa Pensanti, argued was because he was suffering from PTSD following his time in Iraq, a diagnosis supported by an expert witness for the defense. She argued that her client should be convicted of manslaughter, not murder. Warren testified that he was trying to calm Garnreiter down when he grabbed her by the neck and choked her. Deputy District Attorney Frank Dunnick countered that the attack was provoked because Garnreiter was planning to leave him -- even posting her intentions on Facebook. Warren, a radio technician during his time in Iraq, heard the sounds of crashing mortars during his military service, but never came under fire, the prosecutor said. Just before being sentenced to 26 years to life in state prison in December 2013, Warren turned to face his girlfriends family and friends and said he wished there was a part of our judicial system where I can apologize to each and every one of you. ... That this process comes so late is disturbing ... I am sorry. He maintained that he was never violent with Eileen. This one incident got out of control really fast, he said, telling the victims family that he still loved the 22-year-old woman and urging them to take care of his young daughter, Lailah. Garnreiter had been a starting player on the softball team at El Camino College in Torrance and a 4.0 GPA student who had been accepted for transfer to UCLA, according to www.eileensfoundation.org, which is run by the victims aunt, Cathy Johnson, in tribute to her niece. --City News Service, photo via Shutterstock",0,8,5
511,"A reward has grown to nearly $35,000 for information leading to whoever set an arson fire at the Manhattan Beach home of a black family, spurring concerns of a racially motivated attack, the citys fire chief said today. The fire was set early on Feb. 4 at the front entrance of the home in the 700 block of 11th Street, according to the Manhattan Beach Fire Department. The fire from all indications appears to have been purposely set on the front porch ..., according to a Manhattan Beach Police Department statement. The motivation for this crime has not been determined. However, all possible motives, including this being a hate crime, are being investigated. We have not ruled out any possibility.

Ron Clinton, who lives in the house with his wife and three children, said he fears his family may have been targeted because they are black, explaining that someone set the fire, using an accelerant, and they are the only black family in the area. Clinton said he didnt know of any disagreement or beef with anyone who might have resorted to arson, but his wife, a lawyer who was out of town when the fire was set, believes they were targeted in a hate crime. Until I have proof to the contrary, we were targeted because of the color of our skin, Malissia Clinton told reporters. We are African-Americans. Weve been African-Americans all our lives, living in this country and we are allowed to reach conclusions based on our experience. That is my entitlement. What I can say is that the community has rallied behind us and we think its isolated. We dont think the community is racist. Hundreds of people turned out for a candlelight vigil in support of the family and someone solicited money through the fundraising site Fundly.com for a reward in the case. As of Tuesday, the fund had grown to nearly $35,000, according to Manhattan Beach Fire Chief Robert Espinosa. Contributions to the fund can be made by visiting the website and searching for fire bombed neighbor, he said. Meanwhile, local police and fire authorities continue to investigate the fire with assistance from the FBI, federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and other agencies, Espinosa said. Fire investigators continue to analyze the physical evidence for information that can connect this crime to a suspect, Espinosa said. With the assistance of the Manhattan Beach Police Department, FBI, ATF, Joint Regional Intelligence Center and Los Angeles County Sheriffs we are processing electronic information and comparing the evidence to similar crimes.

Police arrested two 18-year-olds and 17-year-olds allegedly coming out of a home with loot. They are suspected of other burglaries. A small brushfire broke out near Dodgers Stadium Monday afternoon. Authorities found the body of a man believed to have fallen into the water when a pedal boat capsized in Echo Park Lake. A wild rolling gun battle that ended with a hostage situation at Trader Joes claimed one life: 27-year-old store manager Melyda Corado. The cause of the Friday morning fire remains under investigation. Image via Shutterstock",1,2,0
514,"A Latino gang member from Highland Park who spent more than 15 years on the run in connection with a racially motivated murder could be sentenced Monday to 20 years in federal prison if the judge is convinced that survivors and witnesses approve. Merced Shadow Cambero, 39, pleaded guilty in February to felony counts of conspiracy against rights, interference with federally protected activities, and use or discharge of a firearm during a crime of violence causing death. The case against Cambero and his co-defendants marked the first time the federal hate crime statute had been used to combat racial violence by members of a street gang, according to the U.S. Attorneys Office. Cambero admitted he shot 38-year-old Kenneth Wilson, a black man who was looking for a parking space in Highland Park in April 1999, as part of a pact with other Avenues members to use violence, intimidation and harassment to force blacks out of the mostly Latino neighborhood. Before he took the defendants plea on Feb. 16, U.S. District Judge Percy Anderson demanded Cambero state exactly why he murdered Wilson. Tell me in your own words what you did in April 1999, the judge asked. I shot him, Cambero replied, not expecting an interrogation. And why? Anderson, who is himself black, continued. He was a different color, the defendant responded, looking down. And thats why you decided to shoot him? the judge asked. Yeah. The plea hearing was delayed after Anderson called a recess to be sure that witnesses and relatives of the defendants victims were aware that a plea deal had been struck and that they had an opportunity to attend the hearing. The courtroom that day was empty aside from Camberos family members and a City News Service reporter. Dont the victims have a right to be notified of the plea agreement - - and dont they have a right to be here? the judge asked prosecutors. And dont they have a position on the plea agreement? Prosecutors promised they would find out if the victims family members had been notified. Hours later, Assistant U.S. Attorney Barbara Bernstein of the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division told the judge that family members of the victim had been contacted and they supported the plea agreement. Wilsons relatives said they would attend the subsequent sentencing hearing, the prosecutor said. According to his plea deal, Cambero can expect to be sentenced to 20 years behind bars, followed by a five-year term of what prosecutors called particularly stringent supervised release. However, Anderson made clear that he was not bound by the deal and could sentence Cambero to a term up to and including life behind bars. At sentencing, the court will make a determination whether it will accept the plea agreement, Anderson said, adding that if he does not approve the deal, he will give Cambero a chance to withdraw his guilty plea or go forward with sentencing. If sentencing does take place Monday, Anderson said he might impose a greater length of time than is indicated in the agreement. Cambero was taken into custody by Mexican authorities in Baja California and turned over to the FBI at the border last year. He was one of three shooters who gunned down Wilson, who died of a gunshot wound to the neck, court papers show. Cambero is a member of the Avenues gang, which waged a campaign of terror against blacks in Highland Park. In 2006, three fellow members of the Avenues gang were sentenced to life in federal prison as part of the six-year conspiracy that also saw another black man gunned down at a bus stop in December 2000. A fourth man was convicted as a lookout in that 2000 slaying of Christopher Bowser. In its sentencing position, the government said it recognizes that the crimes in the case are among the most serious in the penal code, and that, if there were no other factors to take into consideration, imprisonment for life would be a just punishment. However, based on a number of powerful considerations -- including the desire of almost every witness and victim to avoid the terrifying prospect of again having to testify about violent gang activity; evidentiary concerns raised by the fact that the evidence is now 20 years old; and the desire of the victims, witnesses, and government for definite and final justice -- the prosecution entered into plea negotiations to determine if a just resolution could be reached without the need for another trial. Bernstein wrote that Camberos plea agreement would subject him to five years of particularly stringent supervised release that includes, among other conditions, a requirement that the defendant submit, at any time of the day or night by any law enforcement or probation officer, to warrantless and suspicion-less searches of his person, property, residence, vehicles, papers, computers, and phones. That provision will allow for close monitoring of Cambero and would help ensure that if he violates any law or any term of his supervised provision, his release can be revoked and he can be returned to prison, Bernstein wrote in the document. In a hand-scrawled letter to the judge, Cambero apologized to everyone in Highland Park for all the hurt I caused as a member of the Avenues gang. He wrote that he often thinks of the now-deceased mother of the man, Mr. Wilson, that I killed on Avenue 52 that night 20 years ago.

515,"A 25-year-old man arrested in connection with a series of arson fires and vandalism targeting Southland houses of worship pleaded not guilty Monday to nearly two dozen criminal charges. Christian Michael Garcia appeared in a downtown courtroom on 20 felony charges -- 13 counts of vandalism of a religious property, three counts of arson of a structure, two counts of second-degree commercial burglary and one count each of attempted second-degree robbery and arson of property -- plus two misdemeanor counts of vandalism under $400. The criminal complaint also includes hate crime allegations. He was ordered to return on March 21, when a date is expected to be set for a preliminary hearing to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to proceed to trial. Garcia has been held in lieu of $750,000 bail since his arrest Jan. 25 and, if convicted as charged, faces a maximum sentence of more than 23 years in prison. He was arrested by the Inter-Agency House of Worship Task Force in connection with crimes that took place between Nov. 25, 2016, and Jan. 25, at four churches in Pasadena and Los Angeles. Garcia is also charged with vandalizing the sheriffs station in Industry. Arson is an egregious crime in all forms, but acts of arson against houses of worship are especially harmful as they are a violation against a holy sanctuary, a sanctuary that often anchors an entire neighborhood, that offers a place of peace and spirituality for the community, Los Angeles Fire Department Chief Ralph Terrazas said at the time of Garcias arrest. The most recent fires were at Resurrection Church on Jan. 25 in Boyle Heights and the Church of the Angels in Pasadena on Jan. 13. The 2 a.m. fire at Resurrection Church in the 3300 block of East Opal Street kept 60 firefighters busy for nearly 30 minutes. They were able to prevent the flames from spreading to the main sanctuary. The Pasadena blaze at the 129-year-old Episcopalian Church of the Angels broke out at 2:20 a.m. Jan. 13 at 1100 N. Avenue 64. It was classified as a hate crime, according to fire officials, who said a few historic statues were significantly damaged, and there was fire and smoke damage inside the church. Los Angeles Police Department Chief Charlie Beck said Garcia was literally caught red-handed while he was allegedly about to vandalize Mount Olive Church of Christ in God in South Los Angeles. Following the arrest, Mayor Eric Garcetti hailed the work of investigators for helping people feel safer in houses of worship. These crimes are difficult to understand, the mayor said. We dont know the motive. But we do know that when we stand together strong in the face of this senseless hate, this city will always rise. City News Service; Photo: Shutterstock",1,3,1

Merced Shadow Cambero, 38, was ordered detained and will appear Monday before a federal judge in downtown Los Angeles for the setting of a trial date, according to the U.S. Attorneys Office. He was not immediately asked to enter a plea. In 2004, Cambero and four fellow alleged members of the Avenues gang were charged with conspiracy against rights, interference with federally protected activities, aiding and abetting, and use or discharge of a firearm during crime of violence causing death. The case marked the first time the federal hate crime statute had been used to combat racial violence by members of a street gang. During the ensuing three years, Camberos co-defendants were convicted and sentenced to life terms in federal prison for their roles in a gang-related conspiracy that led to the murders of two black men in the mostly-Latino neighborhood claimed by the gang, prosecutors said. Christopher Bowser was shot while waiting at a bus stop in Highland Park on Dec. 11, 2000, and Kenneth Wilson was gunned down while looking for a parking space in Highland Park on April 18, 1999.

519,"BY FRED SHUSTER LOS ANGELES (CNS) - Following a seven-year downward trend, reported hate crimes in Los Angeles County numbered 483 last year -- up from 390 such crimes in 2014, the county Commission on Human Relations announced today. According to its annual report -- which defines a hate crime as one in which hatred or prejudice toward a victims race or ethnicity, religion, disability, gender or sexual orientation was a substantial factor -- the county watchdog group said hate crimes last year jumped 24 percent from 2014, the largest number reported since 2011. The escalation came as the number of hate crimes statewide increased by a far-smaller 10 percent in 2015, according to the survey. We are extremely concerned that reported hate crimes increased dramatically in 2015, said Robin Toma, the commissions executive director. The disturbing rise in bias-motivated crime indicates that despite the gains made by historically marginalized communities, bigoted attacks are still a daily occurrence -- and that is unacceptable. As in past years, the largest number of hate crimes targeted blacks who represent only about 8.3 percent of county residents but were 58 percent of victims of racial hate crime. A significant factor driving the over- representation of black hate crime victims are racially-motivated attacks by street gangs, mostly those with ties to the prison-based Mexican Mafia gang, according to the commission. Other groups were targeted last year. Anti-Latino crimes jumped 69 percent, and there were increases in bigoted attacks on Jews, gay men, lesbians, Muslims, Asian Americans, Armenians and transgender women. Anti-Muslim and Middle Eastern crimes spiked in November and December following the terrorist attacks in San Bernardino and internationally. History has taught us that global events and political rhetoric directly impact hate activity, according to the civil rights organization Advancing Justice-LA. In 2015, we witnessed rising hostility towards China on trade and economic issues and the tragic attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, as well as presidential campaign rhetoric that both targeted China as an enemy and demonized Muslims as a community. We are fearful that the escalation of both dynamics in 2016 will lead to a continued surge in anti-Chinese and anti-Muslim hate activity, the group stated. Consistent with previous years, transgender women experienced the highest rate of violence. All 18 of these crimes were of a violent nature, as were 84 percent of crimes targeting gay men and lesbians -- the highest percentage since 2003. The over-representation of African Americans as victims of racial hate crimes, the high rates of violence experienced by LGBT victims and the spike in anti-Muslim and Middle Eastern hate crimes at the end of 2015 are reminders that our work is far from over, said commission President Isabelle Gunning. By comparison, 68 percent of racial crimes and only 21 percent of religious crimes involved violence, but the overall rate of violence rose slightly from 2014 and there were three attempted murders last year. This is troubling news that confirms the need to protect our residents of this county who deserve to live free of prejudice, discrimination, harassment and violence, said Hilda Solis, chair of the L.A. County Board of Supervisors. The report found that hate crimes occurred throughout the county, but the largest number of hate crimes took place in the San Fernando Valley, followed by the Metro region that stretches from West Hollywood to Boyle Heights. The highest rate of bias-related crimes occurred in the Metro region, followed by the western part of the county that includes a number of affluent cities. The western region was the site of a large number of anti-Jewish vandalisms. Examples of crimes against the Jewish community include swastikas or Nazi references that evoke a particularly emotional response in the Jewish community. It is disturbing to see this two-year trend of increased anti-Jewish hate crimes, both in LA County and in the state of California, said ADL Pacific Southwest Regional Director Amanda Susskind. We remain deeply concerned that African-Americans continue to be the most frequently targeted victims of hate crimes, she said. Half of reported hate crimes were racially motivated and African Americans were targeted in more than half of these cases, while making up only 8.3 percent of LA Countys population. We are also very troubled about the 47 percent increase in gender- motivated crimes, with 18 of them violent attacks against transgender women. The commissions report was generated from data collected from sheriff and city police departments, school districts and community groups. L.A. County Sheriffs Executive Officer Neal Tyler said that the department has made outreach to all minority communities a priority. Hate crimes victimize each of us in the same way terrorism threatens our peace of mind, even for those not specifically targeted, Tyler said. The LASD will continue our outreach efforts, our trust building, our investigative and enforcement activities, and our hate crime prevention undertakings, such as educating our youth.

520,"- Two Los Angeles police officers involved in the deadly shooting of a mentally ill man in South Los Angeles in 2014 sued the city today, alleging they are being kept from returning to field duty due to racial discrimination and retaliation. Officers Tony Villegas and Sharlton Wampler were both assigned to the Newton Divisions gang unit when they encountered 25-year-old Ezell Ford Jr. on Aug. 11, 2014. A representative for the City Attorneys Office did not immediately return a call for comment on the plaintiffs Los Angeles Superior Court lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages. The suit states that Ford attempted to grab Wamplers firearm and, fearing for his life and that of Villegas, the officer grabbed the backup firearm holstered to his leg and shot Ford, who died at the scene. The chief (Charlie Beck) declared that all aspects of the shooting were within policy. Plaintiffs were cleared by the department, the suit says. However, the Police Commission -- described in the lawsuit as an inexperienced group of political appointees -- overturned the LAPDs findings and found the shooting was out of policy. The officers were temporarily assigned to administrative duties but remain benched today although they committed no misconduct, their suit says. Villegas, who is Latino, has been told he cannot do outside work; Wampler, who is white, has been denied a patrol bonus; and neither officer can be promoted to the rank of sergeant because of their non-field status, their suit says. They have additionally been unable to obtain transfers, overtime and coveted assignments, according to their court papers. In contrast, a black officer who was recently involved in a lethal shooting that was found by the chief and the Police Commission to be out of policy was only taken out of the field for a short time and now has an important position in the Metropolitan Division, the suit says. Clearly, there is a different standard of discipline meted out to officers solely on account of their race and color of their skin, the suit alleges. The treatment of the officers also illustrates the retaliation they suffered after they reported their complaints and said they intended to sue, according to their lawsuit. City News Service",1,0,3
521,"LOS ANGELES --- A YouTube personality and LGBT activist who says he was attacked by three men after leaving a gay bar in West Hollywood is facing a criminal charge of making a false police report. Calum McSwiggan, 26, of London, was scheduled to be arraigned this afternoon on a misdemeanor count of falsely reporting to a peace officer that a felony was committed, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorneys Office. McSwiggan is accused of falsely reporting to police on Monday that he had been beaten by three men, resulting in various injuries. On his Twitter account today, McSwiggan posted, To reiterate, I did not fake this attack and am absolutely appalled that anyone would suggest or think that I did. He posted a longer explanation on his Facebook page in which he wrote that he left The Abbey with a guy he took a liking to, walked no more than five minutes away and blacked out after being punched in the mouth and kicked in the body. I have spent my whole adult life campaigning for LGBT+ equality and did not take this attack lightly, he wrote in his Facebook posting. I cannot say for 100% that this was because I was gay but I cant think of any other justification for this random attack. In a moment of devastation, anger and blind rage I kicked the wing mirror of the attackers car until it broke and then ripped it off with my hands. I also scratched the front of the car with the broken wing mirror before returning back to The Abbey for help. >>>Read Calum McSwiggans statement on his Facebook page.<<< McSwiggan said police apparently didnt believe that he had been attacked and took him to a police station, where he hit himself once with a pay phone across the forehead in a holding cell so he could be taken to a hospital. McSwiggan said he needed six stitches for his self-inflicted head injury, and had suffered three broken teeth, a cut, bruises and scrapes in the alleged attack in West Hollywood. Im heartbroken about the events and these have been the worst few days of my life, he wrote. Many people are trying to discredit my story but this is the full and entire truth. Just because there were no visible marks on my face does not mean I was not attacked. Being accused of being a liar and being called a disgrace to the LGBT+ community, a community Ive dedicated my life to, is more painful than any hate crime could be. McSwiggan could face up to 364 days in county jail if convicted of the charge, according to the District Attorneys Office. --City News Service/Image courtesy of Calum Mcswiggan on his official Facebook page",1,2,0

523,"Today, Sunday, April 29, is the 20th anniversary of the 1992 L.A. Riots, in which neighborhoods across Los Angeles exploded in violence, looting, arson and murder that began in what was then predominantly black South-Central L.A (now named South L.A., a predominantly Latino area). The unrest resulted in part from anger over the acquittal of four Los Angeles police officers—three white and one Latino—who were accused of brutally beating an African-American man, Rodney King, in 1991. According to one of the most reliable estimates, the rioting claimed 53 lives, left thousands injured and reportedly damaged property worth $1 billion. The riots  were widely considered the worst civil unrest in American history. On this anniversary, its worth noting that the city of Los Angeles and surrounding communities have, by most accounts, transformed greatly, owing in part to shifting  demographics, a transformation of the Los Angeles Police Department and economic changes across the region. Heres a sampling of assessments. Please add your own impressions of how things have changed in the last 20 years in the comments below. Nearly 20 years after Los Angeles was shaken by one of the worst outbreaks of civil unrest in U.S. history, residents say the city is safer and relations between its racial and ethnic groups are significantly better than they were in 1992. Most also say L.A. is unlikely to see riots in the coming years like those that swept the city after the 1992 acquittals of four Los Angeles police officers charged in the beating of Rodney G. King, a new report shows. --Los Angeles Times A succession of police chiefs – most notably William Bratton – have made reform a top priority. Eight years of federal oversight helped clean up the department. And the changing demographics of the LAPD – 37 percent white, compared with 59 percent in 1992 – has changed the character of the force, many say.  --Christian Science Monitor The biggest change has been the Los Angeles Police Departments approach to policing in our neighborhoods. The relationship between police and the community is far from perfect. Racial profiling, police brutality and general harassment of young men of color is still a significant problem in South L.A. as it is in South Florida, New York City, Pasadena, etc. ... And the liquor store problem that became such a high-profile and visible target during the riots? While South L.A. still has too many liquor stores there has been a more than 20 percent reduction in alcohol outlets since 1992, thanks mostly to community activism. --Marqueece Harris-Dawson, president and CEO, Community Coalition, blogging on The Huffington Post In many areas where urban blight and hostility between the Los Angeles Police Department and mostly African-American residents contributed to the urban unrest in 1992, businesses and shopping centers have replaced entire corridors once reduced to ashes. --CNN In the 1990s, black residents made up roughly half the population in South Central. Today, Latinos account for about two-thirds of the residents in what is now called South Los Angeles — Central was officially scrubbed from the neighborhoods name by the City Council in 2003. In the 20-some square miles that make up the area, stretching southwest of downtown from the Santa Monica Freeway to the Century Freeway and as far west as Inglewood, there are 80,000 fewer blacks than there were in 1990.  ... The new buildings that have gone up are mostly thanks either to government or to projects financed by nonprofit or church groups. Crime is down as it is throughout the city, but the dropout rates at high schools remain persistently high. Residents complain of a lack of public transportation and healthy food, though they succeeded in shutting down some of the liquor stores. --The New York Times Heres a list of links to other coverage of the 20th annivesary of the Los Angeles Riots.

524,"An auto mechanic who carried out a shooting rampage at his University City apartment complex that left a woman dead and six others wounded was distraught over a breakup and targeted his victims randomly, police said Monday. Peter Raymond Selis, 49, fired a large-caliber handgun into a crowd of birthday party revelers in a pool area at the apartment complex in the 9000 block of Judicial Drive just after 6 p.m. Sunday before being killed by officers, according to San Diego police. A half-dozen of the victims were black and one was Latino, but authorities do not believe the rampage was an ethnicity-based hate crime, San Diego police Chief Shelley Zimmerman said. There is zero information to indicate that race played a factor in this terrible and horrific crime, Zimmerman told news crews during a late- morning briefing. The victims were targeted for no other reason but their mere presence in the vicinity of the (shooting). Four women and three men suffered bullet wounds during the assault. One of the female victims died later in the evening at a hospital. Her name was withheld pending family notification. A fourth man suffered a broken arm fleeing the gunfire. RELATED COVERAGE: Man Opens Fire At La Jolla Apartment Building, Eight Injured: Police WATCH: An Eyewitness Describes The Scene Two of the victims remained in critical but stable condition at hospitals Monday morning, according to police. It was unclear if the assailant knew any of the victims. Investigators have determined that Selis girlfriend had broken up with him several days before, leaving him distraught and depressed, the police chief said. He was sitting in a lounge chair drinking a beer and speaking to his former girlfriend on his cellphone during the shooting spree, Zimmerman said. It is apparent that Selis wanted his ex-girlfriend to listen in as he carried out his rampage, the chief told reporters. When officers arrived, Selis fired in the direction of one of them, prompting three of the personnel to return fire, according to the SDPD. He died at the scene. Selis, who worked at a Ford dealership, was also deeply in debt and had filed for bankruptcy in 2015, according to news reports. One of the shooters neighbors, who requested anonymity, told 10 News that Selis daughters told her alcohol abuse and depression likely played roles in the rampage. They said their father had undergone substance-abuse treatment and attempted suicide several times about a decade ago. One of the victims, 34-year-old Thomas Blea, told reporters during a news conference at Scripps Memorial Hospital La Jolla that he was deeply thankful for the efforts of police and medical personnel in aiding him following the ordeal. Staff here at Scripps is great, Blea told reporters. They welcomed me. They did above and beyond. Everybodys done above and beyond. ... It was a terrible experience that we went through. But Im glad that ... Im all right. Im glad that most of my friends are all right.

He also praised police and fire personnel for their heroic actions in responding to the situation. Truly quick actions, quick responses, the decisions that they made ... absolutely precluded further bloodshed, Faulconer said. It was remarkable teamwork and effort under extraordinary circumstances yesterday. Councilwoman Barbara Bry, who represents the area, thanked the police who responded and the emergency medical personnel who worked through the night to save the gunshot victims.

Administrators at the Executive Drive center contacted San Diego police shortly before 11 a.m. to report receiving the menacing email, SDPD spokesman Billy Hernandez said. Officers went through the complex with bomb-sniffing dogs to make sure no hazards were present. No evacuation was instituted, unlike on the previous occasions when the same crime was committed, Hernandez said. By early afternoon, police had completed their search and deemed the threat unfounded, according to Dan Shapiro, Lawrence Family JCCs director of marketing. It was at least the fourth phony threat made against the local Jewish community center in recent months amid a rash of similar hate crimes across the country.

526,"A 31-year-old man was arrested in St. Louis, Missouri, Friday in connection with at least eight bogus bomb threats made against Jewish Community Centers across the country, including one in La Jolla, as part of a campaign to harass a former girlfriend. Juan Thompson allegedly targeted the Lawrence Family Jewish Community Center on Feb. 20, according to a criminal complaint. The center on Executive Drive received an email at 10:38 p.m. that day that said the ex-girlfriend, whose name was not made public, put a bomb in the center and intended to kill as many Jews asap, among other things, according to the charging document. Thompson is also suspected of making similar threats against other Jewish Community Centers, schools, other organizations that serve the Jewish community and the Anti-Defamation League in the victims name, and in his own name to purport he was being framed. On or around Feb. 1, a Jewish school in Michigan received a bomb threat that claimed Thompson was eager for a Jewish newtown, a reference to Newtown, Connecticut, where 20 children were killed in a school shooting in 2012. Thompsons harassment of the victim allegedly began after the two split up in July 2016. In addition to the bogus bomb threats, Thompson also threatened to make public nude photos of the victim, and alleged she was being sued for spreading a sexually transmitted disease and had possessed child pornography, according to the complaint. Thompson faces a cyberstalking charge, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. Today, we have charged Juan Thompson with allegedly stalking a former romantic interest by, among other things, making bomb threats in her name to Jewish Community Centers and to the Anti-Defamation League, said Preet Bharara, the U.S. Attorney fpr the Southern District of New York. Threats of violence targeting people and places based on religion or race -- whatever the motivation -- are unacceptable, un-American and criminal. Five waves of bogus threats have made against Jewish community centers and day schools in January and February. According to the JCC Association of North America, 100 incidents occurred at 81 locations in 33 states and 2 Canadian provinces. Authorities said that Thompson is suspected in at least eight of the hoaxes. However, he was not believed to been behind the greater rash of threats made in recent months, NBC News reported.

527,"San Diego, CA — For years, San Diego police Officer Christine Garcia was known to her fellow officers as Chris Garcia. In a video published Friday, July 15 — the same day the three-day San Diego LGBT Pride Festival kicked off — Garcia talks about the process of revealing herself as Christine to her peers, a move that makes her the first openly transgender police officer in the city of San Diego. The video marks one year since the 32-year-old traffic accident investigator came out to the department. I was having a really hard time with it, Garcia said. I didnt know of any other transgender officers, and I didnt know that you could be transgender and be a police officer. It was harder telling her fellow officers than it was coming out to her family, she said. She feared losing all respect. She went to Sgt. Dan Meyer, the LGBT liaison for the department. When it was announced, the overwhelming support she received was inspiring. It showed me that I really can be a cop and I can be a transgender and it really is OK.",0,8,5
528,"By TIM MORAN (Patch Staff) A worldwide anti-woman, purportedly pro-rape group was planning to meet at various locations throughout the world on their International Meetup Day this Saturday, but has decided to pull the plug as public scrutiny grows. According to a statement by the groups self-proclaimed leader Roosh V, he decided to cancel the meetings because he could no longer guarantee the safety or privacy of the men who want to attend on February 6. The Return of Kings and Roosh V. have published blogsadvocating for the legalization of rape when off public grounds and have often tweeted about the best ways to trick women into having sex with them. While I cant stop men who want to continue meeting in private groups, there will be no official Return Of Kings meetups, he wrote Wednesday evening. The listing page has been scrubbed of all locations. I apologize to all the supporters who are let down by my decision. An official White House petition to label them a terrorist group has garnered more than 1,000 signatures. There were 13 of the mens rights locations for Saturdays 8 p.m. meeting in California, including: As word of Saturdays meetings spread through various news organizations and on social media, many readers met the announcement with incredulity, and some with pure outrage. Roosh V is Daryush Valizadeh, the writer of a number of books advising men on the best ways to have sex with women. He has been dubbed as the webs most infamous misogynist and says he bases his beliefs on neomasculinity. In one of his most notorious posts, he writes: More from Dublin Patch I thought about this problem and am sure I have the solution: make rape legal if done on private property. I propose that we make the violent taking of a woman not punishable by law when done off public grounds. An odd Q and A on the event webpage– before it was taken down Wednesday night– made it clear women werent allowed to Saturdays meetup, and neither were gay or underage men. A question regarding the possibility of crazy feminists showing up elicited a chilling response. Record them with your camera, upload the footage to Dropbox, and then send it to me at roosh@rooshv.com afterwards so we can tear them up. According to the group meetup page, once all members had congregated near the meetup the host of the gathering was going to lead them to a secret location. The code phrase for group members was said to be Do you know where I can find a pet shop?, at which time another member would say Yes, its right here. Feminist groups planned to show up at the various meetups as part of a counter-protest, according to multiple media reports. Police departments in some Return of Kings targeted cities warned women not to interfere, fearing this may be a ruse for the men to commit rape. A look at the comments below the meetup info on the Return of Kings page made it appear like Roosh indeed has a following. The infamous blogger says he will be at the Washington D.C. meetup during the time. In all, 165 meetings are planned in 43 countries. Three sections of the Return of Kings have been formed, according to the blog: one each in Chicago, D.C. and Poland. – Patch Editor Renee Schiavone contributed to this report.",0,8,5
529,"By KELLY WHEELER City News Service SAN DIEGO (CNS) - A La Mesa man who directed threats at the San Diego and Washington, D.C., offices of the Council on American-Islamic Relations a year ago was sentenced Tuesday to a year in jail and five years probation. John David Weissinger, 54, pleaded guilty last August to a charge of making a criminal threat, with hate crime allegations, and possession of an illegal assault rifle. Its hateful, its caustic, its inflammatory, its dangerous, its illegal, its inexcusable and it cannot be tolerated, Judge Timothy Walsh said of Weissingers behavior. One needs to understand that this type of conduct will not be tolerated, the judge said. His conduct is not going to be treated lightly. Defense attorney Michael Malowney told the judge that Weissinger is a different man today than when he made the threats. In the voicemail and email threats, Weissinger used horrible and evil words and once they went out, he couldnt take them back, the attorney said. Malowney said Weissinger has problems with alcohol, anxiety and depression and had just finished watching a week of Fox News coverage on the Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris when he threatened the CAIR offices. He barks when hes drunk, Malowney told the judge. He was reeling from depression and anxiety. A female employee at CAIRs Kearny Mesa office testified during a preliminary hearing last April that she came to work the morning of Jan. 15, 2015, and listened to a threatening voicemail left by Weissinger. In no way did we deserve the terror that Mr. Weissinger waged on us, the employee, identified as Jane Doe, said in a recorded statement played in court today. Domestic terrorism is unacceptable and must be stopped. The victim said that in the voicemail, Weissinger threatened to shoot her and fellow employees. She said she called police and gave them Weissingers name, which she got from caller ID. The woman testified that she had seen Weissinger hanging around the local CAIR office several times in the weeks before the hate-filled voice message was left. San Diego police Detective Dean Way testified last year that an assault rifle was found during a subsequent search of Weissingers home. The detective said Weissinger admitted leaving the voicemail and also sending a similar threatening email hours later to CAIRs national headquarters in Washington, D.C. He admitted everything, the detective said, testifying that Weissinger told him he was drunk at the time and that it was a stupid thing to do. In the threatening email, Weissinger wrote that he was coming with enough firepower to kill all of you, Way testified. Im grateful its over, said Hanif Mohebi, executive director of San Diegos CAIR office. I want everyone to know that hate messages of any kind are not acceptable, in any way, shape or form.

530,"A man wearing a T-shirt bearing the words Gay Pride was reportedly beaten, stabbed and verbally attacked Monday night on College Grove Drive and San Diego police are investigating it as a hate crime. According to San Diego police Sgt. Michael Tansey, the incident occurred around 8:45 p.m. on Labor Day as the victim, a 40-year-old man whose identity was not disclosed, was walking on the sidewalk near 6300 College Grove in Oak Park, near the entrance to Chollas Lake. The victim told police that as a dark-colored sedan traveling in the opposite direction passed him, its occupants began yelling out derogatory terms about his sexual preference. The car then turned around, stopped near him and out came several male suspects, who started punching and kicking him while continuing to shout insults about his sexuality, the victim told police. The victim was eventually able to escape and use his cellphone to call his parents, but not before he was stabbed in his left forearm, according to Tansey. Paramedics took the victim to Scripps Mercy Hospital, where he was treated for the non- life-threatening stab wound. According to Tansey, detectives with the San Diego Police Departments Southeastern Division are investigating the incident as a stabbing and a hate crime.

533,"Campus police at San Diego State University were on the lookout Friday for a man who assaulted a Muslim student, tearing off her head scarf and threatening her while spewing racist epithets. Police Friday evening released a sketch of the culprit. The suspected hate crime occurred about 1:45 p.m. Thursday in a parking lot off Zura Way, on the eastern side of the campus. The assailant -- described as a thin, black-haired, roughly 5-foot-11- inch white man in his 20s with green or hazel eyes -- pushed and jostled the woman while making menacing and insulting remarks, according to campus police. Carrie Hogan, a detective with the SDSU Police Department, declined to disclose a suspected motive for the crime, citing concerns about compromising the agencys investigation into the incident. The San Diego office of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, however, reported that the assailant apparently battered the woman and pulled off her hijab, or traditional head veil, due to her religion or cultural identity. A CAIR statement released this afternoon said the encounter may be related to the backlash against the American Muslim community since the recent terror attacks in Paris. The attacker, who was wearing jeans, a gray sweater and white shoes, fled to the south, toward another parking area, according to SDSU police. The victim reported no injuries. --City News Service",1,0,0
534,"The Laguna Beach Unified School District must remove a suspension from the record of a student punished for their role in the racist vandalism of a black classmates home, a judge ordered this week. The case revolves around the school districts discipline of five teens who allegedly shouted a racial epithet while throwing a watermelon at a black students home. The parents of a teen facing a three-day suspension is contesting the districts decision and sued to have the record expunged in the meantime contending the mark on their record will hurt college prospects, Los Angeles Times reported. The judge had ordered the suspension to be removed from the 18-year-old students record in October. The school district, planning to appeal, never removed the suspension from the teens record. The school district filed a notice of appeal Monday, but Judge Ronald Bauer told the district during a hearing Thursday to immediately remove the suspension, regardless of the status of its appeal, Mark Rosen, an attorney representing the students family, told Los Angeles Times. Although an appeal typically keeps a judges decision from taking effect, if the delay causes harm, the court can allow the judgement to be imposed. Rosen argued that the suspension on the students record could lessen the studentst chances of being accepted to college while the appeal is pending.

535,"Odds are that another America First rally will be held in Laguna Beach this weekend, even with the event organizers vacillating Facebook messages leaving all unsure whether they are on or off. Laguna Beach police are taking no chances, ramping up staffing just in case, Sgt. Jim Cota said Monday. The last rally at main beach on Aug. 20 drew thousands, and one counter protester was arrested and later pleaded guilty to sucker punching a speaker at the gathering. Richard Daniel Losey, 20, of Lancaster, Ohio, was sentenced to a month in county jail for the attack. The organizer, Johnny Benitez, earlier indicated to police he canceled a Sept. 24 rally, but apparently has changed his mind, according to his most recent Facebook posts inviting his supporters to another gathering on that date at main beach.Another rally was also scheduled for Oct. 22, according to Benitezs Facebook page. The Sept. 24 rally will focus on bringing awareness to Extortion 17 and Benghazi, according to Benitezs Facebook page. These events are demonstrative of a deep state operation behind the shadows at the expense of our servicemen.Benitez could not be immediately reached for comment. Benitez, who lives in South Orange County, previously told City News Service that his past gatherings went off without incident. But the one in August came on the heels of turbulent demonstrations in Charlottesville, Virginia, that drew national attention. Were trying to figure out if hes going to do it or not, Cota said. Were trying to reach out to him, but the phone numbers he used in the past are no longer functional. Police planned to try to pay him a personal visit to see if the rallies are still on so they can plan ahead for security, Cota said. Were still going to heavily staff just in case, Cota said. A month ago, Benitez said he had received threats to his family so he canceled the Sept. 24 rally, but police noticed that his Facebook page indicates he has changed his mind. Laguna Beach residents have combated the Americas First rallies with peaceful rebuttal, including tying ribbons around trees and sign posts. Laguna Beach police advised residents to not attend or engage the last rally, where three were arrested. Using the hashtag #UnityRibbons, they tied ribbons on trees, lampposts, signposts and doors throughout towns across America, not just in Laguna Beach. Dont attend the hate group rally, Kaira Rouda, event organizer, resident and author urged her neighbors. Thats what they want. The local law enforcement strongly urges us to stay away from these hate group gatherings. So dont go. Instead, imagine them, ignored, surrounded by #unityribbons. As Dr. Martin Luther King once said: The time is always right to do what is right. With these simple, powerful steps, you will let everyone know that hate is not welcome here.

536,"Just who were the protesters in Laguna Beach last weekend? Residents were largely absent as people descended upon the city to use the small beach town as a battle ground for free speech. Case in point, an Ohio man was arrested Tuesday for striking another at Sundays Americas First rally. That man is in custody, Wednesday, before he could flee the state, according to Laguna Beach Police Department Sergeant Jim Cota. Protesters against illegal immigration rallied on Sunday along the Laguna Beach shoreline at Main Beach Park where the unprovoked attack happened. The suspect, identified by police as 20-year-old Richard Losey of Lancaster, Ohio, sucker-punched another man who was peacefully speaking with a group of people, Cota said. Losey fled the scene before officers arrived. The attack was caught on video and published on various media and social media sites, Cota said.The victim contacted the Laguna Beach Police Department Monday and reported that he was physically assaulted during the rally by a counter-protester. Detectives were able to quickly identify Losey and make an arrest on Tuesday in Laguna Beach as he was attempting to obtain a bus pass to Ohio, Cota said. Detectives believe Losey was trying to flee the state to avoid criminal prosecution, Cota said. Losey was booked into Orange County Jail with a $50,000 bail for misdemeanor battery with a hate crime enhancement, according to Cota.

537,"What started as a peaceful, organized rally descended into a bit of chaos in Laguna Beach Sunday night, according to officials. Three people were arrested at the end of the Americas First immigration rally due to several small skirmishes that spread out into the roadway. Laguna Beach is a favorite spot to stroll the shops, visit the Pageant of the Masters and sight-see along southern Californias golden coast. When this city was chosen as a rally battle ground for Americas First immigration reform, it became one of the most tense spots in Orange County for the majority of the weekend. Permitted organizers from Americas First and counter-protest groups arrived in Laguna Beach at approximately 3 p.m., according to Laguna Beach Sgt. Jim Cota. Demonstrations were reported as peaceful, however, it might have looked tense to those attempting to pass by on Pacific Coast Highway. Attendees utilized their right to freedom of speech gathering initially on the issue of immigration reform, which was the purpose of the event, according to Americas First organizers. Events in Charlottesville, VA and racism drew more crowds to the event which was the third of its kind in Laguna Beach over the past several weeks. According to those present, the anti-rally protesters crowd was greater at the beginning of the day, carrying signs with slogans from Dr. Martin Luther King, and Choose Love. A plane cruised the coastline during the day, with a banner that followed saying, Hate is Beneath Us. As the night wore on, tensions grew high under the media spotlight as groups verbally sparred with one another. The Laguna Beach Police Department, Laguna Beach Fire Department, Laguna Beach Department of Public Works and allied agencies from multiple Orange County cities were on hand to lend support if needed. Barricades were established to keep a perimeter around rally attendees in advance preparation of the event. At its height, the crowd grew to 2,500 at Main Beach at the end of the night, according to Cota. Three arrests were made, and at 9:30 p.m. an unlawful assembly was called due to the crowds not following police orders and running into the street, Cota said. Protesters with bullhorns and chanting crowds rallied for and against illegal immigration in what was overwhelmingly a peaceful gathering, according to officials. Toward the end of the rally, at approximately 9:30 p.m. there were reports of pushing and shoving, as attendees turned to violence in the street. An NBC4 interview showed protester Samaria Salazar, describing how she was pushed against a television truck and pepper sprayed during the event. They called me a Nazi, and pushed me into a truck, its pretty intense, I got attacked several times, just because I was wearing my Trump shirt, she told reporters at the scene. After the arrests, the crowd dispersed in a peaceful manner according to Cota. The partner agencies who assisted include Orange County Sheriffs Department, California Highway Patrol, Irvine, Huntington Beach, Westminster, Anaheim, Newport Beach, Tustin, Santa Ana, UCI, Seal Beach, Fullerton, Fountain Valley, Orange, Costa Mesa, Garden Grove and San Diego Sheriffs and Police Department. Having appropriate personnel and resources to properly address a rally of this size is what made it successful, Cota said. As always, it is the mission of our police department to allow for freedom of expression afforded through the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, as long as it is done in a peaceful and lawful manner. On Saturday, a group of hundreds of Laguna Beach residents gathered to share what they called Unity Ribbons with the city, leaving their mark for rally goers and making their point of not being present at the Sunday rally. We would like to thank the Laguna Beach community for their continued and unwavering support during the preparation and execution of (Sundays) events, Cota said.

538,"America First supporters are planning a peaceful rally in Laguna Beach Sunday, Aug. 20, the Laguna Beach Police Department said in a recent release. Planned at Main Beach, the rally is said to focus on immigration-related violence and building stronger borders, event organizers said. A peaceful public gathering is the order of the day, according to Laguna Beach Police Department Sgt. Jim Cota. Another group, focused on counter-protesting America First, has also expressed its desire to gather in Laguna Beach at the same time. We know who the counter protesters are, and we are expecting them, Cota said. More than welcome to come and speak their mind. The Laguna Beach Police Department is aware of both events scheduled for Aug. 20 at Main Beach. We routinely monitor any event, rally, demonstration or protest whether planned or unplanned. In preparation of events such as these, we communicate with the event organizer and share our expectations related to the time, place and manner of the event, in an effort to maintain a safe environment for the residents, business owners and visitors in our community, Cota said. While counter-protesters have expressed concern over Facebook that the America First rally will be racial in nature, Cota, who has monitored the previous America First rallies, said that racism was not part of any of the previous three gatherings. The Laguna Beach Police Department and other agencies will take every measure possible to ensure public safety, Cota said. One thing to stress, is that this is not the same group from Charlottesville. On July 30, the America First group rallied at the same site, drawing approximately 100 supporters wearing red, waving American flags, carrying banners and dishing on their reasons for supporting President Trump as well as the necessity to secure the borders, as can be seen in the below video. The live blog from that event showed a peaceful rally where supporters shared their views with all passers-by and beach-goers in the free- speech area of Main Beach. As a reminder, all people have the right of free speech and assembly guaranteed by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, Cota said. This right includes the freedom to express opinions; to hear, express, debate and support various views, no matter how unpopular; and to voice criticism and opposition to such opinions. The Laguna Beach Police Department mission is to preserve human rights and enhance the quality of life through law enforcement and responsive public service, in partnership with the community. The below video shows the full event held from July 30:  The Laguna Beach Police Department ensures that everyones rights to free speech will be met Sunday, Aug. 20, but also that safety is the primary order of the day for all who attend on Sunday.

539,"Relatives of a 22-year-old man killed in a Laguna Niguel bar fight called on prosecutors today to charge the defendant with a hate crime, but the cases prosecutor said it would make it harder to win a guilty verdict. The family of Shayan Mazroei, who was of Iranian descent, are alleging that there is evidence the dispute started when he was insulted with racial epithets. The defendant -- Craig Matthew Tanber -- is a member of a prominent Orange County white supremacist gang who has a conviction for voluntary manslaughter. Mazroei got into an argument with a female friend of Tanbers just after midnight Sept. 8 at Patsys Irish Pub in Laguna Niguel. Its not clear what sparked the conflict, according to Senior Deputy District Attorney Larry Yellin. It started off as people talking in a bar and it got out of hand, which sometimes happens in bars, Yellin said. However, it quickly devolved with her hurling racial insults at the victim and spitting in his face, Yellin alleged. Mazroei, in turn, spit in her face, Yellin said. Tanber, however, wasnt even present when she did racially insult the victim, Yellin said. And even if it could be proven she relayed everything to Tanber later then the prosecutor would still have to prove the defendant killed Mazroei because of his ethnicity, Yellin said. Its not possible for me to make that connection legally, Yellin said. Convicting Tanber of a hate crime would not make much of a difference in his punishment given that the defendant already faces 76 years to life in prison as a third striker, Yellin said. Its legally insignificant, Yellin said. It seems to matter to them and I understand that, but it doesnt mean that I can prove it. With evidence from eyewitnesses and surveillance video, prosecutors believe they have a strong case for murder, but adding a hate crime to the mix might lead to problems gaining a conviction and pose issues later with appeals, Yellin said. If there was enough evidence to indicate a hate crime occurred, It would still be a foolish idea (to prosecute it) because it wouldnt be a strong case and it would compromise the possibility of a verdict, Yellin said. The victims familys attorney, Neama Rahmani, said at a news conference in Irvine today that his office is continuing to investigate the conflict. What I can say is Tanber is a known white supremacist, Rahmani said. He has gang tattoos, so his thoughts on Iranian-Americans are clear. We are still investigating his comments ... and his motivation, but I think its a fair assumption to say that he and his girlfriend do not hold Iranian-Americans in high esteem and in fact (that) may have been a motivation for the murder. A friend of Tanbers apparently said something rude to the victim, prompting a response from him that angered the defendant, Yellin said. Tanber then allegedly punched and stabbed Mazroei twice in the upper chest area, Yellin said. Tanber was friends with the woman at the center of the conflict, but they did not have a romantic relationship, Yellin said. Tanber was free on parole at the time of the conflict. He had been charged with special circumstances murder in the April 4, 2004 beating death of 26-year-old Cory Lamons in Huntington Beach, but he struck a plea bargain with prosecutors after a mistrial was declared when an alternate juror Googled one of the co-defendants and shared the information with other panelists. Tanber pleaded guilty Feb. 2, 2007 to voluntary manslaughter and admitted sentencing enhancements for doing so to benefit a street gang, according to court records. He also pleaded guilty to dissuading a witness by force, street terrorism and assault with a deadly weapon or force likely to produce great bodily injury. Tanber was sentenced to 13 years in prison. Convicted killer Billy Joe Johnson, the accused ringleader who lured Lamons to where he was beaten, was one of the co-defendants in Tanbers case. Johnson is on death row in San Quentin. He was sentenced to death in November 2009, when he told jurors he wanted to go to San Quentin because he would have better amenities there, such as a television set. If Tanber had been convicted of special circumstances murder he would have been sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Tanber is charged with murder with sentencing enhancements for the personal use of a knife and prior strike convictions for the Lamons killing. He also has prior strike convictions for residential burglary in 2001, and is accused of serving a prison term for one year or more and not remaining free for more than five years.

540,"The Laguna Niguel stabbing death of a 22-year-old man is not considered a hate crime despite claims by the victims loved ones that the killing was racially motivated. Craig Matthew Tanber, a 37-year-old member of a prominent Orange County white supremacist gang has been charged with murder in the fatal stabbing of Shayan Mazroei at Patsys Irish Pub in Laguna Niguel on the Sept. 8. At a vigil outside Mazroies home, friends and loved ones lamented the senselessness of the tragedy, calling it an act of racism. It wasnt supposed to happen, Mazroies girlfriend Madelyn Leggard told KTLA. It was a racist act, and this isnt the type of thing that should happen to a 22-year-old kid. George Hansell, who was at Patsys Irish Pub on the night of the stabbing said he heard a friend of Tanber complaining about Mazroie, who often played pool at the pub. The woman said, I dont like that guy. Im like, which guy, and she said That Iranian. I dont want to use the word that she said, Hansell told KTLA. According to investigators, the Tanber and Mazroei went outside to fight over a girl. By all accounts (the victim) was in the wrong place at the wrong time, said Senior Deputy District Attorney Larry Yellin. A friend of Tanbers apparently said something rude to the victim, prompting a response from him that angered the defendant, Yellin said. Tanber then allegedly punched and stabbed Mazroei twice in the upper chest area, Yellin said. Authorities say they have no evidence that race was a factor in the attack despite claims by Mazroies loved ones that he was the victim of racial malice. If evidence surfaced that race was a motive in the stabbing, charges could be amended to include a hate crime, but Right now there is no evidence to support that, said Susan Kang Schroeder, chief of staff at the Orange County District Attorneys Office. Tanber is charged with murder with sentencing enhancements for the personal use of a knife and prior strike convictions. Prior to the stabbing, he was on parole for the April 4, 2004 beating death of 26-year-old Cory Lamons in Huntington Beach.

541,"On Tuesday, a 21-year-old Newport Beach man was ordered to stand trial on a murder charge stemming from the January killing of a former high school classmate, Blaze Bernstein. Prosecutors have deemed that the brutal killing of Blaze Bernstein a hate crime because he was gay. Samuel Lincoln Woodward is due back in court Sept. 17 for arraignment, according to court officials. He is accused in the killing of Blaze Bernstein, a University of Pennsylvania pre-med student whose body was found in a shallow grave in Borrego Park in Lake Forest early in 2018. Wooodward and Bernstein were classmates in High School at the Orange County School of the Arts in Santa Ana and reconnected over social media. We will prove that Woodward Killed Blaze because Blaze was gay, District Attorney Tony Rackauckas said at a press conference in August. The evidence was developed by examining Woodwards cell phone, laptop, social media and other digital evidence revealing the dark side of Woodwards thoughts and intentions. Woodwards attorney, Ed Munoz, previously said he and his clients family were deeply disappointed that the complaint was amended to allege the defendant carried out the killing due to Bernsteins sexual orientation. This is a complex case and the motivations each of the principals brought with them to that fateful meeting are multi-layered and theyre really complicated, so I guess from the narrow or selective view of the evidence this amended filing is not completely shocking, Munoz said on Aug. 2. Woodward has been diagnosed with autism, Munoz said.

The firefighters began spraying the woman with carbon dioxide to remove the bees, but in the process, were both stung. Neither were wearing full gear upon arrival, but raced to aid the woman when they arrived, Bommarito told Patch. All three were transported to Saddleback Hospital, where the woman was in critical condition. The two firefighters were in stable condition. There was no word as to whether the coworker was stung. Two other firefighters who were stung just a few times and each declined a trip to a hospital, Bommarito said. A company that specializes in handling bees was called to the scene to remove an estimated 10 pounds of hives and spray the area, Bommarito said. The hives were completely hidden, Bommarito said. The bee expert estimated 60,000 to 80,000 bees inhabited the hives at the Lake Forest residence. It looks like she opened her trunk right next to the hives, Bommarito said of the victim, who was listed in critical condition but was expected to survive, according to her son. The firefighters, who are being hailed as heroes, both made a selfless decision to think of the victim before giving thought to themselves. They did an excellent job, Bommarito said of the firefighters. I hate to use the cliche that they made a life-or-death decision, but thats just what they did. Hopefully maybe she lives based on what they did. OCFA Photo",0,8,5
543,"An Orange County household was disrupted this week when an Irvine man told a family member his intent and desire to people in the Jewish community, the Orange County District Attorneys Office said in recent release. Nicholas Rose, a 26-year-old Lake Forest resident, made violent threats against the Jewish community, OCDA spokesperson Michelle Van Der Linden said. According to that office, Rose threatened to kill prominent members of the Jewish community, possessed anti-Semitic literature and ammunition. After hearing Roses plan, the unidentified family member contacted the local police. The Orange Police Department investigated the case, and on April 17, found the defendant possessing ammunition for a .22 caliber weapon, anti-Semitic literature, kill lists of prominent Jewish community members, a list of steps titled killing my first Jew and papers referencing at least one church and synagogue in Irvine, and another church near his Lake Forest residence, Van Der Linden said. Orange Police arrested Rose at the scene, according to Van Der Linden. He was charged Thursday with three attempted criminal threats, a violation of civil rights with the sentence enhancement of hate crime. Rose will return to court on April 27 and his bail has been set at $500,000. If maximum sentence is achieved, he will spend six years and six months in state prison. Over 100 residents have commented to the arrest over social media, voicing shock and outrage. Primarily, gratefulness for a family member who was willing to turn their loved one in. The Orange Police Department is grateful for the family member who reported this, a Police Department spokesperson responded, over Facebook.  Orange Police Department Photo",1,0,3
544,"Just days after family and friends gathered to support and honor the murdered Lake Forest resident, University of Pennsylvania student Blaze Bernstein, attorneys have requested a continuance in the case against the man accused of the crime. Defense attorneys say that the next court date for Samuel Lincoln Woodward has been moved to the middle of June, according to a report by NBC News. Defense lawyer Edward Munoz spoke up Friday about Woodwards current state of mind while in jail, saying his client is depressed and feeling remorse for his family, and has been reading the Bible while behind bars. Woodward is currently held on $5 million bail. Bernstein went missing in early January, and his body was found in a shallow grave, stabbed multiple times, just one week from the night of his disappearance. Woodward and Bernstein were acquainted in high school, but the nature of their relationship is unclear. The Orange County District Attorneys Office is investigating whether the murder was a hate crime, as Bernstein was both gay and Jewish. Last week, the family of Blaze Bernstein gathered to celebrate his life and the officers and supporters during the time of the search, asking all to Blaze it Forward and do good on behalf of their loved one. Bernsteins parents -- Gideon and Jeanne -- issued a statement in January noting the possibility the killing may have been a hate crime. Our son was a beautiful, gentle soul who we loved more than anything, the Bernsteins said. We were proud of everything he did and who he was. He had nothing to hide. We are in solidarity with our son and the LGBTQ community. There is still much discovery to be done and if it is determined that this was a hate crime, we will cry not only for our son, but for LGBTQ people everywhere that live in fear or who have been victims of hate crime.

545,"The murder of Blaze Bernstein, the University of Pennsylvania student killed at a Lake Forest park, rocked Orange County in January. 20-year-old Samuel Lincoln Woodward pleaded not guilty Friday to killing a gay former high school classmate whose body was found buried in a shallow grave at a Lake Forest park, and a judge set his bail at $5 million. Woodward had been jailed without bail since his arrest Jan. 12. The usual bail for first-degree murder is $1 million, but Orange County Superior Court Judge Sheila Hanson set Woodwards bail at $5 million, citing in part his attempts to evade surveillance efforts by sheriffs deputies prior to his arrest. The judge also noted Woodward changed his appearance by dying and cutting his hair while he was under surveillance While researching the law to consider whether 19-year-old University of Pennsylvania student Blaze Bernstein was killed because he was gay, prosecutors realized they could not attach a special circumstance allegation to the first-degree murder charge for the Ivy League students accused killer. Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas called it a glaring omission in the law that murder defendants who kill because of animus toward women or homosexuals cannot get the death penalty or life in prison without the possibility of parole. The law does allow for capital punishment for killers motivated by race or religion. Rackauckas said it appeared to him lawmakers intentionally left out other protected classes such as gays and women. If prosecutors find out that Bernstein was killed because of his sexual orientation, then they could file a hate crime allegation against Woodward, which allows a judge to tack on more years in prison if the defendant is convicted. Because Bernstein was stabbed to death, Woodward already faces 26 years to life in prison if found guilty. Rackauckas called the office of Sen. Janet Nguyen, R-Garden Grove, to help amend the law. Nguyens district includes Santa Ana, where the D.A.s office is located, but it does not include Lake Forest where Bernsteins body was discovered in a shallow grave. A message left with state Sen. Patricia Bates, R-Laguna Niguel, who is the state minority leader, was not immediately returned. Sen. John Moorlach, R-Costa Mesa, whose district includes Lake Forest was not immediately available for comment, but Rackauckas chief of staff, Susan Schroeder, said her office doubted he would support a change in the law. Nguyen noted that she recently worked with Rackauckas office on a law to punish anyone who dumps a body. Samuel Lincoln Woodward was the last known person to see Woodward alive. He is accused of fatally stabbing the 19-year-old Bernstein late the night of Jan. 2. Bernsteins remains were found dead one week later in a shallow grave at Borrego Park. Woodward and Bernstein were classmates at the Orange County School of the Arts in Santa Ana and reconnected through the social media platform Snapchat. Bernstein was home from college on winter break when he went missing and was found murdered and buried in a shallow grave one week later. According to Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas, Woodward picked up Bernstein from his parents Lake Forest home about 11 p.m. Jan. 2, and drove him to a shopping center on Portola Parkway in Foothill Ranch. Later, the two went to Borrego Park in Lake Forest, he said. At some point, Woodward stabbed Bernstein multiple times, then buried the body in a dirt perimeter at the park, Rackauckas alleged. The body of Bernstein was discovered after a torrential rain uncovered his remains, his Grandfather disclosed at Blazes candlelight vigil. Rackauckas declined to discuss a possible motive for the killing, but a search warrant affidavit obtained by the Orange County Register has alluded that Bernstein may have tried to kiss Woodward, who responded by killing him in an act of rage. The district attorney conceded that the case remained under investigation, and said prosecutors were reviewing whether the killing could be considered a hate crime. Bernsteins parents -- Gideon and Jeanne -- issued a statement last month noting the possibility the killing may have been a hate crime. Our son was a beautiful, gentle soul who we loved more than anything, the Bernsteins said. We were proud of everything he did and who he was. He had nothing to hide. We are in solidarity with our son and the LGBTQ community. There is still much discovery to be done and if it is determined that this was a hate crime, we will cry not only for our son, but for LGBTQ people everywhere that live in fear or who have been victims of hate crime. In late January, ProPublica, a nonprofit investigative news site, reported that three people who knew Woodward said he was part of the Atomwaffen Division, an armed fascist organization that aims to overthrow the government through guerrilla tactics and terrorism. Atomwaffen Division has been linked to four other murders and a bomb plot over the past eight months, according to ProPublica.

546,"By A.C. Thompson, ProPublica, Ali Winston, special to ProPublica, and Jake Hanrahan, special to ProPublica The California man accused of killing a 19-year-old University of Pennsylvania student earlier this month is an avowed neo-Nazi and a member of one of the most notorious extremist groups in the country, according to three people with knowledge of the mans recent activities. The man, Samuel Woodward, has been charged in Orange County, California, with murdering Blaze Bernstein, who went missing in early January while visiting his family over winter break. Prosecutors allege that Woodward stabbed Bernstein more than 20 times before burying his body in an Orange County park where it was eventually discovered. The two men had attended high school together. Woodward, 20, is set to be arraigned on Feb. 2 and has not yet entered a plea. Orange County prosecutors say they are examining the possibility that the killing was a hate crime — Bernstein was Jewish and openly gay — and some recent news reports have suggested that the alleged killer might hold far-right or even white supremacist political beliefs. Now, three people with detailed knowledge of Woodwards recent past have been able to shed more light on the young mans extremist activities. They said Woodward was a member of the Atomwaffen Division, an armed Fascist group with the ultimate aim of overthrowing the U.S. government through the use of terrorism and guerrilla warfare. The organization, which celebrates Hitler and Charles Manson, has been tied to four other murders and an elaborate bomb plot over the past eight months. Experts who study right-wing extremist movements believe Atomwaffens commitment to violence has made it one of the more dangerous groups to emerge from the new wave of white supremacists. Two of the three people who described Woodwards affiliations are friends of his; the other is a former member of Atomwaffen Division. ProPublicas revelations about Woodwards background add a new element to a murder case that has attracted considerable local and national news coverage. But they also raise fresh concerns about groups like Atomwaffen Division, shadowy outfits of uncertain size that appear capable of genuine harm. ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for their newsletter. Woodward joined the organization in early 2016 and later traveled to Texas to attend Atomwaffen meetings and a three-day training camp, which involved instruction in firearms, hand-to-hand combat, camping and survival skills, the former member said. ProPublica has obtained photographs of Woodward at an outdoor Atomwaffen meeting in the scrubby Texas countryside. One of the photos depicts Woodward and other members making straight-armed Nazi salutes while wearing skull masks. In other pictures, Woodward is unmasked and easily identifiable. The young man is proficient with both handguns and assault rifles, according to one person who participated in the Texas training and watched him shoot. That person also said that Woodward helped organize a number of Atomwaffen members in California. Social media posts and chat logs shared by Woodwards friends show that he openly described himself as a National Socialist or Nazi. He was as anti-Semitic as you can get, according to one acquaintance. ProPublica contacted Orange County prosecutors regarding Woodwards alleged neo-Nazi activities. Michelle Van Der Linden, a spokesperson for the District Attorneys Office, said she couldnt comment directly on the case, but said the investigation is ongoing, with detectives exploring all possible leads. Woodward told police Bernstein had tried to kiss him while they were in the park, according to a sealed affidavit obtained by the Orange County Register. Woodwards defense lawyer, Edward Munoz, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. On Wednesday, Bernsteins parents spoke to reporters about the loss of their son, but said they were not interested in talking about any information they had on the investigation of his death. The Los Angeles Times quoted his mother, Jeanne Pepper Bernstein, as saying she had worried during her sons life that he might be a target -- because he was small, and Jewish, and gay. I was concerned sending him out into the big world, she said. But at some point you have to let go and they leave the nest and fly. I couldnt protect him from everything. Atomwaffen started in 2015 and is estimated to have about 80 members scattered around the country in small cells; the former member said the groups ranks have grown since the lethal and chaotic Unite the Right rally last summer in Charlottesville, Virginia. While many of the new white extremist groups have consciously avoided using Nazi imagery, Atomwaffen has done the opposite. The name can mean Atomic Weapons in German, and the organization embraces Third Reich iconography, including swastikas, the Totenkopf, or deaths head insignia, and SS lightning bolts. The group frequently produces YouTube videos featuring masked Atomwaffen members hiking through the backcountry and firing weapons. Theyve also filmed themselves burning the U.S. Constitution and setting fire to the American flag at an Atomwaffen Doomsday Hatecamp. Atomwaffens biggest inspiration seems to be James Mason, a long-time fascist who belonged to the American Nazi Party and later, during the 1970s, joined a more militant offshoot. During the 1980s, Mason published a newsletter called SIEGE, in which he eschewed political activism in favor of creating a new fascist regime through murder, small lone wolf terror attacks, and all-out war against the government. Mason also struck up a friendship with the late Charles Manson, who has become another hero for Atomwaffen. The organization first gained a measure of national attention in May of last year, when 18-year-old Devon Arthurs, one of Atomwaffens founding members, was charged in state court in Tampa, Florida, with murdering two of his roommates, Andrew Oneschuk, 18, and Jeremy Himmelman, 22. Both victims were Atomwaffen loyalists. The murders allegedly occurred after Arthurs traded Nazism for radical Islam. When police took Arthurs into custody, according to news accounts based on police reports, he claimed he had shot his former comrades because they had taunted him about his Muslim faith and plotted violent attacks to further their fascist agenda. Arthurs told investigators he killed Onsechuk and Himmelman because they want to build a Fourth Reich. While Arthurs initially confessed to the killings, he has pleaded not guilty and the case is ongoing. In early January, a judge ordered a psychiatrist to determine whether Arthurs is mentally competent to stand trial. When law enforcement searched the apartment in Tampa, Florida, where Arthurs and the others lived, they found firearms, a framed photograph of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, rifles, ammunition, and a cooler full of a highly volatile explosive called HMTD. Investigators also discovered radioactive material in the home. The bomb-making material belonged to a fourth roommate, Atomwaffen leader Brandon Russell, a Florida National Guardsman. Arthurs told authorities that Russell had been planning to blow up a nuclear power plant near Miami. Earlier this month Russell pleaded guilty in federal district court in Tampa to illegal possession of explosives and was sentenced to five years in federal prison. Atomwaffen surfaced again in connection with a double homicide in Reston, Virginia, in December 2017. A 17-year-old neo-Nazi allegedly shot to death his girlfriends parents, Buckley Kuhn-Fricker and Scott Fricker, who had urged their daughter to break up with him. The accused, who shot himself as well but survived and remains hospitalized, was charged as a juvenile in state court in Virginia with two counts of homicide. The 17-year-old was a big fan of Atomwaffen and James Mason, according to reporting by the Huffington Post, which examined his social media trail. The former Atomwaffen member in contact with ProPublica said that the teen was more than a fan: He was in direct communication with the group. Their rhetoric is some of the most extreme we have seen, said Joanna Mendelson, a senior researcher at the Anti-Defamation Leagues Center on Extremism. The group, she said, views itself as the radical vanguard of the white supremacist movement, the frontline soldiers of an imminent race war. Photo by Jae C. Hong/Associated Press",1,4,0
547,"Criminal charges were filed in connection with the murder of 19-year-old Lake Forest resident Blaze Bernstein, a University of Pennsylvania student who was found buried one week after he went missing in early January. Samuel Lincoln Woodward, a 20-year-old Newport Beach resident, was charged on Wednesday with murder along with a sentencing enhancement citing the personal use of a deadly weapon. Woodward remained jailed without bail as he waited to be taken to court for an arraignment hearing, when hell be asked to enter a plea. He did make a brief court appearance Wednesday afternoon, but his arraignment on the murder charge was postponed until Feb. 2. He was ordered to remain jailed without bail. Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas stated his opinion that Woodward should not be afforded the privilege of bail. The maximum penalty Woodward faces is 26 years to life in state prison, according to the OCDA. He will have a bail hearing, and we will argue about bail and state our position that he shouldnt get out, Rackauckas told reporters at a Wednesday press conference. In the event that he is, a very tight leash will be kept on him. We are concerned about the (Newport Beach) neighborhood, the families and safety of all concerned. We are going to try and make (the bail) as high as we can under the circumstances. Woodward is under medical observation while in jail, according to media sources, however no further details about that was offered by the OCDAs office. The accusations against Woodward are vast. He and Blaze knew each other from attending Orange County School of the Arts in Santa Ana, though it is unclear if they were good friends or had a previous relationship. Woodward is accused of communicating with Blaze through Snapchat, picking up Blaze at his parents home in Lake Forest at 11 p.m. on Jan. 2, and driving with him to the parking lot of the Portola Parkway shopping center. According to the circumstances of the case, Woodward was significantly taller and weightier than Bernstein. Woodward is accused of murdering Bernstein by stabbing him multiple times and burying him in the dirt perimeter of Borrego Park, according to the charges filed. After an eight day investigation, the shallow grave was uncovered following a deluge, according to Blaze Bernsteins grandfather. At the time of the discovery, officials from the Orange County Sheriffs Department did not reveal the type of injuries Blaze incurred, only that signs of homicide were evident. Woodward is accused of having scratches and dirt on his hands, Rackauckas said. Following the disappearance of Blaze Bernstein, while Woodward was under surveillance by homicide investigators, he was seen cleaning out the car he was using during that time. Rackauckas also mentioned that Woodward returned to the crime scene days after the murder while he was under surveillance, though it is unclear what transpired while Woodward was at the park. A detailed affidavit was released by the Orange County Register last week regarding a search warrant served at the Woodward home, as well as a subsequent Orange County Sheriffs Department interview with Woodward. Rackauckas would not discuss the affidavit, but only revealed that the investigation into Woodwards involvement is ongoing. Questions regarding the type of knife used in the stabbing, the motive for murder and other details of the case were not answered in Wednesdays press conference. We havent completed the investigation, regarding motive, Rackauckas said. We need evidence beyond a reasonable doubt before we begin talking about that. I would like it very much if everyone would respect our privacy and the privacy of the Bernstein family, she told NBC4 outside her home. This is a time of great suffering and we would ask that you would respect that suffering. Thank you very much. Bernsteins parents, Gideon and Jeanne, issued a statement expressing dismay at media reports about the cause of their sons death. The Orange County Register reported Monday — the day of Bernsteins funeral — that he had been stabbed more than 20 times and the killing may have been an act of rage sparked by an alleged attempt by Bernstein to kiss Woodward the night he disappeared. Blaze Bernsteins obituary was posted on Patch, Monday. Our son was a beautiful, gentle soul who we loved more than anything, the Bernsteins said. We were proud of everything he did and who he was. He had nothing to hide. We are in solidarity with our son and the LGBTQ community. There is still much discovery to be done, and if it is determined that this was a hate crime, we will cry not only for our son, but for LGBTQ people everywhere that live in fear or who have been victims of hate crime. Bernstein went missing around 11 p.m. Jan. 2 at Borrego Park in Lake Forest. He was reported missing the next day by his family after he missed a dental appointment and failed to answer telephone calls and text messages. After a week-long search, his body was found Jan. 9 on the outskirts of the park, in a shallow grave. Sheriffs officials said Woodward drove Bernstein to the park the night of Jan. 2. He told investigators that Bernstein wandered into the park and disappeared. Woodward eventually left the park at 1 a.m., telling investigators he drove to a girlfriends house in Tustin, but returned about 3:40 a.m. when Bernstein still had not surfaced, according to a search warrant affidavit obtained by the Orange County Register. In subsequent interviews, however, Woodward was unable to remember the girlfriends name or address, according to the affidavit. Woodward also had scratches and abrasions on his hands, which he attributed to a fight club in which he was involved. He also had dirt under his fingernails, with Woodward saying he had fallen into a mud puddle. Sheriffs officials said DNA evidence tied Woodward to Bernsteins death, although they have not provided any specifics. The Register reported that the DNA was Bernsteins blood found on a sleeping bag in Woodwards possession. Blaze should be back in college right now, going to class, hanging out with friends and dreaming about who he would become, Rackauckas said. This case has been solved by good old fashioned detective work. We have been and will continue to investigate tips, Rackauckas said. We, and the Orange County Sheriffs Department offer our sincerest condolences to the Bernstein family. Unfortunately, there have been many reports and speculations in this case. Our priority is to make sure that Woodward was brought to justice. The Bernstein family is distraught though they are being active in trying to learn all that they can. He was a treasured young man and a son that they loved, Rackauckas said. No additional information about this case will be revealed until after the preliminary hearing, according to the DA. We have a murder, we have a victim, Rackauckas told reporters. We are going to bring charges against this person, and we will bring the maximum charges we can bring on the person who did this.

550,"A 35-year-old Irvine man was scheduled to be arraigned Friday on hate crime charges stemming from a religious slur he allegedly directed at two Muslim women before tossing coins at their vehicle from his car in traffic. Brandon Ricardo Pascual was charged Wednesday with two counts of hate crime with the potential for violent injury. Pascual, who was being held on $50,000 bail, listed his occupation as driver in Orange County Jail records. Pascual was accused of making a religious slur from his car toward two women, one who was wearing a hijab, about 8 p.m., March 1, as they walked out of a Target store at 3750 Barranca Parkway, according to Kim Mohr of the Irvine Police Department. The two alleged victims got in a car and drove away, but Pascual pulled up alongside them moments later as they were stopped at a traffic light at Culver Drive and Alton Parkway, Mohr said. The women heard a clanking sound and soon realized that the same man who insulted them earlier was tossing coins at the car, Mohr alleged. The passenger of the car was struck by one of the coins, but was not hurt, Mohr said. The women got a partial license plate and called police, who managed to track the suspect down with help from surveillance video, prosecutors said. Pascual could face up to three years in prison if convicted at trial. City News Service; Photo courtesy of the Orange County District Attorneys Office",1,3,3
551,"Former police officer Matthew Mole -- who served on the Waite Hill, Willoughby Hills, Beachwood and Mentor-on-the-Lake Police Departments -- was sentenced to two years in prison Monday morning on a charge of sexual battery. Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Judge Nancy McDonnell also made Mole a Tier III Sexual Offender, meaning he will have to register where he lives and works with the local sheriffs office for the rest of his life. Mole, who lives in Mentor, is accused of having an unlawful sexual relationship with a 14-year-old boy from Richmond Heights. He was arrested and charged after the boys mother found Mole in her house in the middle of the night, according to The Plain Dealer. Mole and the boy met on a gay dating site and the boy claimed to be 18. Additionally, a jury could not reach a verdict on a charge of unlawful sexual contact with a minor because they could not decide if Mole knew the boy was younger than 16. However, McDonnell had sole right to decide if Mole was guilty of sexual battery -- after Mole waived his right to a jury trial on that count -- and she found him guilty. The sexual battery conviction does not necessarily mean the relationship with the boy was not consensual. Instead, it means Mole used a position of authority -- in this case, his job as a police officer -- to have sexual relations with a person under his authority.",0,8,5
552,"A man from Willowick who was convicted of murdering a Mentor man in 2006 has been denied a new trial by the 11th Appellate District Court of Appeals. Horace Bo Vinson Jr., 30, was sentenced to 15 years to life in prison for the shooting of Michael Rush. An altercation between the two men began because they were involved with the same woman. Vinsons then-fiancee and the mother of his infant child had become involved with Rush. On the day of the incident, the woman told Vinson she was leaving him for Rush and that someone was coming to pick her up. Then Rush, 42, arrived at Vinsons fathers house and began helping the woman move. Vinson grabbed a gun, loaded it and went to his front door where he called Rush -- who is black -- a racial epithet and told him to get off his lawn. Then Vinson also threw a rock at Rushs car. Vinson told authorities that Rush -- who had spent time in prison for rape, aggravated robbery and drug trafficking convictions -- went to grab a gun from his waistband and dropped it. Then Vinson, fearing for his life, fired four shots at him. However, the only witness said they saw Rush running away with his hands by his sides when he fell to the ground. Meanwhile, Vinson stood in his front lawn holding a smoking gun. This is Vinsons third appeal and second request for a new trial. In his previous appeals, he claimed the trial court prohibited evidence that would have established his claim of self-defense. In his latest appeal. he claims the court did not properly instruct the jury on the elements of self-defense. The appeals court, in a decision written by Judge Mary Jane Trapp, denied Vinsons request on several grounds. First, they said the time limit had expired to request a new trial. Second, the court said a request for a new trial is not the place to raise an issue regarding jury instructions. The issue regarding the propriety of jury instructions could have been raised on direct appeal but it was not, Trapp wrote in the courts decision. Judge Timothy Cannon and Judge Diane Grendell concurred with the judgment.",1,0,0

554,"By Paige Zagranski Miami University journalism student Only 4 percent of Oxfords population is black, but almost 7 percent of the people arrested by Oxford police last year were black, according to Oxford Police Department records. The disparity was even worse in summer. In July, blacks were arrested at a rate nine times higher than whites. Chief John Jones of the OPD denies any racial profiling within his precinct. He says he believes police actually do a better job than society of being objective. They go through extensive training to learn how to leave bias at the door and simply follow the law. The Oxford Police Community Relations and Review Commission is concerned about the number of black arrests, says Miami University professor Amber Franklin, a founding member of the commission, but the issue is not unique to Oxford. Although there is not an explicit and deliberate targeting of a community, it is still problematic if its implicit, Franklin says. The Oxford Police Department tracks the number of arrests and the racial breakdowns of each arrest. The 2016 arrest data was compared to the 2010 census population data for Oxford. Chief Jones says with traffic stops, most of the time the officer has no idea the race of the driver. Franklin, an associate professor of speech pathology, pointed out that many officers seem to have the mentality of no harm, no foul. However, when someone comes from a community that is unfairly perceived as a potential threat Franklin says just the interaction alone can feel like a violation of some kind, especially if there was no need for a stop. Franklin says the commission needs more data to get the bigger picture. The commission asked the OPD to collect data on the number of stops and encounters that lead to warnings rather than arrests or tickets. She believes this will be valuable in explaining why there are more black arrests. The OPD is hoping to update their software and add this data to their reports by 2020, Jones says. Alana Van Gundy-Yoder is an associate professor of justice and community studies on Miamis Hamilton campus. She says without more information it is impossible to tell if the higher rate of arrests for blacks is due to chance or something else. In 2016, the OPD did not receive any complaints of racial profiling or bias.

555,"Solon Police arrested a 35-year-old resident twice in one night. The man went looking for his wife with a bat in his hand, in direct contradiction of earlier orders from police. Read on for more information on that incident and others from the past weeks. Theft, Market District: Loss prevention officers at the grocery store notified police that a known shoplifter had come into the store. The suspect was seen stealing a bottle of Patrol tequila, valued at $54.99. The suspect has a history of shoplifting, especially liquor. A warrant has been issued for Kevin Cherry, 33 of Akron, for theft. Theft, Aurora Road: Employees at Swagelok, 31400 Aurora Rd., told police that a former employee walked into the business and took documents from an office. The employee had been fired previously and gained entry into the building through an unlocked loading dock door. The employee signed a contract regarding restrictions of Swagelok proprietary information when he was fired. Eric Stasiowski, 45 of Medina, was arrested and charged with Trespassing and Theft. Criminal Simulation, Huntington Bank: Lariona Gay, 19, Cleveland, was arrested and charged with criminal simulation on June 10. Gay tried to cash a bogus check for $998.32 at the Huntington Bank in Market District. The check was seemingly remitted by Area Temps. The check and the account the check was written on are fraudulent. Theft, Marcs: Claire Jakosh, 66, Solon, was issued a misdemeanor citation for attempting to remove $14.07 of merchandise from Marcs on June 12. Jakosh hid the merchandise under a store advertisement in her cart. Disorderly Conduct, Cortina Circle: Akshay Singh, 35, Solon, was arrested for disorderly conduct when he refused orders from police to leave his uncles house on June 13. The uncle did not want Singh there and contacted police. Later that day, Singh returned to Cortina Circle, this time looking for his wife. Singh had a bat and went looking for his wife at his uncles address. Singh was again arrested, this time for menacing and trespassing. He is being held pending arraignment.

557,"While a 16-year-old sits behind bars in a Summit County Juvenile detention center for a , his friends are looking for support online. The former  student was charged with attempted murder and complicity to attempted murder by authorities investigating a murder and shooting in Caldwell, OH. One website was developed by the charged teens friend. He helped me through a lot and he doesnt know. For that I owe him a lot. He is a great kid. He such a sweetheart. Yeah he teased me and joked with me to piss me off at times but I could never truly hate him, the charged teens friend said. I made this site for the sole reason that I think [he] is innocent. And I know a few others that agree and they are closer to him than I am. He has had a rough life but I can not see him go to such extremes such as this. I know for a fact that he would only hurt someone is if he knew them and if he was being attacked and he attacked back to protect himself. His friend said the site was created to see what peoples opinions are and to bring the friends and maybe family together. A Facebook page was recently developed with the same intention. (Warning: expletive language is often used on the Facebook page.) Good to see people actually give a damn, the pages creator posted. Support and a good lawyer are the two of the things he needs most. Richard Beasley, 52, of Akron, who the teens mother said was a long-time family friend in a 19 Action News interview, is being investigated for his possible involvement in the Craigslist ad murder scheme as well. Beasley is being held in Summit County Jail for charges related to prostitution and his bond was set for $1 million, according to the Akron Beacon Journal. Noble County Judge John Nau issued a gag order on the case Nov. 18. Editors note: Patch generally does not name juveniles accused of crimes. The Noble County Juvenile Court is seeking to have the alleged delinquent juvenile be tried as an adult, according to a Twinsburg Bulletin story. Deputies in Noble County began investigating a possible robbery and shooting on Nov. 6. A South Carolina man told deputies he was lured to Marietta to meet with two men about an ad on Craigslist seeking a worker to help on a 688-acre cattle ranch. After eating in Marietta, the victim and the two men drove to Caldwell and then to Stock Township. At some point, the victim was told the road was closed and they would have to walk. As they moved through the heavily-wooded area, the victim said he heard a gun being cocked. As he turned, he saw the gun pointed to his head. He managed to deflect the weapon and run. As he ran, he was shot in the arm. More shots followed. For the next seven hours, the man hid until he was able to reach a home and call for help. On Nov. 11, a Boston woman called deputies about her missing twin brother. She believed her brother answered the same Craigslist ad. He had not been seen since Oct. 22 in Parkersburg, WV. Based on the information, deputies returned to the area where the original shooting occurred. On Monday, they found evidence related to the initial shooting. The next day, using cadaver dogs, the body was found in a shallow grave. We believe the attempted murder of victim one and the likely murder of victim two are connected and possibly committed by the same person, said Hannum.",0,8,5
558,"Police are searching for a man that spray painted racial slurs, swastikas, phallic symbols and other offensive language on several homes throughout the city. Officers have released security camera footage of one of the incidents and have asked the public for help in identifying the man. Detective Doug Stroud of Strongsville Police told Patch that despite the painting of racial slurs, none of the victims are believed to be minorities. The incidents occurred late Friday night and early Saturday morning in four parts of the city. It appears the person may have been causing random damage, Stroud said. (To stay up to date on local stories, subscribe to the Patch Strongsville newsletter. As news breaks and the story develops, you will be the first to receive updates from Patch.) Two garages on Old Oak Drive were tagged with racial slurs and phallic symbols. Three homes on Trenton Ave. were tagged. The first two had spray painting on their garages, with offensive language and what appears to be a racial slur. A third home on Trenton had a racial slur and a swastika spray painted on one of its walls. Then the suspect apparently tagged a wall on a Fawn Meadow Lane home with a large phallic symbol. The suspect was wearing a Duramax hoodie and is believed to have used a vehicle to drive to different areas of the city. Stroud noted police have received a few tips on the identity of the spray painter and will be following up on those leads. Anyone with information on the incidents can contact Stroud at 440-580 3241. Stroud added that while police have dealt with other vandalism incidents in recent months, it is not currently known if those are connected with last weeks spray painting spree. Video of the suspect is below. This is at least the second incident of swastikas being spray painted on property in Northeast Ohio in recent months. Two swastikas were painted on the driveway of a Lakewood home in mid-August 2017. A third swastika was spray painted on Belle Avenue in Lakewood.

559,"A shopper at SouthPark Mall told police someone stole clothes she had just purchased from the trunk of her car Nov. 29. But she said she may have accidentally activated the trunk release as she walked into another store, leaving the items open for grabbing. A report said the woman purchased items totalling $47 from a religious store across from the mall, put them in her trunk, then went to Dillards and bought a dress and pair of pants for $104. She put those in the trunk, too, and drove around the mall to get to Macys. When she came out about 3:30 p.m., her merchandise was no longer in the trunk. She said she fears she opened the trunk from her remote key fob. Dog Fight Employees at Petland at SouthPark Mall said they were threatened by customers after they wouldnt let a girl hold a dog Dec. 1. After they told the girl she couldnt pick up a dog because she was underage, someone with her pretended to be her guardian. The girls parents then entered the argument and told an employee she beter watch herself after work. The employee did not seek charges, but said she wanted the family banned from the store. The parents denied making any threats and said they would take their concerns to the corporate offices.

560,"The young man accused of plowing a car into a crowd of people protesting a white supremacist rally was fascinated with Nazism, idolized Adolf Hitler and had been singled out by school officials in the ninth grade for his deeply held, radical convictions on race, a former high school teacher said Sunday. James Alex Fields Jr. also confided that he had been diagnosed with schizophrenia when he was younger and had been prescribed an anti-psychotic medication, Derek Weimer said in an interview with The Associated Press. In high school, Fields was an average student but had a keen interest in military history, Hitler and Nazi Germany, said Weimer, who said he was Fields social studies teacher at Randall K. Cooper high school in Union, Kentucky, in Fields junior and senior years. Once you talked to James for a while, you would start to see that sympathy towards Nazism, that idolization of Hitler, that belief in white supremacy, Weimer said. It would start to creep out. (For updates on this story and more local news, subscribe to the Toledo Patch.) Watch: Man Accused Of Driving Into Protesters Denied Bond Police charged Fields with second-degree murder and other counts for allegedly driving his silver Dodge Challenger through a crowd of protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Saturday, killing a 32-year-old woman and wounding at least 19 other people. A Virginia State Police helicopter deployed in a large-scale police response to the violence then crashed into the woods outside of town and both troopers on board died. The 20-year-old Fields had been photographed hours earlier carrying the emblem of Vanguard America, one of the hate groups that organized the take America back campaign in protest of the removal of a Confederate statue. The group on Sunday denied any association with the suspect, even as a separate hate group that organized Saturdays rally pledged on social media to organize future events that would be bigger than Charlottesville. The mayor of Charlottesville, political leaders of all political stripes and activists and community organizers around the country planned rallies, vigils and education campaigns to combat the hate groups. They also urged President Donald Trump to forcefully denounce the organizations, some of which specifically cited Trumps election after a campaign of racially charged rhetoric as validation of their beliefs. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced late Saturday that federal authorities would pursue a civil rights investigation into the circumstances surrounding the crash. Weimer recalled that school officials had singled out Fields when he was in ninth grade for his political beliefs and deeply held, radical convictions on race and Nazism. It was a known issue, he said. Weimer said Fields left school for a while, and when he came back he was quieter about politics until his senior year, when politicians started to declare their candidacy for the 2016 presidential race. Weimer said Fields was a big Trump supporter because of what he believed to be Trumps views on race. Trumps proposal to build a border wall with Mexico was particularly appealing to Fields, Weimer said. Fields also admired the Confederacy for its military prowess, he said, though they never spoke about slavery. As a senior, Fields wanted to join the army, and Weimer, a former officer in the Ohio National Guard, guided him through the process of applying, he said, believing that the military would expose Fields to people of different races and backgrounds and help him dispel his white supremacist views. But Fields was ultimately turned down, which was a big blow, Weimer said. Weimer said he lost contact with Fields after he graduated and was surprised to hear reports that Fields had enlisted in the army. The Army can confirm that James Alex Fields reported for basic military training in August of 2015, said Army spokeswoman Lt. Col. Jennifer Johnson. He was, however, released from active duty due to a failure to meet training standards in December of 2015. Fields mother, Samantha Bloom, told the AP late Saturday that she knew her son was going to Virginia for a political rally but she had no idea it involved white supremacists. I just told him to be careful, she said, adding she warned him that if there were protests to make sure hes doing it peacefully. I thought it had something to do with Trump. Trumps not a white supremacist, said Bloom, speaking from the condominium in Maumee, Ohio, where she had lived with her son until he moved out a few months ago. In photos taken before the rally, Fields was shown standing Saturday with a half-dozen other men, all wearing the Vanguard America uniform of khakis and white polo shirts. The men held white shields with Vanguard Americas black-and-white logo of two crossed axes. The Confederate statue of Robert E. Lee was in the background. The photo was taken about 10:30 a.m. Saturday just hours before authorities say Fields crashed his car into the crowd at 1:42 p.m. The Anti-Defamation League says Vanguard America believes the U.S. is an exclusively white nation and uses propaganda to recruit young white men online and on college campuses. In a Twitter post, the group said it had handed out the shields to anyone in attendance who wanted them and denied Fields was a member. All our members are safe an (sic) accounted for, with no arrests or charges. In blog posts after the violence, the Daily Stormer, a leading white nationalist website that promoted the Charlottesville event, pledged to hold more events soon. We are going to start doing this nonstop, the post said. We are going to go bigger than Charlottesville. We are going to go huge. Saturdays chaos erupted as neo-Nazis, skinheads, Ku Klux Klan members and other white supremacist groups arrived for the rally. Counter-protesters were also on hand, and the two sides clashed, with people throwing punches, hurling water bottles and unleashing chemical sprays. Officials have not provided a crowd estimate, but it appeared to number well over 1,000. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency, police in riot gear ordered people out of the streets and helicopters circled overhead. Then, as the counter-protesters marched a few blocks from the statue, the Dodge Challenger tore into the crowd, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer as she was crossing the street. Hours later, the helicopter crashed, killing two state police troopers, Lt. H. Jay Cullen, 48, and Berke M.M. Bates, one day shy of his 41st birthday. Trump criticized the violence in a tweet Saturday, followed by a news conference and a call for a swift restoration of law and order. We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, he said. The on many sides ending of his statement drew the ire of his critics, who said he failed to specifically denounce white supremacy and equated those who came to protest racism with the white supremacists. Trump needs to come out stronger against the actions of white supremacists, McAuliffe told reporters at the First Baptist Church in Charlottesville on Sunday. They are Nazis and they are here to hurt American citizens, and he needs to call them out for what they are, no question. ___Associated Press writers Alan Suderman in Richmond, Virginia; Heidi Brown in Charlottesville, Virginia; Claire Galofaro in Louisville, Kentucky; John Seewer in Maumee, Ohio; and AP News Research associate Monika Mathur in New York contributed to this report.

The 33-year-old Luengo was killed Thursday after he allegedly got into a car accident on I-90, attacked Good Samaritans that tried to help him, and then reportedly became aggressive towards a Sheriffs deputy. His interactions with Westlake Police paint the picture of a troubled man. He called Westlake Police on Thursday and said he was a drug dealer and wanted to turn himself in, according to police logs. He then told police that he was being hunted by three witches, was gay and was contemplating suicide. At that time, he was heading east toward Lakewood, and asked for Lakewood Police to get involved. Westlake Police went out to check Luengos residence, according to the log, because they suspected he was in the midst of a possible psychotic episode.

564,"A federal judge in Oklahoma City told a 34-year-old woman with long rap sheet and seven children she should consider getting herself sterilized — and she did in a case that has alarmed civil rights advocates who say the judges unusual suggestion harkens back to a time when sterilization was used to control so-called undesirable populations. Summer Thyme Creel, 34, pleaded guilty to a single count of counterfeiting in January 2017, but Senior U.S. District Judge Stephen P. Friot postponed sentencing several times over the past year because Creel was either in jail or tested positive for crack-cocaine or methamphetamine use, court records show. When she didnt show up for sentencing last June, Friot said in a written order that he would consider it if she chose to have the procedure. In an order setting sentencing dates last summer, Friot wrote that Creel had a series of relationships with various sires over approximately the last 14 years and that, given the birth dates of her seven children, it appears highly likely that some of her children were conceived, carried and born while she was a habitual drug user. In 2012, The Oklahoma Department of Human Services terminated Creels parental rights on six of her seven children — the last was born in 2016 — after an investigation for failure to protect the children from harm, he wrote. At sentencing, he wrote, Ms. Creel may, if (and only if) she chooses to do so, present medical evidence to the court establishing that she has been rendered incapable of procreation. Creel underwent the sterilization procedure in November, The Oklahoman reported. Her court-appointed defense attorney, Brett Behenna, told the newspaper that he spoke in detail with his client about it, but she voluntarily wanted it. Behenna told The Washington Post he was surprised when Friot called him and the prosecutor into his chambers last June and said he was going to include the suggestion in a written order setting sentencing dates. I was surprised, Behenna told The Post. Thats a very serious thing to bring up in the context of a criminal case, and Ive never seen it before. In her sentencing memo, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jessica Perry, who prosecuted the case, urged Friot not to consider Creels sterilization, writing that she has a fundamental constitutional right to procreate and that her decision on whether to have additional children was irrelevant to the facts of the case. On Thursday, Friot sentenced Creel to a year in prison. Perry had recommended a term of six to 12 months. A habitual offender, Creels rap sheet includes multiple convictions for passing bad checks, embezzlement, grand larceny, forgery, obstructing an officer, and false impersonation — all charges handled in state courts. Creel landed in federal court in 2016 in the counterfeiting scheme after she and a friend were indicted on charges they stole bank statements from mailboxes and used the account numbers to create phony checks. Though the judge cited Creels history of drug abuse, Deborah A. Reid, senior health policy attorney for the Legal Action Center, told The Post a substance abuse disorder should be considered a disease, not a character flaw to be used against somebody in sentencing. Courts should never be involved in a persons reproductive choices, she added, and sterilization should never be a consideration in sentencing. Eesha Pandit, a longtime womens rights advocate and managing partner of the Center for Advancing Innovative Policy, told The Post the case harkens to a long legacy of coercive reproductive policies and practices. For decades, Pandit said, sterilization was used as a way to control populations considered undesirable — immigrants, people of color, poor people, those with mental illnesses and disabilities. Tying Ms. Creels sentencing to her sterilization formalizes the coercion — the threat of a harsher sentence is manipulative and dangerous, and aligns with a legacy of eugenic practices through the U.S. Friot was appointed to the federal bench in Oklahomas Western District in 2001 by President George W. Bush. He assumed senior status — a form of semi-retirement — in December 2014. In 2013, he sided with religious conservatives in a ruling exempting four universities from including coverage for contraceptives in their insurance plans, as required at the time by the Affordable Care Act, because they are Christ-centered institutions that believe birth control is sinful. The ruling was overturned by the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver, Colorado. Lynn Paltrow, the founder of the National Advocates for Pregnant Woman and a former senior staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, told The Post the irony is not lost on us that this federal district court judge sided with religious organizations resisting Obamacares mandate to cover contraception but believes it is appropriate to wield his enormous power to punish a woman for procreating. She also said it is highly unlikely that this judge has asked any man how many children he fathered and used that in his sentencing determination. Photo via Shutterstock",0,8,5
565,"Few religious pilgrimages lead down a dusty, unpaved Oklahoma road past grazing horses, metal barns and towering wind turbines in the distance. But the unusual destination of this 2,000-mile trek from Central America to a farmhouse outside a one-stoplight town seems an appropriate honor for the Rev. Stanley Rother, a martyred priest celebrated for his unassuming nature and hard work. Rother was being beatified Saturday at Roman Catholic mass in Oklahoma City, moving him one step closer to possible sainthood. The ceremony drew thousands to a downtown convention center to honor the churchs first U.S.-born martyr and the first priest from the United States to be beatified. Choirs sang hymns in English and Spanish. The church asked parishioners not to save seats as lines wrapped around the outside of the building. Some people were turned away. (For more information on Rothers beatification and other Oklahoma City-area stories, subscribe to Patch to receive daily newsletters and breaking news alerts. If you have an iPhone, click here to get the free Patch iPhone app.) The native of Okarche was a 46-year-old missionary in Guatemala when he was killed in 1981, one of several priests slain during the countrys civil war between a right-wing dictatorship and liberal guerrillas. His name first appeared on a death list, and then he was shot to death in his mission. Pope Francis declared Rother a martyr in December. This is only the second beatification held in the United States.  Juan Pablo Ixbalan made the journey from Guatemala with his fellow parishioners and church leaders to Rothers childhood home. Setting foot in the house where Rother was born moved Ixbalan to tears, he said, and further sealed an inseparable connection. I feel like his brother — that we lived together, that we share the bond of brotherhood, Ixbalan said in Tzutuhil, which is spoken by a subgroup of Mayans, through an interpreter. He became one of us. He learned the language. Ixbalan, 63, was a young teen when he first met Rother at his church in Santiago Atitlan, situated on a lakeshore between two volcanoes in the Guatemalan highlands where he grew up. Rother started a radio station, worked alongside farmers and pushed for locals to make and sell knitted clothing. In helping translate the New Testament, Rother is credited with helping start the written form of Tzutuhil. Language wasnt always Rothers strong suite. Early on in seminary, he got a Cs and Ds, respectively, in Latin and English. Family lore tells that when Rother told his father he was going to become a priest, the elder Rother joked that he shouldnt have avoided Latin in high school. But farm work came with ease, and it served the eldest of the five Rother children well in Guatemala. He helped install an irrigation system and brought in crops such as wheat and soybeans, dissuading farmers from using chemicals. He brought in tractors to till the land, and repaired vehicles when they broke down. Rother was born in 1935, a descendent of German immigrants who homesteaded on the outskirts of Okarche, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) northwest of Oklahoma City. While much of the state remains largely protestant, Okarche — population 1,300 — has held to its Catholic heritage. Its still home to the Holy Trinity Church and school Rother attended. Although the beatification ceremony is in Oklahoma City, its been felt in Rothers hometown. The delegation from Guatemala stopped for lunch at Esichens Bar, which bills itself as Oklahomas oldest bar, but is best known for selling whole fried chickens. Julie Kroeners family has owned the Okarche establishment for five generations. She was a child when Rother died, but she said grew up respecting him and his family. This is a huge deal, and its an amazing thing to experience, Kroene said Friday, just after the lunch rush. It gives you a sense of pride knowing that somebody like that comes from such a simple town. The Archdiocese of Oklahoma City, a sponsor of Rothers mission to Guatemala, opened his cause for beatification in 2007. Pope Francis, the first Latin American head of the church, has said priests killed during the regions right-wing dictatorships died out of hatred for their faith. Regular candidates for beatification need a Vatican-certified miracle attributed to their intercession, but the church makes an exception for martyrs. A miracle is still necessary to be declared a saint. Writer Maria Ruiz Scaperlanda penned a 2015 biography of Rother and helped submit paperwork that could lead to his sainthood. She said Rothers life became extraordinary because of his compassion and ability to help people carry on the everyday activities of life. This guy could fix the tractors. He could work the land, she said. I love that hes from Okarche, Oklahoma. It doesnt get better than that. By ADAM KEALOHA CAUSEY, Associated Press Photo credit: Sue Ogrocki/Associated Press",0,8,5
566,"Former Tulsa police officer Shannon Kepler, who is white, was sentenced on Monday to 15 years in prison for shooting his daughters black boyfriend to death three years ago. Kepler was convicted of first-degree manslaughter last month in the 2014 off-duty shooting death of 19-year-old Jeremey Lake. The verdict followed four trials that spanned nearly a year. Three resulted in hung juries. Tulsa County District Court Judge Sharon Holmes also imposed a $10,000 fine. Before Kepler was sentenced, Lakes father, Carl Morse, addressed the court, his head bowed as if struggling to speak. The last three years of my life have been a living hell, he said, describing his son as a fighter from his premature birth, and saying Lake had devoted his life to helping the homeless and was going to welding school to make something of himself. Morse confessed he woke up Monday wanting to rip (Keplers) head off, but said he knows acting violently toward the ex-officer wont bring his son back. Morse then turned to directly address Kepler, who sat nearby in the jury box with his wrists cuffed and wearing gray-striped jail scrubs. What you did was wrong ... and from now on, you have to pay the consequences of your actions, Morse said. Keplers lawyers, who said they would appeal, insisted the 24-year police veteran was trying to protect his daughter, Lisa, because she had run away from home and was living in a crime-ridden neighborhood. Kepler, who retired from the force after he was charged, testified that Lake was armed and that he shot him in self-defense. Police never found a weapon on Lake or at the scene, and several neighbors testified that they didnt see him with a gun. There also was a racial undercurrent to the trials. Kepler killed Lake days before the fatal shooting of an unarmed black 18-year-old by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, fanned a national debate over the treatment of minorities by law enforcement. A single black juror was seated for each of Keplers four trials, and civil rights activists accused Keplers lawyers of purposely trying to exclude potential black candidates, a charge they denied. Keplers first three juries deadlocked 11-1, 10-2 and 6-6, forcing the judge to declare mistrials. Prosecutors said after the case finally ended with a conviction last month that it took so long because many citizens are reluctant to send a law enforcement officer to prison. Keplers attorney, Richard OCarroll, railed against prosecutors for trying the case four times, saying they wanted to make Kepler a scapegoat for the state because of the racial issues that underpinned the case. Its token injustice, OCarroll said. There would be no way anybody would be tried four times. OCarroll at one point grabbed a sheaf of letters written by Keplers supporters to show the ex-officers impact on the community. Assistant District Attorney Kevin Gray said the case was about achieving justice, no matter how many times Kepler was tried. He said someone we trusted, somebody we armed, trained and sent into our community had violated that trust. Even after a life well-lived, a series of bad choices can put him in the same position as the citizens who served on the jury.

567,"Former Tulsa officer Shannon Kepler, who is white, was convicted Wednesday of first-degree manslaughter in the fourth trial over the killing of his daughters 19-year-old boyfriend, who is black. Despite three previous trials ending with hung juries, Tulsa County District Attorney Steve Kunzweiler said the verdict wasnt a surprise, and he wasnt disappointed that Kepler wasnt convicted of murder. Im just grateful that the jury gave us some finality with this verdict, Kunzweiler said. Jeremey Lake was shot to death in 2014 by Kepler, who was off-duty at the time. Lake had just began dating Keplers then-18-year-old daughter, Lisa. The jury suggested Kepler receive 15 years in prison at his Nov. 20 sentencing. (For more information on Keplers case and other Tulsa stories, subscribe to Patch to receive daily newsletters and breaking news alerts. If you have an iPhone, click here to get the free Patch iPhone app.) Jurors in the previous three trials deadlocked 11-1, 10-2 and 6-6, leading the judge to declare mistrials. Although they couldnt agree on the murder charge, the first jury convicted Kepler of recklessly using his firearm. Kunzweiler said that based on interviews of some of the jurors after the previous trials, he believes some jurors allowed preconceived ideas to influence their verdicts. It was very obvious in some of the hung juries we had, some individuals were not doing their sworn job, to reach a decision based on the evidence presented during the trial, he said without elaborating on the nature of those preconceived ideas. There was a racial undercurrent to the trials. Kepler killed Lake days before the fatal shooting of an unarmed black 18-year-old by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, fanned the debate over the treatment of minorities by law enforcement.

They denied the accusation. Keplers lawyers said the 24-year police veteran was trying to protect his daughter Lisa because she had run away from home and was living in a crime-ridden neighborhood. Attorney Richard OCarroll said Lisa had been in and out of a homeless shelter since her father forbade her from bringing men into the familys house. Kepler, who retired from the force after he was charged, told investigators that Lake was armed and that he had shot him in self-defense, but police didnt find a weapon on Lake or at the scene. At his trial this week, Kepler testified that Lake made a move toward his waistband, leading him to believe he was going for a gun. Hes bringing it, Im bringing it, Kepler said. It was either him or me. Im not going to stand there and get shot. Prosecutors said Kepler first watched his daughter and Lake from his SUV before approaching them on the street. Lakes aunt disputed Keplers self-defense account and has said her nephew was reaching out to shake Keplers hand to introduce himself when Kepler fired. OCarroll didnt reply to phone messages seeking comment on the verdict. In the first three trials, the juries deadlocked 11-1, 10-2 and 6-6, leading the judge to declare mistrials. Although they couldnt agree on the murder charge, the first jury convicted Kepler of recklessly using his firearm.

568,"A Tulsa County sheriff told a former high-ranking sheriffs official to take the hit and resign after a white reserve deputy shot an unarmed black man, a federal lawsuit alleged. Former Tulsa County Sheriffs Maj. Tom Huckeby says then-Sheriff Stanley Glanz issued a veiled threat against Huckebys son, who also worked at the agency, and told the elder Huckeby he should keep that in mind before deciding whether to resign, according to the lawsuit filed Thursday. Volunteer deputy Robert Bates fatally shot Eric Harris in Tulsa two years ago. Bates, who went fishing with Glanz and donated generously to the sheriffs department, said he became muddled and intended to fire a stun gun, not his firearm. (For more local news, click here to sign up for real-time news alerts. If you have an iPhone, click here to get the free Patch iPhone app.)  Worried about racial issues and questions from media outlets in the days that followed, Glanz told Huckeby he needed to take the hit to get the media off our backs, according to the suit, which seeks more than $75,000 in damages. Huckeby also claims Glanz worried about a 2009 internal report that was leaked to reporters by the Harris familys attorneys. The report questioned whether Bates was qualified to be a reserve deputy. Bates, a wealthy insurance executive, had donated thousands of dollars in cash and equipment to the sheriffs office. Questions over whether Bates received special treatment because of his close relationship to Glanz led to a grand jury investigation and Glanzs indictment. Simply put, defendant Glanz and (the sheriffs office) made plaintiff, and others, out to be their scapegoat for the Bates shooting in order to deflect blame from the defendants, the 13-page claim states. Bates was convicted of second-degree manslaughter and sentenced last year to four years in prison. Glanz left the agency after being indicted and was sentenced last year to a one-year suspended term on misdemeanor charges stemming from the indictment, including his refusal to make public the report questioning Bates qualifications. Huckebys attorney, Eric Stall, said Friday that his clients reputation was severely damaged in the law enforcement community, diminishing his chances of finding new work. Its lost retirement, salary, I think he even lost his house over the deal, Stall said. Sheriffs spokeswoman Casey Roebuck declined to comment on the allegations Friday due to the pending lawsuit, and said it involved allegations that occurred under the previous administration. It wasnt immediately clear who was representing Glanz in the latest suit. Huckeby was one of several top-ranking officials who left the agency in the months following the Harris shooting. One of the officials, ex-Maj. Shannon Clark, settled with the county for $150,000 after filing a wrongful termination claim, claiming he was wrongly blamed for leaking the internal report on Bates.

569,"A man facing federal charges in a pipe bomb explosion outside an Air Force recruiting center in Bixby turned to hate after he couldnt complete the training necessary to become a certified electrician in that branch of the military, federal prosecutors said. Benjamin Don Roden, 28, was rejected, out of work and harbored a grudge against the Air Force, authorities said. The decorated former airman also faulted the military branch for preventing him from joining the U.S. Marines and was driven to plant the bomb late Monday at the recruiting center near Tulsa, authorities said. (For more Tulsa news, click here to sign up for real-time news alerts. If you have an iPhone, click here to get the free Patch iPhone app.) He had every intention of becoming an electrician, said acting U.S. Attorney Loretta Radford. When that didnt come to be, thats when he turned to hate. An affidavit filed Wednesday by federal investigators documents Rodens rambling, profanity-laced letters that they say he mailed to superiors, faulting the federal government for using special warfare tactics and spying to attempt to drive these so-called inadequate performers out of the service. In my case, they have also affected my ability to get a job, investigators said Roden wrote. The documents also detail a cryptic Facebook post Roden made a day before the bomb exploded. Federal prosecutors now believe he had slashed the tires and busted the windows of a recruiters car parked at the same center on Sunday. That government vehicle looks beautiful setting outside that office in (sic) tulsa, Roden posted Sunday. That is how I am going to make up for 2 years 7 months without a job and (sic) harrassment. A day later, the pipe bomb exploded, blowing the door off the recruiting center. The building was closed at the time and no one was injured, authorities said. Authorities arrested Roden on Tuesday. A search of his motorcycle and apartment uncovered a bag containing two pipe bombs, bomb-making materials, a chamber-loaded .45 caliber handgun with ammunition, an AR-15 assault-style rifle, more than $3,800 in U.S. currency and an application for a German national visa, according to the affidavit. Roden made his first appearance in federal court Wednesday, acknowledging before U.S. Magistrate Judge Frank H. McCarthy in one-word sentences that he understood the charges against him, which include using an explosive to commit a federal felony, destruction of federal property and malicious damage to federal property by use of explosive. Roden will remain in custody at least until Friday, when McCarthy set a bond hearing. Rodens federal public defender, Whitney R. Mauldin, declined to comment on the case after the hearing. Several messages left at numbers listed for Rodens mother and sister were not immediately returned Wednesday. Radford said the case is still being investigated and plans to submit evidence to a grand jury. FBI agent Jessi Rice had said Tuesday that federal authorities were no longer investigating the pipe bomb as an act of domestic terrorism, and that the blast could have been the work of a disgruntled employee or a prank. But Radford refused to discount any scenario. While we dont believe there is evidence of domestic terrorism, we also dont want to rule out that possibility, Radford said. The charges Roden faces belie what initially appeared to be a successful stint in the Air Force, where he was deployed and received several medals for his service. Oklahoma Air National Guard Capt. Jennifer Proctor said Roden enlisted for Air Force active duty in April 2012 and joined the states air national guard in October 2014. Proctor said Roden had been a senior airman whose job involved fire protection, but that he was discharged from the air national guards Tulsa-based 138th Fighter Wing in April. She did not provide a reason for his discharge. Roden also received several decorations, including the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, Proctor said. The medal is awarded to military members who have deployed overseas in direct service to the war on terror since the Sept. 11 attacks. Roden also received the Air Force Expeditionary Service Ribbon with gold border, with the border signifying that he was in a combat zone, she said.

570,"- Jury selection began under high security Monday in the trial of Tulsa police officer Betty Shelby, accused of the fatal shooting death of Terence Crutcher, with an unusually high 70 prospective jurors in the selection pool. Shelby, 43, is charged with first-degree manslaughter in the Sept. 16 shooting death of Crutcher, an unarmed 40-year-old black man. In addition to the routine security checkpoints, an additional barrier has been established outside District Judge Doug Hammonds courtroom, where the trial is expected to last about two weeks. Fifth Street between the Tulsa County Courthouse and the Tulsa City-County Library also will be closed throughout the trial, police said.    Many black residents are convinced a police video shows the shooting was not justified, and view the trial as a referendum on whether the American legal system is unfair to blacks, according to Tulsa World. A Tulsa Fraternal Order of Police spokesman said the video evidence does not prove the shooting was unjustified.    Police are preparing for any scenario, but protests so far have been peaceful. At the time of the incident, President Obama asked then-Mayor Dewey Bartlett how Tulsa had avoided the rioting that followed similar shootings in other cities. A few groups, Aware Tulsa and Black Lives Matter Tulsa, are asking people on Facebook to show up at the courthouse Monday.     Police Chief Chuck Jordan said he would not discuss details of preparations his department has made except to say, We are prepared for any eventuality.  My expectation is there will be a peaceful and appropriate reaction, regardless of the outcome, he said.    Jordan said that if demonstrations are held, his officers will be prepared to defend the right of the protesters, as we always have in the past.    The prosecution is accusing Shelby of excessive force because he was obeying commands to raise his hands. Shelby claims she was in the right, because Crutcher refused her orders to lie on the ground and appeared to reach inside his SUV for what she thought was a gun.    Shelby could face between four years to life in prison if she is convicted. The incident intensified scrutiny of the use of force by police and allegations of racial bias by law enforcement in the United States. Tulsa Police Photo",1,0,0

Brian Lewinstein, 23, was scheduled to begin his second year at Berkeley Law this fall and to graduate in May 2020, according to law school spokesman Michael Bazeley. Lewinstein crossed a safety fence to take a photograph from above the Toketee Falls in Umpqua National Forest when he slipped and fell down a steep embankment on Sunday afternoon, Douglas County sheriffs officials said. Sheriffs spokesman Sgt. Brad Odell said deputies are continuing to search for Lewinstein today. Sheriffs officials said on Monday that, Some information is circulating that the man (Lewinstein) had been located, but that wasnt true. Sheriffs officials said Lewinsteins next of kin have been notified of his disappearance. Bazeley said Lewinstein worked as an intern in juvenile defense at the East Bay Community Law Center in Berkeley and was planning to intern there again this fall. Lewinstein said on his LinkedIn account that he planned to graduate in May 2020 with a certificate of specialization in Public Interest and Social Justice. He said that during law school, he planned on pursuing interests in racial justice and civil rights law, especially as they relate to police misconduct. Lewinstein said he ultimately envisions himself working in impact litigation or on public policy regarding structural conditions that serve as barriers to success for marginalized youth.

577,"The murder trial of the transgender ex-police officer who is accused of killing his wife is moving closer to closing statements. Closing arguments could happen by the end of the week. Benton is accused of conspiring with two others to kill his wife, Debbie Higbee-Benton. Prosecutors maintain Benton was afraid that she was going to come forward with allegations of domestic violence. On Tuesday, the defense called an inmate to discredit the testimony of a main prosecution witness. Aaron Schafter maintained that Travis Layman - who had testified that Benton had confessed to him - had made up his story. The defense could wrap as early as Wednesday. The prosecution is expected to call at least one rebuttal witness and then closing arguments will happen. THE CRIME It was May 28, 2011, and Debbie Higbee-Benton had not shown up for dinner. Two of her friends who were supposed to meet her called the shop next to Higbee-Bentons Gladstone Beauty Salon. That shop owner called Higbee-Bentons husband, Gladstone Police Sgt. Lynn Edward Benton. Benton went to the salon. Higbee-Benton was in the back. She was dead. A deputy medical examiner who arrived at the scene determined the cause of death to be a heart attack. However, the next day, the autopsy determined that she had been strangled and shot. Her murder was a homicide. Benton is one of three people charged with aggravated murder — a charge that could bring the death penalty. Each will be tried separately. Also charged is Jayson Jaynes, who is scheduled to go on trial next March, and Jaynes mother, Susan Campbell, who was the first arrested and had pleaded guilty to attempted aggravated murder as part of a plea deal that was recently revoked. A trial date for her has not yet been scheduled. Lynn Edward Benton was born a woman named Lynn Irene Benton. As a woman, she started her career in law enforcement working for the Multnomah County Sheriffs Office. She then joined the Gladstone Police Department, went to the Beaverton Police Department before returning to Gladstone in 1990. Benton was promoted to detective and then sergeant. After a failed marriage and then a failed domestic partnership, Benton and Higbee started dating in 2008 and moved in together. They were married in October 2010. In December, Benton started going through gender reassignment over Higbees objections. Benton ended up moving out. A few months later, Campbell would tell police that Benton was in her house with her and her son, and Benton wanted Higbee dead. Jaynes jokingly mentioned a $2,000 fee. Benton said he wouldnt pay more than $5,000. Jaynes said he would not commit murder for less than $20,000. A couple of days after Higbee-Benton was killed, the police tip line got a call from someone who would later say that Susan Campbell had made several incriminating statements related to the murder. This person agreed to meet Campbell and wear a wire. Campbell was caught on tape saying Higbee-Benton had been shot and strangled — facts that had not been made public. While Jaynes would be arrested on other charges, he would not be charged with aggravated murder until May 2014 after another inmate had come forward to say that Jaynes had admitted helping his mom take care of Higbee-Benton because his mom owed Benton a favor. He claimed that Benton had made a rape charge against Jayne go away. Benton, who had been placed on administrative leave after his wifes murder, was fired the following December after city officials found pornography on his work laptop. In July 2012, Campbell agreed to cooperate with prosecutors but told them that I lie all the time. Still, she apparently gave them enough credible information that they were able to obtain an indictment against Benton the following November. He was arrested as he arrived at the bus terminal in Portland where he had been working as a driver for Greyhound. Photo Clackamas County Sheriffs Office",0,8,5

At the same time, he has generally stayed clean and has not been arrested. So, when prosecutors said that they wanted to send him to prison for two years for violating the terms of his probation, Judge Greenlick disagreed. He told Tschaggeny that he needs to understand how close he is to going to prison and he needs to start taking things more seriously.

584,"A Portland State University student was severely beaten and left for dead along a section of train tracks in Truckee, California, last Tuesday in what the students family is calling a hate crime. Amtrak authorities investigating the case have said there is no evidence 22-year-old Aaron Salazars injuries suggest criminal intent, but the mans family believes he was beaten into a coma and burned because he is gay. Salazar was reportedly riding an Amtrak train back to Portland from Denver, Colorado, when he stopped for what should have only been a 10-hour layover during the 31-hour trip. He reportedly told his family over the phone that he planned to explore Sacramento during the layover, but he never made it. A worker at the train station in Truckee reportedly found Salazar lying near the tracks on May 15. Salazar sustained a broken pelvis, severe burns on his thighs, multiple brain injuries, and a damaged brain stem; he hasnt opened his eyes since he was found, according to a May 22 update on the GoFundMe.com page raising money for his medical expenses. Aaron has been trying to open his eyes recently and we are very optimistic, Austin Sailas wrote on GoFundMe.com. Aaron is still healing from the burns, and has been fighting a fever but even still his progress is remarkable. Unfortunately as many know we have been fighting with the AMTRAK department for Answers and at this point we are expecting a very long, and expensive process and are ready to fight. Doctors have apparently told Salazars family that the injuries are consistent with a beating, but no one has officially confirmed thats what happened. The Amtrak investigation is ongoing, and Salazars cousin, Sonia Trujillo, reportedly believes the company has clouded priorities. What Im concerned about is, were dealing with the Amtrak police department on an Amtrak train, Trujillo told RawStory.com. I dont know if theyre trying to protect the train or if theyre trying to protect the people. Salazar reportedly text his grandmother just before the train stopped in Truckee to tell her hed made a friend with whom he planned to explore Sacramento. No other information about that individual is available. Whats more, Salazars family says no money or belongings were taken. So, while the family believes Salazar was beaten, they maintain it must have been a hate crime because he was not robbed. I believe it was something deeper because the burn marks. Why burn somebody?, Trujillo asked RawStory.com. If youre going to hurt somebody, hurt them. But why are you going to burn somebody? A GoFundMe.com account quickly raised the familys initial goal of $5,000, so they increased it to $10,000 to help the family cover expenses — since Salazars parents arent working while they wait for their son to wake up.

585,"A 33-year-old woman shot and killed a transgender woman from Boise, Idaho, directly in front of a social service provider in downtown Portland Monday evening. After the shooting, Sophia Grace Adler remained at the scene with her victim, 28-year-old David Eugene Pierce, who identified as a woman and was known as Gigi. Adler was later taken to Multnomah County Jail following her arrest. She is not eligible for bail. Portland police were dispatched just after 11 p.m. May 21 after receiving reports of an injured person lying on the sidewalk along the Eastside of Southwest Second Avenue, between Southwest Ash and Southwest Ankeny streets, right in front of Home Forward, a social service provider specializing in affordable housing. When police arrived at the scene, officers learned that Adler and Pierce had engaged in some kind of dispute that resulted in Adler firing a gun, striking Pierce. Officers attempted first aid, but emergency responders determined Pierce was dead after they arrived. Remaining at the scene after the shooting, Adler reportedly cooperated with her arrest. Aside from a handful of traffic violations over the past 14 years, Adler has no significant criminal history. Image via Shutterstock",1,2,0
586,"Police arrested 13 people Sunday who attended demonstrations in Berkeley, including a 47-year-old man from Portland. Sean Dougan was the oldest of those arrested over the weekend following a tense right-wing gathering Aug. 27, according to Bay City News reports. Berkeley police say the 13 suspects were arrested on suspicion of various offenses, including assault with a deadly weapon, felony assault and violating the Berkeley Municipal Code. The youngest suspect is a 20-year-old man from Santa Rosa, police said. Most of the suspects arrested are from Berkeley and Oakland. One suspect is from Sparks, Nevada, police said. Police said one officer was injured during an arrest and several other officers were struck with paint. Six people were injured during the demonstrations and were treated by paramedics. Two of those individuals were taken to hospitals for treatment, police said. A rally called No to Marxism took place at Berkeleys Martin Luther King Jr. Civic Center Park. Police estimated that about 4,000 people attended the rally. A separate demonstration called the Rally Against Hate took place a few blocks away at Oxford and Addison streets on the West Crescent lawn on the campus of the University of California at Berkeley. In order to safeguard the demonstrations and public spaces, Berkeley police received assistance and support from various city and county agencies, as well as police agencies from neighboring cities. — Written by Bay City News; (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez); with additional reporting by Travis Loose, Patch News",1,5,0
587,"TriMet murder suspect Jeremy Christian appeared in a Multnomah County courthouse Wednesday morning for arraignment on charges stemming from the May 26 stabbing incident in which two Portland men were killed and another seriously wounded. Entering quietly, Christian stood silent throughout his short court appearance — a far cry from his initial showing, during which he shouted Death to the enemies of America, Leave this country if you hate our freedom, Death to Antifa, and You call it terrorism, I call it patriotism. On June 7, Christian waited until just before he was led out of the courtroom to say — seemingly at surviving TriMet victim Micah Fletcher, who was seated near the front row — Not guilty of anything but protecting myself against violent aggression by Micah Fletcher.  Christians new indictment, filed Tuesday, included additional charges related to an incident on May 25 where Christian reportedly threw a bottle of Gatorade at a woman during a different altercation on a MAX train at the Rose Quarter station. The woman, who is black, reportedly sprayed Christian with a can of mace during the confrontation. For the May 25 incident, Christian was charged with intimidation, assault, unlawful use of a weapon, and menacing. Those charges increase the total to 15, the most severe of which — two counts of aggravated murder — carry a potential death penalty. As previously reported, on May 26 Christian boarded a TriMet train and allegedly began insulting two black teenage girls, one of whom was wearing a hijab. During the altercation, the girls tried to step away from Christian who was quickly confronted by Taliesin Myrddin Namkai-Meche and Fletcher, who Christian shoved just before pulling a knife and concealing it in his hand. As Fletcher regained his balance he shoved Christian in return, who then came back and stabbed Fletcher in the neck. Christian then reportedly stabbed Namkai-Meche before also stabbing another Samaritan intervener, 53-year-old Army veteran and Portland city employee Ricky Best. Best died on the MAX. Namkai-Meche died at hospital. Following his arrest for the murders, Christian reportedly told officers from the backseat of a Portland police cruiser: Christians complete list of charges are as follows: Christians next court appearance is scheduled for July 18.

588,"There will be protests this weekend by both the alt-right and people on the left. Mayor Ted Wheeler says that the federal government rejected his request to withdraw the permit that had been given to an alt-right group of people to have a demonstration on Sunday. The demonstration, organized by Patriot Prayer, is meant as a free speech rally meant to bring back strength and courage to those who believe in freedom, according to organizers. There will be protests and counter-protests this weekend in Portland, Wheeler said Wednesday. We have reached out to the organizers to call upon them to exercise common sense and to help us keep the peace. There will be local and federal law enforcement on the ground to ensure everyone has the right to express their beliefs and to protect everyones safety. I urge everyone participating to reject violence. Our city has seen enough. On Monday, Wheeler had called on organizers to cancel the protest and the federal government to withdraw the permit. Our city is in mourning, our communitys anger is real, and the timing and subject of these events can only exacerbate an already difficult situation, Wheeler said Monday. Our community remains in shock. I am appealing to the organizers of the alt-right demonstrations to cancel the events they have scheduled for June 4th and June 10th, Wheeler continued. I urge them to ask their supporters to stay away from Portland at this difficult time. The mayor said that given the rawness of emotions in the city right now, he would like the federal government to withdraw the permit for the June 4 event and not issue one for June 10. The Oregon chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union says Wheelers approach is a mistake and violates the First Amendment. The government cannot revoke or deny a permit based on the viewpoint of the demonstrators, it said in a statement. Our hearts are broken, but government censorship is not the answer, the chapters legal director, Mat dos Santos, said. We must defend the constitution even when it is uncomfortable. On Wednesday, Wheeler said that as far as he is concerned, this was a safety issue, not a free speech issue. Portland has a proud history of protest, he said. I am a firm supporter of the First Amendment, no matter the views expressed. I believe we had a case to make about the threats to public safety posed by this rally at this place and at this time. My job is to protect the safety of everyone... protesters, counter-protesters, and bystanders alike. CHRISTIAN MAKES FIRST COURT APPEARANCE Think I stab motherf------ in the neck for fun? Oh, yeah, youre right I do. Im a patriot. Those are the words of Jeremy Christian, according to the Multnomah County District Attorneys Office. He spoke those words in the back of a police car after being arrested, according to a probable-cause affidavit filed Tuesday in court, where Christian faces charges of murder, attempted murder, and intimidation. I told him, you aint gonna heal punk, Christian told officers he had told one of his victims. And he still wants to put hands on me. Die bitch...Thats what liberalism gets you. I hope they all die. Im gonna say that on the stand. Im a patriot and I hope everyone I stabbed died. Christian continued in a similar vein during his brief court appearance Tuesday. Free speech or die! he yelled. Get out if you dont like free speech! Death to the enemies of America! You call it terrorism! I call it patriotism! Sitting in the front row of the courtroom as Christian appeared was Micah Fletcher, a 21-year-old student at Portland State University. He was one of three people who stood up to defend two teenagers, one a Muslim wearing a hijab, when Christian started verbally attacking them. He was the only one who survived. The probable cause documents — written by Deputy District Attorney Ryan Lufkin based on video and an investigation led by Detective Michele Michaels — paint a picture of a commute home before the holiday weekend that turned deadly. It was 4:19 Friday afternoon at the Rose Quarter stop of the Green Line MAX train. Christian got on the train headed toward Clackamas Town Center. Already on the train were two black teenagers, one of whom is Muslim and was wearing a hijab, traditional head wear. Soon after, witnesses would tell police, Christian started shouting at the girls. Get the f--- out! he shouted. Pay taxes. Go home, we need Americans here! I dont care if you are ISIS. Free speech or die! Christian can be seen taking large drinks from a bladder-style container of purple liquid that would be identified later as sangria, according to Lufkin. A man — only identified as Mr. Forde — then went up to Christian and tried to get him to calm down. Forde would say Christian spoke of decapitating heads and that the teens were nervous and moved away. Christian can then be seen on video approaching Taliesin Namkai-Meche, a recent graduate of Reed College who was on his way home from his job and an environmental consultant. His girlfriend, with whom he was thinking of starting a family, was waiting for him at the home they had recently bought. He would never arrive. Christian can be seen getting in Namkai-Meches face. Oh, do something, bitch! Christian yells. Fletcher then stands up next to Namkai-Meche. Do something! Christian yells as he shoves Fletcher in the chest. Christian can be seen on video taking a folded knife out of his pocket, concealing the knife in his right hand. Fletcher pushes Christian away, causing him to stumble. Hit me again, Christian tells him as Fletcher keeps telling him to get off the MAX. Christian is then seen swinging his right hand and stabbing Fletcher in the neck. He then turns and stabs Namkai-Meche in the neck as well. He then stabs Namkai-Meche in the neck a second time. Ricky Best, a 23-year-veteran of the Army who was on his way home from his job as a supervisor for the city of Portlands Bureau of Development Services, can be seen moving toward the melee. Christian shoves Best into Namkai-Meche who was sitting in a seat, trying to stop the bleeding from his neck. He then stabs Best. He stabs Namkai-Meche again. Fletcher, clutching his neck in an effort to stop the bleeding, makes it off the train where TriMet passengers run to his aid. Christian grabs his stuff and flees, brandishing the knife at passengers who approach him. He also grabs a bag that had been dropped by the Muslim teen and throws it onto the freeway. Christian is cornered by cops and throws his knife at an officers car. It is recovered. He is placed in the car, which has audio and video recording devices. I just stabbed a bunch of motherf------ in their neck, he says. Just a punk ass bunch of motherf------. Get stabbed in your neck if you hate free speech. Christian then spits. Im tearing out motherf-----s throats, you think I give a f--- who I spit on? he says. I can die in prison a happy man. Im happy now. I can rest easy. Best died at the scene. Namkai-Meche died at the hospital. Fletcher was told by his doctors that the injury missed being fatal by millimeters. Christian, who now has a court-appointed lawyer, will be back for a hearing on June 7.  FLETCHER TALKS After court, Fletcher — who was able to go home Monday night — gave a series of interviews to television stations, professing his desire for the city move forward and heal. We must protect each other, he told KATU. That is the truth, no matter what the consequences. He also downplayed his own heroics, telling KPTV, Im not a hero, nobody special. Im a kid from Portland. MEMORIAL SET FOR RICK JOHN BEST Ricky John Best was a 23-year veteran of the Army who retired in 2012. He ran for Clackamas County Commission in 2014 and has spent the past two years as a supervisor for Portlands Bureau of Development Services. He leaves behind four children: three sons and a daughter, ages 19, 17, 15, and 12. BDSs interim director, Rebecca Esau, has set up a scholarship fund to help the children. Since it was started, the fund has received $13,279 from 129 people. With the loss of their father, it is important that we, his friends, colleagues, and the broader community who are touched by his sacrifice, step in to assist the family in financially supporting the childrens college education, Esau writes on the GoFundMe Page. This fund will be used to help pay for college tuition and expenses for Ricks four children. Bests oldest son told KATU that his dad was always smiling. After serving in the military, he used to say, Hey, Im not getting shot, so why shouldnt I smile? There will be a memorial for him on Monday. NAMKAI-MECHES MOTHER PLEADS WITH TRUMP The mother of the other man murdered while defending the teens is pleading with President Trump to take action against hatred. You have said that you will be president for all Americans, Asha Deliverance, whose son Taliesin Myrddin Namkai Meche was killed on Friday, wrote in an open letter to the president she posted on her Facebook page. So, I ask you Mr. President to take action at this time. Your words and actions are meaningful, here in America and throughout the world. Please encourage all Americans to protect and watch out for one another. Please condemn any acts of violence, which result directly from hate speech & hate groups. I am praying you will use your leadership to do so. Deliverance writes that her son died a hero. He was just 23, a year out of college with a degree in economics, working, had just bought his first home and was thinking about starting a family. Our family grieves, but we are proud that through his selfless action he, along with the other two men, has changed the world, when in the face of hate he did not hesitate to act with love. HELPING THE FAMILIES Meanwhile, fundraising continues for the victims of Fridays incident and their families. The page set up by Portland restaurateur Nick Zukin to help the families of the two men who were killed has now raised $517,260 from 10,100 people. A page set up to help Fletcher, who survived, has raised $242,470 from 7,188 people. A page set up to help the two girls who were the target of the vitriol that inspired three men to intervene has raised $36,930 from 1,127 people. And a page set up by the Muslim community to help the families of the three stabbing victims has raised $503,621 from 9,777 people.

589,"Three men were stabbed Friday, two of them fatally, as they tried to de-escalate a situation involving a man who was yelling racial slurs at two young, apparently Muslim, women, police said. Jeremy Joseph Christian, 35, has been arrested and charged with two counts of murder, one count of attempted murder and other crimes. Christian is being held at the Multnomah County Jail without bail. Hes accused of stabbing three men, killing two of them. He is also charged with intimidation under the Oregon hate crime statute. The deadly stabbings took place on Friday, the start of the Muslim month of fasting known as Ramadan. Just after 4 p.m. on Friday, according to witnesses, a man on an eastbound MAX train was ranting and screaming hate speech directed at a variety of ethnicities and religions. The man, identified as Christian, turned his vitriol toward two young women - one of whom was wearing a hijab - and people tried to intervene and get the man to calm down, police said. He then turned on three of them, stabbing them repeatedly, police said. THE INCIDENT Dyjuana Hudson tells Patch the young women were her daughter Destinee who is 16 and a friend of hers, a 17-year-old who is Muslim and wearing a hijab. This random white guy sits down and he starts talking and ranting about how he feels that Christians should die and Muslims should die, she says. He comes running up on them and two guys stood up for them. To know that those guys put their lives on the line for my girls is really sickening, Hudson says. Christian stabbed each of the men in the neck. Hudson says her daughter and her friend were coming home from school when the attack happened. Once the train stopped, they ran - so quickly that they left their purses on the train - and called her, telling her, though sobs, what had happened. She raced to the station and they called police. She says her daughter is not doing well, knowing that two men gave their lives to protect her. It is a lot for her, says Hudson. THE ARREST  As the train pulled into the Hollywood Transit Center, Christian fled toward Providence Hospital but was quickly apprehended. The arrest was captured on video by Larry Blackwood, who had been on the train and gave chase to help make sure Christian did not get away. He posted it to his Facebook page. Watch the video but CAUTION - there is graphic language. THE GOOD SAMARITANS One of the good Samaritans died at the scene and another died at the hospital. The third man is expected to survive. Police identified those who were killed as 23-year-old Taelisin Myrddin Namkai-Meche of Southeast Portland and 53-year-old Ricky John Best of Happy Valley. Also stabbed was 21-year-old Micah David Cole Fletcher of Southeast Portland. He remains in the hospital being treated for what are believed to be non-life threatening injuries. REED GRADUATE Namkai-Meches mother praised her son. He was a hero and will remain a hero on the other side of the veil, says Asha Deliverance. Shining bright star I love you forever. Nankai-Meche graduated from Reed College last year with a degree in economics. He was working for the Cadmus Group, a technology and consulting company based in Massachusetts. He worked on environmental consulting. Reed College released a statement calling the incident shocking and horrific and offering memories of Nankai-Meche. I remember where he sat in conference and the types of probing, intelligent questions I could anticipate him asking, said Professor Kambiz GhaneaBassiri. He was thoughtful, smart, humble, inquisitive, and compassionate. Now he is a hero to me. Hudson said she reached out to Deliverance offering thanks and saying that if she needed anything to reach out. He died at the hospital. AN ARMY VETERAN The other person killed - Ricky Best - is a 23-year veteran of the U.S. Army who retired in 2012 as a sergeant. He then went to work for the city of Portland and has been a supervisor with the Bureau of Development Services. He was on his way home to Happy Valley after work. He died on the train as Christian fled the scene. Best, who has four children, ran for Clackamas County Commission in 2014. He provided distinguished services to the residents of Portland, said Mayor Wheeler. City Commissioner Chloe Eudaly said that the citys human resources department wil make sure there are counselors available for BDS employees when they return to work on Tuesday. My heart goes out to the family of Rick Best, Eudaly said. They have lost a husband and a father, and we have lost a treasured employee. As a veteran, he served our country with honor and distinction. He stood up for two young women and others he didnt even know - all because he wanted to help. THE POET Micah David-Cole Fletcher, 21, is the third stabbing victim. He is expected to survive. Fletcher - who was on his way to his job at a pizza place - is a student at Portland State University and graduated from Madison High School. He was stabbed in the neck with such force that his jaw was broken and there were pieces of bone in his throat. He is expected to recover. In 2013, he won first place in the annual Verselandia poetry slam contest. One of his poems is about the discrimination that Muslims face. You can watch video of him at Verselandia below. He performs twice - at 2:03 and at 2:32. HELP FOR THE FAMILIES Portland restaurant owner Nick Zukin - of Mi Mero Mole and Kenny and Zukes - has started a GoFundMe page to help the families of the heroes. They are heroes, yet their families are not only going to be faced with the pain of losing people they love, but with financial hardships from their passings, says Zukin. Hopefully the goal is just a starting point. They will certainly need more than this. And no amount of money will ever lessen their heartbreak. In 24 hours, the campaign had raised $201,210 from 4,270 people. A campaign has also been set up to help Fletcher pay his medical bills. In 22 hours, 2,082 people had contributed $70,259. Meanwhile, a separate campaign has been started to raise money for the two teens who were the target of Christians vitriol. FBI ASSISTANCE The FBIs Portland Office said its helping the Portland Police with the investigation. Portland Police is the lead investigative agency and we are honored to support their investigation in any way we can, said Loren Cannon, special agent-in-charge of the FBIs Portland office. Its too early to say whether last nights violence was an act of domestic terrorism or a federal hate crime. However, in the coming days, the FBI, PPB and the prosecutors will work together to share information, leverage resources and make determinations about future criminal charges. We wont allow these acts to go unanswered. THE SUSPECT Christian is expected to appear in court on Tuesday. He has a criminal record that includes felony convictions for robbery and kidnapping. In November 2002, he was convicted of robbery, kidnapping, and carrying or using a dangerous weapon.  The charges stemmed from an incident in May of that year in which he robbed a market in North Portland, handcuffing the owner and stealing cash. Christian was shot in the cheek by an officer as he fled. The Portland Mercurys Doug Brown, who closely tracks the white supremacist movement in the region, reports that Christian is a known right wing extremist and white supremacist who showed up at a free speech march last month with a baseball bat and tried to assault left wing protesters. Brown reports that he yelled racial slurs and frequently gave the Nazi salute. Christian was captured on video doing just that by reporter Mike Bivins. As Brown first pointed out, Christian writes posts on his Facebook page that include anti-Semitic and other comments. He has also praised Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh as a patriot, threatened violence against people, and declared, I AM TROUBLE. In another post with the hashtag #BalkanizetheUSA, he advocated for the Pacific Northwest to be made into a Whites-only homeland. So, its like this. If you support Israel for Zionist homeland for Jews then you should also support Cascadia as a White homeland for whites only racists, Alabama and Mississippi for Nation of Islam and racist Black Power groups and give back at least so cal [Southern California] to Mexicans for all the illegal Latinos and any Brown racist peeps, he wrote. Christian is listed as living in North Portland in a home owned by his parents. CITY LEADERS REACT Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler had been on the inaugural flight from Portland to London when the attack happened. Once he arrived in London, he boarded the next flight back. Wheeler then joined other city leaders and law enforcement officials for an afternoon press conference. They were attacked because they did the right thing, Wheeler said. Their actions were brave and selfless and should serve as an example and inspiration to us all. They are heroes. U.S. Attorney Billy Williams vowed There is a day of reckoning coming. There will be a day of accountability. The Council on American-Islamic Relations is asking President Trump to denounce the attack. President Trump must speak out personally against the rising tide of Islamophobia and other forms of bigotry and racism in our nation that he has provoked through his numerous statements, policies and appointments that have negatively impacted minority communities, said CAIR National Executive Director Nihad Awad. Only a strong statement from the nations leader will send a message to bigots that such acts of violence targeting racial, ethnic or religious minorities are unacceptable. Patch has reached out four times to the White House for comment but has yet to receive a response. Brian Bendis, who works for Marvel Comics and lives in Portland, a few blocks from where the incident happened, said that the next issue of Spider-man will be dedicated to Best and Nankai-Meche. TriMet General Manager Neil McFarlane also released a statement praising the men. These men are true heroes for coming together to the defense of strangers, he said. In this anguishing time, lets come together with a renewed pledge to respect and care for one another as we know we should. Portland Fire and Rescue, meanwhile, tweeted out a simple message. THOUSANDS TURN OUT FOR VIGIL Your sons were champions of justice, Senator Jeff Merkely said to the mothers who lost sons on Friday. Hundreds showed up - from an Army veteran who spoke of losing a brother in reference to Best to relatives of those killed - to honor those who were stabbed and to call for unity, to argue that the response of the good Samaritans is more representative of Portland than the racist vitriol that led to them trying to intervene. The crowd was silent as Namkai-Meches family spoke. His mother said her son had a heart as big as the world. We taught him to love everyone and thats what we should all be doing and thats what we should all be doing and thats why were all here, so give it up for love. His sister spoke of how he loved his new job and his girlfriend and how they wanted to make babies and start a family. At one point, things took a nasty turn. A speaker started attacking Mayor Wheeler, claiming hes not done enough to stop fascism. That led to screams and curses directed toward Wheeler. At which he point, he left the area where the speakers were and moved to a different section. THE INVESTIGATION CONTINUES Multnomah County District Attorney Rod Underhill and U.S. Attorney for Oregon Billy Williams joined Portland Police Chief Michael Marshman at the afternoon press conference. None wanted to go into detail about the investigation but all stressed the ultimate decision about whether it will be a federal or state case will be decided based on what the strongest possible outcome is. A county grand jury is expected to start hearing evidence in the case by next Friday. Have you been a victim to or have witnessed a hate crime? Tell your story here.

590,"Two people were stabbed to death aboard a MAX train in Portland Friday night after they tried to intervene when a man began yelling slurs at two Muslim women. A third person was stabbed, but survived. The suspect, Joseph Christian, 35, of North Portland, was arrested shortly after the incident near Providence Portland Medical Center, according to Portland police. Preliminary information indicates that the suspect was on the MAX train yelling various remarks that would best be characterized as hate speech toward a variety of ethnicities and religions, Portland police said in a statement. At least two of the victims attempted to intervene with the suspect and calm him down. The suspect attacked the men, stabbing three, before leaving the train.  A witness - 38-year-old Evelin Hernandez of Clackamas - told the Oregonian that the suspect began making racist comments toward the women, and when some passengers tried to quiet him down, he stabbed them. The two women who were the subject of the insults left the scene after the stabbing, according to the Oregonian. The incident happened at the Northeast 42nd Avenue MAX stop around 4:30 p.m. The Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim civil rights group, on Friday night called for President Donald Trump to condemn the killings. CAIR calls on President Trump to speak out personally against rising bigotry and acts of racial violence in America targeting Muslims and other minority groups after two people were stabbed to death in Oregon when they reportedly tried to intervene as a man yelled racist and Islamophobic slurs at two young Muslim women, one of whom wore an Islamic head scarf, or hijab, the group wrote in a statement.

591,"A permitted May Day rally and march turned into a riot Monday afternoon in downtown Portland, resulting in the arrest of 25 people, according to Portland police. The march –– which began at Shemanski Park shortly after 3 p.m. and included families with children and religious groups –– quickly devolved as masked so-called anarchists hurled rocks through businesses windows, lit a fire in the street using newsstands and wooden pallets, and threw full cans of Pepsi, metal pellets, and at least one Molotov Cocktail at Portland officers, police said Monday. Prior to the march beginning officers collected homemade shields and other weapon-like items from demonstrators as they arrived to Shemanski Park. Im very proud of the professionalism of Portland Police officers, Portland Firefighters and the members of the other law enforcement agencies that worked to keep the peace in Downtown Portland under very difficult circumstances, Portland Police Chief Mike Marshman said in a statement. Unfortunately, the actions of the law breakers undermined and covered up the message of the law-abiding individuals who worked to peacefully get their message heard on May Day. Portland officials revoked the march permit around 4:30 p.m. and declared the event a riot around 5 p.m., as the citys Rapid Response Team deployed into the downtown area to control the chaos.  Various fires were set in the street and in garbage cans, a police car was spray-painted and vandalized, and there were attempts to set at least one business on fire, police said in a statement. Numerous projectiles were thrown at or launched at police and firefighters including rocks, bottles, ball bearings, fireworks, smoke bombs, and road flares.   One police cruiser was heavily damaged, with multiple videos from the scene revealing a handful of masked men smashing the cruisers windows and tossing a burning flare into the vehicles back end. And a Portland Fire & Rescue paramedic was hit with a can of Pepsi.  Police responded with limited deployments of less lethal munitions, officials said. Across social media, users accused the marchers, the media, the police, and the masked anti-fascist demonstrators for the riots escalation. A KOIN News vehicle was also reportedly graffitied. In the end, 25 people (including three minors) were arrested and charged (mostly) with second degree disorderly conduct. The three minors were arrested for riot, according to police, and released to their parents.

598,"Allegheny County Chief of Emergency Services Alvin Henderson Jr. and Allegheny County police Superintendent Charles Moffatt urge residents to continue to remain vigilant in their communities, and if they see something, say something. With efforts by the Pennsylvania State police, residents can now send something, too. With the recent explosions in Boston, we are reminded once again that we must remain vigilant and aware of what is going on around us in our communities, Henderson said. Federal, state and local officials continue to work together with first responders and the private sector to protect our communities, but the residents are really our eyes and ears. While many reports are for harmless items that were left behind or forgotten, Superintendent Moffatt said that that might not always be the case and that relaying the information is easier now than ever before. The PA State Police have launched a new smartphone application that allows a person to take a photograph or send a note about suspicious activity that they have seen, which then goes directly to the Pennsylvania Criminal Intelligence Center for evaluation and assignment to an investigator, as appropriate, he said. Both officials reminded residents that factors such as race, ethnicity, national origin or religious affiliation alone are not suspicious activity. The public should report suspicious behavior and situations rather than beliefs, thoughts, ideas, expressions, association or speech unrelated to criminal activity. There has been an increase in reports since the most recent Boston Marathon. For comparison, there were 186 incidents of suspicious activity reported in the week prior to the marathon (April 7-13) and 311 incidents reported during the week of/following (April 14-20). Chief Henderson said that is neither unusual nor a negative as officials would rather be safe and check into any reports when they are received. Moffatt agrees. One report can make a difference, he said. We investigate all criminal activity and provide assistance to our local police departments and criminal justice agencies. Without the cooperation of residents—and their awareness—our job becomes even more difficult. If you see something, you should say something.

599,"A new smartphone application has been developed to help the Pennsylvania State police receive reports regarding suspicious activity that may be linked to terrorism. The new See Something, Send Something app—DOWNLOAD HERE—allows suspicious activity to be captured as a photo or a written note and sent to the Pennsylvania Criminal Intelligence Center (PaCIC). This app provides concerned citizens with an effective communications and reporting tool, State police Commissioner Frank Noonan said. The See Something, Send Something mobile app, developed by My Mobile Witness, sends terrorism-related tips directly to PaCIC where tips are evaluated by analysts and assigned for investigation as warranted, Noonan said. The application, which is available at no cost for iPhone and Android phone users, also includes information on what to look for and when to report suspicious activity, along with how to receive important alerts. No one knows what goes on in your neighborhood better than you, Noonan said. You may see or hear things that seem out of the ordinary and raise your suspicions. If you see something suspicious taking place, report it. One tip from an alert citizen can prove valuable and protect Pennsylvania from a potential terrorist act, Noonan said. My Mobile Witness uses patent-pending privacy protection software for safeguarding the integrity of tips and citizens personal information. The system allows the PaCIC to engage citizens without tracking location or storing of personal information. Submitted tips are immediately removed from the mobile device and purged from the My Mobile Witness system once delivered to the intelligence center for analysis. Factors such as race, ethnicity, national origin or religious affiliation alone are not suspicious activity. For that reason, the public should report only suspicious behavior and situations (e.g., an unattended backpack or briefcase in a public place) rather than beliefs, thoughts, ideas, expressions, associations or speech unrelated to terrorism or other criminal activity. Only reports that document behavior reasonably indicative of criminal activity related to terrorism will be shared with local, state and federal partners. Prevention is everyones responsibility, Noonan said. We are one neighborhood, one state, one nation, and it is the responsibility of all to remain vigilant and to report suspicious behavior. One report can make a difference. In addition to the new mobile app, people can call the state polices toll-free Terrorism Tip Line at 1-888-292-1919 or email tips@pa.gov to report suspicious individuals or activity.

600,"A 25-year-old Irvine man was sentenced Wednesday after being charged in a racially motivated attack from March of 2016. Christopher Qu, who has been behind bars since his arrest in March 30, 2016, was immediately placed on three years of formal probation. He was released from Central Mens Jail, Thursday. Qus charges stemmed from the racially charged attack on a black teen and his older brother. However, the plea bargain keeps the 25-year-old Irvine man off the streets and in the custody of the Public Guardians Office to receive mental health treatment. The bottom line is both the district attorney and the defense and court all worked together in order to make sure that the public was protected and that Mr. Qu received the mental health treatment that he needs, Qus attorney, Lee Blumen, said. The Public Guardians Office evaluated him and found that he qualified to be placed on an involuntary conservatorship and receive inpatient treatment. Qu pleaded guilty to assault with a deadly weapon, a felony, and a misdemeanor hate crime, according to court records. A count of assault with force likely to produce great bodily injury with sentencing enhancements for a hate crime were dismissed as part of the plea deal. Qu approached a 16-year-old student at just before 1 p.m., March 30, 2016, at Irvine High School while the teen was waiting for a ride from his brother, according to Irvine police. A pipe-wielding Qu spewed racial slurs at the boy, who was on campus for sports practice while the school was on spring break, and was advancing on the teen when his 24-year-old sibling drove up, police said. Qu banged the pipe against several railings as he advanced on the teen, according to the Orange County District Attorneys Office. The brother got out of the car in time to intervene, but Qu head-butted the man and slammed the pipe against his arm several times. The victim sustained a broken nose and bruises on his arms, prosecutors said. His brother was unhurt. City News Service contributed to this report. Irvine Police Photo",1,0,0
601,"A Jewish community center in Irvine was threatened on Monday, when a person phoned in a bomb threat and prompted an evacuation of 1,000 people. As of this report, it is unclear if this is part of a larger threat made to Jewish community centers and schools across the U.S. Authorities Tuesday are trying to find the person who phoned in a bomb threat, and determine whether it is tied to the threats across the country. On Monday, the staff at the Merage Jewish Community Center of Orange County at 1 Federation Way evacuated the facility following the telephoned threat. The neighboring Tarbut VTorah Community Day School, which is located on the same property, was also evacuated just before 4:45 p.m. Monday.No one was hurt in the incident. Orange County Sheriffs Department bomb-sniffing dogs were called in to perform a search of the location and nothing suspicious was found, Kim Mohr of the Irvine Police Department said. There have been reports ... of threats called in to Jewish community centers and schools across the country, Mohr said. It is unclear at this time whether the threat in Irvine is tied to any other such threat. About 20 threats were made on Monday to Jewish institutions across the country, including the Westside Jewish Community Center in Los Angeles and another JCC in La Jolla, according to the Anti-Defamation League. The Newport Beach Temple Bat Yahm responded to recent events in a statement, Temple Bat Yahm leaders Stan Levy with Rabbi Gersh Zylberman discussed recent bomb threats to Jewish community centers across the country. Over the last several years we have been implementing important security measures – both physical and procedural - to help maintain safety for all who visit our campus, Levy said in a statement released to members of the Temple. Of course, we are particularly mindful of our responsibility in protecting the children entrusted to our care every day. About 90 bomb threats have been made since the beginning of the year, and a number of Jewish cemeteries have been vandalized. About 20 threats were made on Monday to Jewish institutions across the country, according to the Anti-Defamation League. About 90 bomb threats have been made since the beginning of the year, and a number of Jewish cemeteries have been vandalized. Rusty Kennedy, chief executive of the OC Human Relations Commission, said the rash of bigoted incidents that has erupted since the presidential election was the highest number since the six weeks following the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. The commission has documented 44 hate incidents and 15 actual hate crimes in Orange County since Donald Trump was elected president in November, Kennedy said. Theres everything from elementary school kids taunting their custodian, who is Latino, with a chant, Build a wall, to a Muslim woman who had a man come up from behind her and yank her hijab off and punch her, Kennedy said. Another incident involved white athletes smashing a watermelon on the porch of a black student in Laguna Beach and referring to him by a racist epithet, Kennedy said. Vandals painted swastikas on a Korean church in Buena Park, as well, he said, adding that the bulk of the incidents have targeted Latinos and Muslims.The divisive election has apparently given a sense of license, emboldened people to say horrible nasty things about each other and attack and criticize others based on their perceived nationality or immigrant status or religion or any other aspect about them, Kennedy said. The commission has been actively documenting the incidents and working to counter the stereotypes with alternative stories about good citizens of varying backgrounds, Kennedy said. UC Irvine Chancellor Howard Gillman issued a statement Tuesday condemning the wave of anti-Semitic threats, saying they hit close to home Monday afternoon when our neighboring Merage Jewish Community Center received a bomb threat and was forced to evacuate. Gillman said the despicable demonstrations of violent anti-Semitism assault not only members of our Jewish community, but all people of goodwill. Our Jewish students, faculty, staff, partners and neighbors should take strength from knowing that the UCI community stands with them during these troubling times.

602,"I was asked to be present at a symposium entitled Community Policing and Diversity. Interestingly enough this is an area I worked in when I was teaching at the University of Queensland (Australia) and under contract with the State Police for training at the Academy and with senior Police officials. But that was long ago and far away, so I thought Id better tune up so that I could make an intelligent contribution. We should be doing anything way we can to improve Police services. Though our crime rate is pretty low when compared to the rest of the County, here is South Orange County we have uniformly low rates for everyone, and for Lake Forest, we have a higher crime rate than most of our neighbors. RSM, Aliso Viejo, Laguna Woods, Laguna Niguel, and Mission Viejo all have lower crime rates than we do. And this is not a one year event. For years we have come up at the tail end of the crime rate data when compared to our neighbors. So we can certainly do better, if only to catch up with our neighbors. Could we improve our Police services by having a more diverse Police force? Let start by asking some preliminary questions… WHAT IS DIVERSITY Diversity in law enforcement includes racial and ethnic diversity, sex, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, and gender identity. WHY DIVERSITY MATTERS BARRIERS TO DIVERSITY LACK OF DIVERSITY In 2014 the EEOC received 1,152 charges from police agencies. The basis of complaints was The form of discrimination was EXAMPLES OF LACK OF DIVERSITY Irving Texas, 2015 – 70% of city are minorities, 17% are on police. Hartford, Conn – 84% of city are minorities, 34% are on police. Ferguson, Missiouri – 67% of city are minorities, 6% are on the police. Nationwide, 2013 – 269 Police Depts. Racial minorities under-=represented by total of 24.5%. Agencies least resembling their communities generally serve jurisdictions experiencing major demographic shifts over a number of years. Many of these departments, particularly ones with low turnover, havent hired new officers fast enough to keep pace with changes. New Jersey (-39 percentage points), Connecticut (-36 percentage points), California (-32 percentage points) and Nevada (-30 percentage points) recorded the greatest minority underrepresentation, on average, among their police departments reviewed. IS LAKE FOREST DIVERSE? I asked the City about how diverse our City staff was. The City said they keep no records because they are not required to since the City employs less than 100 people. I asked the Chief of Police how diverse our Police staff was, but he had no idea and referred me to OCSD. I sent a request to OCSD but havent heard back yet. I have no data yet, but as far as I can recall, almost all of our Police officers are White men. Yet our population is not so heavily white men. White people are only 67% of Lake Forests population, and females slightly outnumber males. Hence, white males constitute about 30% of Lake Forests population. Without more definitive data, it looks like we are hardly diverse. Females and racial minorities appear to be significantly underrepresented. Well continue the discussion when the data comes in.

603,"LAKE FOREST, CA A Lake Forest man, his wife and his brother, a police officer from the suburbs of Chicago, were arraigned on charges of assault and battery for allegedly stabbing a teenage boy while he was out walking with his friend in Huntington Beach. Arthur Edward Roman, 28, a police officer with the Oak Forest Police Department in Illinois, his brother Martin Mario Roman, 26, and Martins wife Jessica Monique Moran, 28, both of Lake Forest, are charged with one felony count of assault with force likely to produce great bodily injury and one misdemeanor count of battery. Martin Mario Roman is also charged with a sentencing enhancement for the personal use of a deadly weapon. If convicted, Arthur Roman and Jessica Roman each face a maximum sentence of four years in state prison, and Martin Roman faces a maximum sentence of five years.

Arthur Roman is accused of pushing and punching Jarrah, and Jessica Roman is accused of pushing the boy to the ground and kicking him in the head. Martin Roman allegedly then stabbed Jarrah repeatedly in the rear as he lay on the ground covering his head, according to prosecutors.

According to police, the brawl was caused by a comment interpreted the wrong way, but the 17-year-old stabbing victim alleges the attack was racially motivated. Was it like a racial issue?

I dont know if it (the comment) was good or bad, but it may have been interpreted the wrong way, so they questioned the pedestrians, Marlatt said.

610,"Social equity has been a top priority for the County of Marin for many years, and the Board of Supervisors emphasized its importance again after the Marin community expressed concerns about the changing immigration policy in Washington, D.C. At its March 21 meeting, the Board passed a resolution supporting family unity, community security, dignity and due process for all residents of Marin. It was brought forth in light of recent shifts in federal immigration policy, including executive orders signed by the new administration that have created a climate of fear and uncertainty among immigrant communities nationwide, including our own, as noted in the resolution.With its 22 departments, the County government serves an estimated 16,000 undocumented immigrants, or about 6 percent of the population. Just four months ago, the Supervisors affirmed with a resolution that equity and inclusion are priorities of the County of Marin, and it takes a stand against all forms of discrimination and intolerance. Fostering a relationship of trust, respect and open communication between County employees and County residents, regardless of immigration status, is essential to the Countys core mission of ensuring the heath, well-being and public safety for our entire community, the new resolution reads. Our Board wants to ensure that eligible individuals are able to seek services from the County without regard to immigration status, said Board President Judy Arnold. This reaffirms our commitment to initiatives that build inclusive and equitable communities. I believe this resolution is an affirmation of our promise to stand in the gap with the community and law enforcement for those we serve. The Marin County Office of the Public Defender maintains an Immigrant Resource Toolkit, also in English and Spanish, to help inform residents of their rights. The Marin County District Attorney also recently instituted a Hate Crime Hotline at 415-473-2585 to assure that potential hate crime incidents are properly and promptly investigated. In addition to immigrant protections, the County is making efforts to level the playing field on many fronts in the interest of fairness. In its October 2016 State of the County report, the County chose equity as one of its focal points for 2017. Income disparity in Marin is on the rise, negatively affecting quality of life and even life expectancy for those lower on the socioeconomic scale. The County is dedicated to delivering services to the people who need the help the most, and that often includes recent immigrants. Recent equity efforts include increasing food parity, removing artificial barriers to job recruitment, promoting civil rights, and making open space preserves and parks more accessible to all. The Countys 5 Year Business Plan, approved by the Supervisors in October 2015, focuses on equity and inclusion as the County works to be a more adaptive organization that fosters engagement, learning and leadership. For more than a decade, equity has been one of the Countys guiding goals and official policy guidelines. Equity, education, environment and economy, referred to as the Four Es, which for 10 years as helped prioritize and support a wide variety of County initiatives. — SUBMITTED FOR PUBLICATION BY: County of Marin",0,8,5

612,"A Kentfield man was sentenced to six months in the Marin County jail Wednesday for the road rage beating of a truck driver in Mill Valley last year. Jeffrey Smock, 41, was convicted by a jury in June of felony battery causing serious bodily injury and misdemeanor assault of Roman Laskowski, now 58, of Corte Madera, on April 16, 2014. In addition to jail time, Marin County Superior Court Judge Kelly Vieira Simmons sentenced Smock to three years probation, defense attorney Gerald Schwartzbach said. PREVIOUSLY: Assistant District Attorney Barry Borden said the prosecution asked Simmons to sentence Smock to nine months in jail. Smock faced a maximum term of fours years in prison, Borden said. Smock was riding a bicycle at East Blithedale Avenue and Camino Alto in Mill Valley and Laskowski was driving a truck that Smock claimed clipped him with its mirror. The prosecution alleged Smock attacked Laskowski outside the truck and kept punching him while Laskowski was on the ground. Schwartzbach said the jury did not find Smock caused great bodily injury to Laskowski, and he asked the judge to reduce the felony battery charge to a misdemeanor. Simmons denied the request. The total fight lasted less than a minute in the life of a 41-year-old man with three children who was suffering from post traumatic stress, Schwartzbach said. Once he got hit in the head, his mind went blank. He was in a dissociated state where his mind was not aware of his physical behavior, Schwartzbach said. Smock was suffering from post-traumatic stress at the time of the incident because he was in a small plane crash in Oregon that killed his father-in-law in 2012, Schwartzbach said. Schwartzbach said Smock, a tech entrepreneur, became a poster boy to people who hate bicyclists and financially wealthy people. Schwartzbach argued Smock acted in self-defense and there were conflicting versions of the road rage incident during the trial. He said a witnesses said Laskowski ran after Smock while he was still on his bicycle at the intersection and the fight occurred 20 feet from Laskowskis truck. Borden said Deputy District Attorney Kendra Rudolph presented evidence that the battery Smock inflicted caused serious bodily injury and the jury agreed.",0,8,5
613,"By Bay City News Service Oakland police are helping to develop a training program on implicit racial bias and procedural justice as part of a California Department of Justice effort to address the current crisis of confidence in law enforcement, California Attorney General Kamala Harris announced Friday. The training program, which is being developed with the Stockton Police Departments and Stanford University Professor Jennifer L. Eberhardt, among others, was one of the actions announced following an internal state Department of Justice review of its existing training on the use of force and implicit bias. It will be certified by the Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training, according to state officials. The 90-day review, conducted by the Department of Justices Division of Law Enforcement, also developed policies on implicit bias and racial profiling and created a 21st Century Policing Working Group to foster further discussion. Speaking at an event in Los Angeles, Harris said she hopes the review can be used as a blueprint for police and sheriffs departments throughout the state to critically examine their existing policies and draft recommendations that are appropriate for the communities they serve. Speakers at the event cited the success of Oaklands Operation Ceasefire, a community-based effort to reduce violence and recidivism, as an example for other communities. As a result of the review, the Department of Justice is adopting bodyworn cameras for all special agents conducting field operations and plans to institute new policies on the technologys use.

617,"The following is a collection of weekly police, court and fire stories from around the Long Beach area this week. The victim was pushed to the ground by one of the suspects at a South Bay Starbucks. The 18-year-old is accused of driving the getaway car in a fatal South Los Angeles shooting.F The man was holding an Airsoft or pellet gun that was very realistic-looking, Sheriffs Lt. Rodney Moore told reporters. Police responding to a report of a gunman in Redondo Beach shot and killed the suspect, who turned out to be armed with a pellet gun. One suspect is outstanding after the early morning search near Marine Avenue and Walnut Avenue. Police say the suspect was captured on video surveillance using credit cards stolen from the vehicle burglaries. The woman was in a car when she was shot, according to reports from the scene. The 52-year-old man left a suicide note before departing from his home last week. She was found about 9 p.m. Tuesday, according to Long Beach police. The driver was heading southbound on Studebaker Road when his vehicle hit a center median and a light pole. The pedestrian was struck at about 9:40 p.m. Friday in the 1400 block of Pacific Avenue. The crash shut down Pacific Coast Highway in both directions between Lewis and Alamitos streets, police said. Relatives of the victim are calling the incident a hate crime.

618,"Police searched Tuesday for the person who shot and killed a Long Beach man in a restroom in Pan American Park in what his relatives call a hate crime. The victim, identified as Fredrick Renay Taft, 57, of Long Beach, was shot in the upper body and pronounced dead at the park in the 5100 block of Centralia Street Saturday afternoon, according to Assistant Chief Ed Winter of the Los Angeles County Coroners Office. Police have not released a motive for the shooting, but Tafts relatives told the Los Angeles Times they believe he was targeted because he is black. Taft was attending a family reunion in the park with between 40 and 50 people in attendance, Tafts nephew David Malonson told the Times. A friend of Tafts who was at the party told the newspaper she saw a man carrying a rifle run out of the bathroom toward Centralia Avenue after the shooting. Detectives had not uncovered any evidence of a hate crime, said Arantxa Chavarria, a Long Beach police spokeswoman, in an email to the Times. Evidence is still being collected and analyzed. Tafts daughter told the paper a person who had been playing softball nearby said his group had been harassed in the park hours before the shooting by a group of white men on bikes who were using racial slurs.

620,"A Muslim woman has won $85,000 in damages from the city of Long Beach after her religious head scarf was forcibly removed by a local police officer, according to court papers obtained Thursday. Kirsty Powell filed a federal civil rights complaint after police officers forcibly removed her hijab in view of other male officers and dozens of inmates. Powell wears the hijab as part of her religious beliefs and was forced to spend the night without the covering while in custody. She described the experience as deeply traumatizing, according to the complaint. The Long Beach City Council voted Tuesday to approve the settlement. After the suit was filed, the Long Beach Police Department amended its policy to accommodate religious head coverings for persons in custody. Long Beach joins neighboring jurisdictions of Orange and San Bernardino counties, which both adopted similar policies following lawsuits. We commend Kirsty Powell for choosing to defend her right to religious freedom and taking action, said civil rights attorney Marwa Rifahie of the Los Angeles chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. Powell was arrested during a traffic stop in May 2015 on outstanding warrants. During the arrest, she was told by the officers that she would have to remove her hijab. Powell made several requests for a female officer to search her and was denied requests to continue wearing her hijab in custody. The officers informed her that she was not allowed to wear her hijab and that they were allowed to touch a woman, the lawsuit states. I would never want anyone to go through what I felt from this experience, Powell said when the suit was filed last year in Los Angeles federal court. I want my Muslim sisters to always feel comfortable and safe wearing a hijab and to stand up for whats right. City News Service Image via Shutterstock",1,3,0
621,"- Long Beach police Thursday were looking for whoever spray-painted the word illegal on a van owned by a man of Mexican ancestry who said his family has been in this country for several generations. The crime occurred over the weekend while the vehicle was parked in the 300 block of Euclid Avenue, said Marlene Arrona of the Long Beach Police Department. A banner sign a couple of blocks away, in the 300 block of Termino Avenue, also was spray-painted with the word illegal, Arrona said. The investigation remains ongoing and a motive is yet to be determined, she said. The vans owner, Joe Solis, told the Long Beach Press-Telegram that a neighbor alerted him to the vandalism Sunday morning, and he thinks someone must have scrawled the message on his bright yellow Volkswagen bus while it was parked in front of his house Saturday night. Solis, who is Mexican and Jewish, said the racial implication of the spray-painted message didnt hit him right away. His first thought was to double-check that his van was parked legally. I didnt understand it at first because it said illegal on it and I couldnt put two and two together, he told the newspaper. Solis said his family members have been born and raised in the United States for six generations. It wasnt until his mother-in-law said she thought the graffiti was a hate crime that Solis realized someone could be targeting him for his Mexican heritage. I never really felt like that before, like I dont belong, Solis said. Police havent determined a motive for the vandalism but said it was possible that the crime was bias motivated. Long Beach resident Michael Zarghami said he was surprised by the graffiti. He and a roommate were driving past Solis house Tuesday when they saw the vandalized van and felt compelled to stop and find out what had happened. I think she and I were just kind of floored at what we saw, Zarghami said. The two didnt expect to see a message apparently targeting someone for his race in a city as diverse as Long Beach, he said. Zarghami and Solis both pointed to the tense political climate as a possible motivating factor for the graffiti. But Solis said his community has rallied around him since the graffiti appeared. When he took his van to a shop to have the word removed, the service was performed for free, Solis said. He also got a note on his homes front door saying We love you in our neighborhood. Police asked that anyone with information about the vandalism call detectives at (562) 570-7250, or Crime Stoppers at (800) 222-TIPS. -- City News Service, photo via Shutterstock",1,0,3
622,"- The state Supreme Court refused Wednesday to hear the case against a man convicted of killing another man with a screwdriver in Long Beach in a case of mistaken identity. The states highest court denied the defense petition seeking review of the case against Arturo Ruiz Torres, who was found guilty in December 2014 of second-degree murder for Anthony Ramirezs Nov. 3, 2013, stabbing death. In a 12-page ruling in July, a three-justice panel from Californias 2nd District Court of Appeal rejected the defenses contention that the trial judge should have been required to define the terms mistake or accident when explaining the provocation for voluntary manslaughter and that jurors should have been instructed on the crime of involuntary manslaughter. Here, there is no question that defendants acts were objectively dangerous to human life -- he stabbed his victim three times with a screwdriver and with such tremendous force that one of the blows cracked a rib. There is also no material issue as to whether defendant subjectively appreciated the danger his conduct posed, the appellate court justices found in their ruling. Torres and another man gave chase after a man walked by, displayed gang signs and yelled racial slurs in an alleyway behind an apartment, the appeals court panel noted. Defendant was the faster runner and jumped someone. It was not the same person who had insulted the group, and the man pleaded with the defendant, Why me? the appellate court justices noted. The appeals court panel noted that Torres -- wielding a screwdriver he had been using to open beer cans -- stabbed the man three times. Torres was arrested six days later by Long Beach police. He was sentenced in February 2015 to 16 years to life in state prison. -- City News Service, photo via Shutterstock",1,0,3
623,"A Muslim civil liberties group sued the city of Long Beach and its police chief Monday on behalf of a woman who allegedly had her religious head scarf forcibly removed by a local police officer. According to the complaint, filed in Los Angeles federal court, Kirsty Powell and her husband -- who are black -- were in a car pulled over by a male Long Beach Police Department officer. Powell was arrested on an outstanding warrant, but was told by the officer that she would have to remove her head scarf, according to the suit filed by the Greater Los Angeles Area chapter of the Council on American- Islamic Relations. After making several requests for a female officer to search her, Powell was told by male officers that she was not allowed to wear her hijab and that policemen were allowed to touch a woman, according to the civil rights complaint. A message left with the Long Beach City Attorneys Office was not immediately returned. Powell contends that while she was handcuffed at the station house, the arresting officer allegedly forcibly removed her religious head covering and forced her to remain exposed overnight, in plain view of other male officers and dozens of inmates. During her booking and subsequent search, at least four female officers were on duty, including one that escorted her to a holding cell after her headscarf had been removed, the lawsuit states. The actions taken by the Long Beach Police officers were unwarranted and a serious violation of Mrs. Powells bodily integrity, said CAIR-LA attorney Yalda Satar. The manner in which Mrs. Powell was treated by LBPD officers was simply a show of authority over a woman of color who was unable to protect herself, and is another example of the type of discrimination faced by women who wear a hijab. --City News Service, photo via Shutterstock",1,3,0

626,"A violent tirade by a Los Alamitos area 7-Eleven patron led to his pleading guilty, Wednesday, to a misdemeanor charge for hitting a clerk in the head. The man also hurling bananas at another employee and knocking over two cash registers when his payment card was declined for a candy purchase. Daniel Jonas Fine, who pleaded guilty to battery, vandalism and assault, was placed on three years of informal probation. The 42-year-old defendant was also sentenced to 30 days in jail, but he has been in custody since April 18. Santa Ana police released video of the Feb. 11 attack at the convenience store at 902 W. First St., which generated numerous tips that led to Fines arrest two weeks later, according to Santa Ana police Cpl. Anthony Bertagna. An arrest warrant for the Santa Ana resident was served April 18 at a sober-living home. Apparently he has a history of doing stuff like this and is currently on probation, Bertagna said then. The surveillance video shows a customer attempting to buy a package of almond M&Ms when his card -- either a credit or debit -- is declined, Bertagna said. The suspect can be seen hitting the clerk in the head, pushing a cash register to the floor and then throwing bananas at another clerk before pushing his register off the counter, as well.

He was making racial comments to the clerks and they were just trying to not react, Bertagna said. He became even more belligerent when his credit or debit card was declined. Court records show Fine has a criminal history in Orange County dating back to 2014, when he was charged with hit-and-run involving injury or death. The felony count was dismissed in a plea bargain in which he admitted a misdemeanor count of assault with a deadly weapon other than a firearm and was ordered to complete 30 days of community service. Fines probation in that case was revoked in April 2016 and he was sentenced last December to 120 days in jail as part of a plea deal in two other cases, according to court records. Fine also pleaded guilty Dec. 13 to battery on a peace officer, a misdemeanor, and another count of misdemeanor battery in a separate case, according to court records.

When police arrested a man wanted for rape and murder in New York, he was allegedly holding another woman against her will in Los Angeles. The 22-year-old was arrested just hours after the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Florida that left 49 people and the gunman dead. LAPD Chief Michel Moore said the department is reviewing less-lethal options after two bystanders were killed by officers this month. Police are investigating the circumstances surrounding the shooting of a little boy in South Los Angeles.

632,"An Indiana man pleaded no contest Wednesday to three felony charges stemming from an incident where police seized weapons, ammunition and bomb-making materials found in his car while heading to the 2016 LA Pride parade in West Hollywood. He was immediately sentenced to seven years and four months in state prison. James Wesley Howell, 22, pleaded no contest to one count each of unlawful assault weapon activity, possession of a destructive device on a public road or highway and possession of a destructive device, Deputy District Attorney Samuel Hulefeld said. Howell was arrested shortly before 6 a.m. on June 12, 2016, by Santa Monica police in the 1700 block of 11th Street, near Olympic Boulevard – mere hours after the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, that left 49 people and the gunman dead. Howell was found sitting in his car when officers responded to a report of a man knocking on a residents door and window. Officers examined Howells white Acura sedan with Indiana license plates and recovered three assault rifles, high-capacity magazines and ammunition along with a five-gallon bucket with chemicals that could have been used to make an improvised explosive device, police said. The sheriffs department bomb squad was called to help make certain the vehicle and area were safe. According to court documents, Howell also had a buck knife, a Taser, a black hood, handcuffs and a security badge in his car. Howell told police he was planning to attend the 46th annual LA Pride Parade and Festival in West Hollywood, but made no reference to doing harm there, according to Santa Monica police Lt. Saul Rodriguez. Santa Monica police Chief Jacqueline Seabrooks and Rodriguez said there was no known connection between Howell and the mass shooting in Orlando. Security was increased at the LA Pride festival as a result of the Orlando massacre and Howells arrest. During Howells arraignment on June 14, 2016, the prosecutor said the defendant had 20 pounds of explosive mix in his car, along with five gallons of gasoline – materials that could create an explosive similar to the one used in the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building. Some of the materials were already mixed in a bucket in the car, the prosecutor said. One day after the charges were filed against him in Los Angeles, Howell was charged with sexually molesting a 12-year-old girl in Indiana. According to the Indianapolis Star, Indiana officials believe Howell left for California after learning he was under investigation in the molestation case. Citing court documents and the victims family, the newspaper also reported that Howell threatened to kill himself, members of the victims family and police if they tried to arrest him.

633,"Police arrested a Los Angeles woman suspected of beating a 91-year-old man with a block of concrete while shouting apparently racist slurs at him because he inadvertently bumped into her daughter on the sidewalk on the Fourth of July. However, authorities do not believe the attack was a hate crime. Detectives Wednesday announced the arrest of Laquisha Jones, 30, of Los Angeles, at 10 p.m. Tuesday near 60th Street and Crenshaw Avenue in Los Angeles, according to a statement from the Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department. The attack happened at approximately 7:30 p.m. on July 4 in the area of East 118th and Robin streets, said Deputy Matt Luna of the Century Station. A woman confronted 91-year-old Rodolfo Rodriguez when he bumped into her little girl, according to Rodriguezs family. According to the family, Rodriguez was struck from behind, fell down and blacked out. A neighbor driving by witnessed the assault. She saw the woman hitting him with a cinder block, and she took a photo of the suspect as she walked away. She was yelling at him, Go back to your country, or Go back to Mexico, witness Misbel Borjas told the Los Angeles Times. It was racist. When I tried to videotape her with my cell phone, she threw that same concrete block, tried to hit my car, said Misbel Borjas, who managed to snap a photo of the woman showing her still holding the piece of concrete. Despite Borjas account, sheriffs investigators said Wednesday that while they have not identified a motive for the attack, it was not believed to have been a hate crime. Through their investigation Century Station detectives have discovered that this is not a hate-related incident, according to the sheriffs department. According to Borjas , a few men returned to continue the assault as she was dialing 911. Detectives are still investigating to determine if other suspects remain at large. Rodriguez suffered bruises and a broken facial bone. Originally from Mexico, Rodriguez is a lawful permanent resident who takes nightly walks to the park to sit on a bench, his family told the Los Angeles Times. He doesnt speak English and couldnt understand why the attack was happening. Deputies went to a hospital and took an assault report from the victim, Rodolfo Rodriguez. Following an extensive investigation, detectives obtained an arrest and search warrant for Jones, who was taken into custody without incident, according to Deputy Marvin Crowder. Jones was booked for assault with a deadly weapon and is being held in lieu of $200,000 bail. A weapon has not been located and a motive for the assault has not been determined, Crowder said . Rodriguez was released from the hospital to recover from his injuries at home with his family. In the meantime, loved ones are hoping to raise money to pay for the medical bills of Rodriguez. As of Monday, they passed their goal of $15,000 and raised more than $34,000. To donate or for more information, go to gofundme.com.

RELATED: Boy, 10, Came Out As Gay Shortly Before His Violent Death According to NBC4, Leiva was told he would be taken into custody during an interview with sheriffs homicide detectives. At that point, he revealed a wound that he said he inflicted upon himself as a suicide attempt, the station reported, citing law enforcement sources. An ambulance -- along with a sheriffs escort -- took Leiva to a hospital, according to Channel 4. Once he is medically cleared, Leiva was to be booked and his bail set at $2 million, McDonnell said. A total of eight children were removed from the home where Anthony lived with his mother, who had several children with the suspect. Leiva lived at the home on and off, sheriffs Capt. Christpher Bergner said. On Tuesday, the Board of Supervisors approved a motion by Supervisor Kathryn Barger calling for a thorough review of why Anthony wasnt removed from his family home, despite a dozen reports to the Department of Children and Family Services between 2013-16, including a substantiated allegation of sexual abuse by a grandparent when the boy was 4 years old. You had teachers, you had family members, you had law enforcement come in contact. And yet, Anthonys at the morgue; were awaiting autopsy results, Barger said. One has to wonder what its going to take to get the attention of not only the social workers, but the public in general, because Im told that neighbors also were aware of what was taking place. As all agencies work tirelessly to get to the bottom of what happened, each day brings to light new updates and information about Anthonys senseless death, according to a statement released by DCFS Director Bobby Cagle. While we cannot comment on an ongoing criminal investigation, we are committed to cooperating with our law enforcement partners. I reiterate my deep commitment to seeing justice done on behalf of this innocent child. Our hearts go out to those that have been so deeply affected by this tragedy. Barger and other county officials repeatedly said that they would wait for all the facts to come in before drawing conclusions about exactly what happened to the boy. However, Barger called it a senseless murder, explaining that we dont have a conclusion, but theres no other explanation. Barger noted that an 8-year-old Palmdale boy was beaten to death in 2013 by his mothers boyfriend, despite multiple calls to DCFS over a period of years. The boyfriend has been sentenced to death for the crime and Gabriels mother was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Four DCFS officials are awaiting trial on criminal charges stemming from Gabriels death. Another potential parallel was a concern that homophobia may have contributed to both boys abuse. Although a possible motive in Anthonys case remains under investigation, Cagle told City News Service that he was told that Anthony said he liked boys and girls and that the context of the boys comment was not entirely clear. Bergner said at the news conference that homophobia was not immediately suspected as a factor in the boys death. That has not come up in our investigation as a motivation at this time, he said. A previous statement released by Cagle laying out details of the case said Anthony had been severely beaten and was malnourished when paramedics arrived last Wednesday in response to his mothers 911 call. The first call to DCFS was in February 2013 alleging sexual abuse of then-4-year-old Anthony by a grandparent not living in the home. The allegation was substantiated, and the boy was given a medical exam and referred for services. Following a second call in March 2013, repeating the same allegation, the case was closed when social workers determined that the mother was appropriately safe, according to Cagles statement. The remaining 10 reports involved allegations of sexual, emotional and physical abuse, as well as general neglect, Cagle said. Some were substantiated, while others were unfounded. In private interviews, Anthony disclosed details consistent with media reports that he was beaten, locked up, and not fed, according to the statement. Anthony was sent to live with relatives while the family received in- home counseling, medical and other services and ultimately returned home when social workers deemed it was safe to do so. The last call to DCFS, alleging general neglect, was made in April 2016. Anthony was interviewed, the allegations were deemed unfounded or inconclusive and the referral was closed in May 2016, Cagle said. Callers to DCFS alleged that Anthony or his siblings were denied food and water, sexually abused, beaten and bruised, dangled upside-down from a staircase, forced to crouch for hours, locked in small spaces with no access to the bathroom, forced to fight each other, and forced to eat from the trash, sources told The Times. McDonnell said that some of the injuries the boy was reported to have suffered were grossly overstated. Callers made allegations against several family members, including Anthonys mother, Heather Barron, and Leiva, according to the sources cited by the newspaper. Barron and Leiva continued to use the grandparent who allegedly sexually abused Anthony for child care even after being made aware of the accusation, The Times sources alleged. An aunt interviewed by the newspaper said she began alerting DCFS in 2015, when she noticed bruises and other injuries that the children told her were caused by Leiva. She said the children also reported Leiva locking them in small spaces where they had to urinate and defecate on the floor. Leiva was convicted in 2010 of domestic abuse, The Times reported. Cagle said the seven other children in the home have all been placed elsewhere and are receiving critical support services, like therapy. The DCFS director told CNS that he could not disclose whether they were all siblings. City News Service",0,8,5
635,"A 25-year-old man arrested in connection with a series of arson fires and vandalism targeting Southland houses of worship, most recently in Boyle Heights, was charged Monday with 22 criminal counts. Christian Michael Garcia appeared in a downtown courtroom this afternoon, but his arraignment was postponed until Feb. 26. He is facing 20 felony charges -- 13 counts of vandalism of a religious property, three counts of arson of a structure, two counts of second- degree commercial burglary and one count each of attempted second-degree robbery and arson of property -- plus two misdemeanor counts of vandalism under $400. The criminal complaint also includes hate crime allegations. Bail was set at $750,000 and, if convicted as charged, Garcia faces a maximum sentence of more than 23 years in prison. He was arrested Friday by the Inter-Agency House of Worship Task Force for crimes prosecutors said took place between Nov. 25, 2016, and Jan. 25, 2018, involving four churches in Pasadena and Los Angeles. Garcia is also charged with vandalizing the sheriffs station in Industry. Arson is an egregious crime in all forms, but acts of arson against houses of worship are especially harmful as they are a violation against a holy sanctuary, a sanctuary that often anchors an entire neighborhood, that offers a place of peace and spirituality for the community, Los Angeles Fire Department Chief Ralph Terrazas said. The most recent crimes for which Garcia is suspected are a fire and vandalism at Resurrection Church on Thursday in Boyle Heights and the Church of the Angels in Pasadena on Jan. 13. Los Angeles Police Department Chief Charlie Beck said Garcia was literally caught red-handed on Friday while he was about to vandalize another church -- Mount Olive Church of Christ in God in South Los Angeles. Thursdays fire was reported at 2:05 a.m. at Resurrection Church in the 3300 block of East Opal Street. It took about 60 firefighters nearly 30 minutes to extinguish the fire, which burned primarily on the first floor. The flames were kept from the main sanctuary, said Los Angeles Fire Department Capt. Erik Scott. The Pasadena fire at Church of the Angels broke out at 2:20 a.m. Jan. 13 at 1100 N. Avenue 64. The blaze at the 129-year-old Episcopalian church was classified as a hate crime, according to fire officials, who said a few historic statues were significantly damaged, and there was fire and smoke damage inside the church. The collaboration of our federal and local partners and the tireless work of investigators from the various agencies in the task force, made this arrest possible and is a testament to the productive working relationship first responders have here in Southern California when a community is threatened by criminal activity, Pasadena Fire Chief Bertral Washington and Pasadena Police Chief Philip Sanchez said in a joint statement issued earlier. City Councilman Jose Huizar, who represents Boyle Heights and other Eastside communities, thanked the LAFD Arson Unit, the LAPD, Pasadena police and fire agencies for their remarkable work and expediency in ensuring the person responsible for these and other heinous crimes will be held accountable. Mayor Eric Garcetti also hailed the work of investigators for helping people feel safer in houses of worship. These crimes are difficult to understand, he said. We dont know the motive. But we do know that when we stand together strong in the face of this senseless hate, this city will always rise. City News Service City News Service; Photo: Youtube screengrab",1,3,1
636,"When a prosecutor announced last week that he had charged a Los Angeles man with murdering his son for being gay, the case got all the national attention you might expect, all the outrage it deserved and the kind of universal condemnation of the father that gels almost instantly only in particularly brutal or hateful crimes. Never mind that judgment was passed by those with no real knowledge of the case beyond the prosecutors homophobic father kills gay son theory. The fathers name is Kalil Issa, who is 69, and his sons name is Amir Issa, shot dead at 29. When police arrived at the family home in North Hills, they found the sons body and arrested the old man. They found another victim, too. It was Rabihah Issa, who investigators determined had been stabbed to death well before the shooting. Los Angeles Times reporters Peter Jamison , Cindy Carcamo and Matt Stevens dove into the case, and pubished an intriguing article over the weekend based on information from law enforcement agencies and interviews with the Issa familys neighbors. What they found suggested that the case is not as simple s portrayed but rather a complex and long-brewing mix of drugs, mental illness, homophobia and extreme family dysfunction that came to a jolting, and maybe even predictable, end.

638,"SANTA CLARA - Police are investigating a possible hate crime in Santa Clara where a mans car was filled with anti-gay messages earlier this week, a police spokesman said Friday. The victim, a man in his 30s, found multiple homophobic messages on his car parked outside his apartment complex on Karen Drive sometime Sunday, police Lt. Dan Moreno said. The man found pamphlets, a DVD, booklets and other notes on how to not be gay along with a gay slur that appeared to be handwritten over dew on his windshield, Moreno said. There was also a message on the car against having gay people or smokers at the complex, according to Moreno. The man, who is gay, didnt notify police until Monday morning, the lieutenant said. A detective has been assigned to investigate the case, which has been classified as a suspicious circumstance, and is following up on leads, Moreno said.

The victim was pushed to the ground by one of the suspects at a South Bay Starbucks. The 18-year-old is accused of driving the getaway car in a fatal South Los Angeles shooting.F The man was holding an Airsoft or pellet gun that was very realistic-looking, Sheriffs Lt. Rodney Moore told reporters. Police responding to a report of a gunman in Redondo Beach shot and killed the suspect, who turned out to be armed with a pellet gun. One suspect is outstanding after the early morning search near Marine Avenue and Walnut Avenue. Police say the suspect was captured on video surveillance using credit cards stolen from the vehicle burglaries. The woman was in a car when she was shot, according to reports from the scene. The 52-year-old man left a suicide note before departing from his home last week. She was found about 9 p.m. Tuesday, according to Long Beach police. The driver was heading southbound on Studebaker Road when his vehicle hit a center median and a light pole. The pedestrian was struck at about 9:40 p.m. Friday in the 1400 block of Pacific Avenue.

640,"A new scam targeting religious or spiritual seniors, particularly those in immigrant communities, has resulted in exploitation and loss of cash and valuables. The Blessing Scam is a con in which an elderly person is promised a blessing or spiritual healing by putting valuable items and cash in a bag which is then secretly swapped for an empty bag, according to the Los Angeles District Attorneys Office. The scam has been particularly prevalent in the Chinese community. The scammers work in a group, pretending not to know each other and then befriending or cornering the victim. After striking up conversation, they ask the senior personal questions which are secretly transmitted to the faux psychic/spirit doctor. Then, the supposed spirit doctor will show up and use the information gathered to convince the senior of their psychic abilities. The psychic will eventually convince the victim that a terrible misfortune awaits the senior or a family member, unless a blessing ceremony is performed. In one recent case, a senior put more than $70,000 in cash and jewelry in a bag for a blessing, according to the District Attorneys Office. The scammers switched out the bag full of money for an empty one,and instructed her not to open it for two days so the blessing would work.

641,"- The countys inspector general praised the Sheriffs Department for its efforts to improve conditions at jails in a report presented to the Board of Supervisors Tuesday. Inspector General Max Huntsman said he and his staff were pleased with the departments efforts to identify issues and reform its Custody Services and Patrol Division policies, practices, and operations. In particular, the report cited efforts to reduce the number of prisoners in isolation, increase inmates time out of their cells and better train custody deputies to deal with mentally ill inmates. Changes in policies dealing with transgender inmates were also commended. Department policy had generally been to house transgender women in a special section of Mens Central Jail, separate from the general population. Transgender men were part of the general womens population at the Century Regional Detention Facility. That solution has typically kept inmates safe, according to the report, though it acknowledged special problems with transgender inmates with mental illness or subject to disciplinary measures. In those cases, transgender women are typically held in cells in all- male pods and have been subject to verbal and emotional abuse, leading for calls to create a separate unit. The department has created a Gender Identity Committee that now considers inmates needs on a case-by-case basis. The committee granted the request of one transgender inmate to be reassigned to the Century Regional Detention Facility, housing her in a segregated unit after consultation with community advocates. The OIG and the department had some initial concerns for the prisoners safety and emotional well-being, but ... she is happy with her new housing assignment, the report stated. Huntsman said Sheriff Jim McDonnell has consistently been willing to collaborate and he and his staff are receptive to recommendations. However, the statistics offered in the report raise some concerns. Inmate on inmate attacks nearly doubled between 2011 and 2015, the last year for which data was provided. And while both assaults on staff and the use of force by custody deputies declined from 2009-2012, they have been steadily increasing and more than doubled since then. Assistant Sheriff Kelly Harrington told the board that use of force remains a last resort but said the reasons for its increase were complex. One issue is the skyrocketing number of inmates with mental illness, which represents an unstable population inside the jails, Harrington said. And even as the department is praised for adding more out-of-cell programming for inmates, that movement in and out of the cells represents more opportunities for some kind of assault on other inmates or staff to take place, Harrington said. Custody officials have consistently pointed to more diligent reporting of the use of force as another reason for the rise. With the closed-captioned televisions that are there now, everything is picked, Harrington said. So the staff are reporting all the use of force, whether it be minor or not. Harrington pointed out the most of the increase relates to a very minor type of force, such as physically guiding inmates or using pepper spray on them. Its not like you would see in the past where inmates are having their bones broken or their (eye sockets) broken, Harrington said. There has been a drastic reduction in those types of incidents, Harrington told the board. Another issue is the home-brewed alcohol that inmates make from candy they buy in the jail commissary. When inmates are drunk, the odds of an altercation go up. And though its long been a problem, Harrington also mentioned the antiquated design of Mens Central Jail. Supervisor Kathryn Barger agreed. We have a jail that, quite frankly, is not suitable for use, Barger said. When I first started, that was the debate. Do we close it? Barger began working as a county intern 28 years ago. A replacement for the downtown jail was approved by the board in 2015 -- over the objections of community activists -- and planning is underway. The report also aggregates statistics that are sometimes hard to access. Five civilians and one deputy were killed in deputy-involved shootings during the last three months of 2016, according to a report presented Tuesday by the countys inspector general. In addition to the fatalities, four civilians and two deputies were shot but survived. One of those deputies was critically injured. There were 11 deputy-involved shootings in total during the fourth quarter of last year. All of the individuals shot or shot at by deputies were men. Six were Hispanic, three were white, one was black and one was Asian. Each of the shootings involved an injury or death has been submitted to the District Attorneys Office for review. -- By ELIZABETH MARCELLINO, City News Service. Photo via Shutterstock",0,8,5
642,"LOS ANGELES - A Jamaican man was indicted by a federal grand jury for allegedly giving nearly 60 pounds of cocaine to a JetBlue flight attendant who tried to smuggle the narcotics onto a plane at LAX last March, the U.S. Attorneys Office announced Friday. Gaston Brown, 39, is already serving federal prison time in Florida for illegally re-entering the country after being deported. He allegedly provided cocaine to Marsha Gay Reynolds, who pleaded guilty to a federal charge in December and is awaiting sentencing. Brown, was charged Thursday with one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine, and one count of possession with intent to distribute cocaine. A judge issued a writ directing that Brown be brought to Los Angeles for an arraignment, which will likely be in mid-February, according to the U.S. Attorneys Office. Reynolds, 32, admitted trying to smuggle nearly 60 pounds of cocaine worth up to $3 million in her carry-on luggage, then fled when pulled aside for a random baggage search at LAX. She pleaded guilty to a single count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine. Sentencing is scheduled for March 13 on the felony charge, which is punishable by a 10-year mandatory minimum prison term. This case demonstrates law enforcements commitment to disrupting dangerous drug trafficking networks, said Eileen M. Decker, the U.S. attorney in Los Angeles. After making the large seizure of narcotics at LAX, investigators continued to look into this matter, which resulted in the indictment of a defendant who was trafficking a significant amount of cocaine, she said. If Brown is convicted of the drug trafficking charges, he would face a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years in federal prison and a maximum possible sentence of life. - City News Service / Image via @LAInternationalAirport Facebook",0,8,5
643,"- A former JetBlue Airways flight attendant who tried to smuggle nearly 60 pounds of cocaine worth up to $3 million in her carry-on luggage, then fled when pulled aside for a baggage search at Los Angeles International Airport, pleaded guilty Monday to a federal charge. Marsha Gay Reynolds, 32, entered her plea to a single count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine. Shes scheduled to be sentenced March 13 on the felony charge, which is punishable by a 10-year mandatory minimum prison term, according to the U.S. Attorneys Office. Reynolds was initially charged with possession with intent to distribute, but the allegations against her expanded to conspiracy involving an unindicted co-conspirator, documents obtained by City News Service show. Reynolds, of Queens, New York, sprinted down an up escalator and out of LAX, leaving behind her luggage, after she was randomly selected for secondary screening March 18. The following day, she worked a JetBlue flight back to New York and surrendered to U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents there on March 23, according to Assistant U.S. Attorney Reema M. El-Amamy. A former beauty pageant contestant in Jamaica, Reynolds had been a New York-based JetBlue employee for six years. Her lawyer said she was also a nursing student, but withdrew from school before her arrest. The drug discovery was made March 18 in Terminal 4 by a Transportation Security Administration security officer who was screening the airline attendants carry-on bags as part of a random search. As a crew member, Reynolds would ordinarily get to bypass bag screening. As the TSA officer led Reynolds to a location to be searched, she made a cell phone call -- speaking in what sounded like a foreign language -- then kicked off her Gucci high heels and ran from the terminal down the up escalator, according to an affidavit filed in the case. Upon being notified she was going to secondary screening, she appeared nervous and kept her distance from the supervisor, U.S. District Judge Andre Birotte said at an April hearing. And before the bags were even open, she utilized her track skills to flee from the airport. Reynolds abandoned luggage was found to contain 11 individually wrapped packages -- labeled Big Ranch -- that were taken to the Los Angeles polices Forensic Science Division, where the contents tested positive for cocaine, court papers show. It takes a very bold criminal to run through the airport -- and come back the next day and flee the district, El-Amamy said after the April hearing. Following the foiled drug-smuggling attempt, Marshall McClain, president of the Los Angeles Airport Police Officers Association, called for 100 percent screening of all airport employees. -- City News Service, photo courtesy of the Airport Police Department",0,8,5

645,"- The gunman who opened fire inside a Los Angeles International Airport terminal three years ago, killing a TSA officer and wounding three other people, was sentenced Monday to life in prison plus 60 years. Paul Ciancia, 26, pleaded guilty in September to the murder of Transportation Security Administration officer and father of two Gerardo Hernandez on Nov. 1, 2013, when he opened fire at LAX, setting off a panic. The plea to 11 felony counts spared him the death penalty. U.S. District Judge Philip Gutierrez recommended Ciancia be sent to the Federal Medical Center in Rochester, Minnesota, saying the defendant needs mental health treatment. Speaking in a high-pitched voice, Ciancia made a bizarre, angry statement to the court, blaming a run-in with Los Angeles police, the gun- control debate and cable news networks for fueling his apparent hate for airport screeners. I want to take this opportunity to give a very brief account of what led up to all of this, the defendant began, telling the judge that after losing his job, he originally planned to spend his life savings of $26,000 before killing himself. With TV news channels blaring at home, continuously talking about the gun control debate, Ciancia said, he told himself, I needed to get a gun. At about the same time, he was harassed by LAPD and I knew exactly how I was going to die, he told the crowded courtroom, packed with Los Angeles airport police, TSA officers, survivors and others. I heard that TSA was the most hated agency in America, Ciancia said, his voice rising in anger. I saw videos of them harassing handicapped people. ... I wanted to make a statement. Along with killing Hernandez, Ciancia wounded TSA Officers Tony Grigsby and James Speer, and teacher Brian Ludmer. Ciancia apologized to Ludmer, saying, I am so sorry. If theres anything I can do, I hope youll write to me. Ludmer made a victim impact statement, telling of lasting physical and emotional injuries from the shooting. You should be apologizing to the wife of the man you murdered, Ludmer said. Your apology means nothing to me. Ludmer said Ciancias behavior in the years leading up to the attack should have raised red flags and should have resulted in mental health treatment. Ciancia should never have been allowed to get anywhere near an assault rifle, the schoolteacher said. In imposing sentence, Gutierrez referred to Ciancias mental health problems and continued delusions. He said that Ciancia is obviously in need of significant mental health treatment. While the hearing was taking place, Ciancia frequently turned toward a group of uniformed airport police officers in the audience, staring at them with a smile. The judge suggested that the defendant be designated promptly for incarceration. Ciancia, an unemployed motorcycle mechanic from New Jersey, intentionally targeted federal airport screeners, whose work stations he called Nazi checkpoints in a note found after the rampage, according to court documents. Describing himself as a pissed-off patriot, Ciancias goal appeared to be a disruption of the functioning of the government by dissuading federal officers from the performance of their duties, prosecutors wrote. Although most of the court documents dealing with the case have been filed under seal, some papers that are available offer a glimpse of the assessment of those who have examined the defendant. One document makes reference to Ciancias apparently documented history of killing insects and animals, committing violence towards both animals and people while in the community and preoccupation with violent content. Ciancias apparent killing of a goose is also discussed. Both sides agree that Ciancia suffers from a variety of mental health issues and has a preoccupation with suicide. The designation of a medical center was seen as a win for the defense. Ciancia walked into Terminal 3 at LAX and opened fire with a semiautomatic rifle while carrying dozens of rounds of ammunition, along with a signed handwritten note saying he wanted to kill TSA agents and instill fear in your traitorous minds. Witnesses to the shooting said the gunman asked them whether they worked for the TSA, and if they said no, he moved on. Ciancia, who had been living in the Sun Valley area of Los Angeles for about 18 months, was shot in the neck and leg during a gun battle with airport police. Federal prosecutors cited substantial planning and premeditation. Ciancia purchased his weapon almost seven months prior to the attack and concealed it on the day of the shooting by tying two pieces of luggage together to create a carrying case, according to court records. On the day of the rampage, Ciancia sent text messages to his brother and sister in which he called himself a patriot. Im so sorry that I have to leave you prematurely, but it is for the greater good of humanity, he wrote to his brother. This was the purpose I was brought here. To his sister, Ciancia wrote that he had to stand up to these tyrants, and asked her not to let the media distort his actions. There wasnt a terrorist attack on Nov. 1, he wrote. There was a pissed-off patriot trying to water the tree of liberty. In previous court appearances, the defendant has shown no reaction to the proceedings. Perhaps an experts assessment, described in a defense document, suggests a reason. Ciancia believes he will get out of prison when the revolution begins, it says. -- By FRED SHUSTER, City News Service. Photo courtesy of the DAs office",1,8,0
646,"The alleged hit-and-run motorist accused of killing a 72- year-old woman by crashing a car into a house in the Harbor Gateway area was charged Monday with vehicular manslaughter and driving with a suspended or revoked license. Rashanda Norman, 34, was scheduled to be arraigned Monday afternoon in a Compton courtroom. Norman surrendered to authorities Thursday night and was being held on $50,000 bail. The crash, which killed Elsa De Belen and injured 11 other people, occurred just after 8 p.m. Wednesday at 14837 S. Orchard Ave., near the Harbor (110) Freeway, according to the Los Angeles Police Department and Brian Humphrey of the Los Angeles Fire Department. At least one victim was trapped inside the home, underneath the car, for a time. All but one of the victims were women, and the patients taken to hospitals — three of whom were listed in critical condition — range in age from their 40s to 80s, KCAL9 reported.

649,"A JetBlue Airways flight attendant who allegedly tried to smuggle nearly 60 pounds of cocaine in her carry-on luggage and fled when Los Angeles International Airport security officials pulled her aside for a random baggage search has been ordered jailed without bail pending trial. Marsha Gay Reynolds, 31, who allegedly kicked off her Gucci high heels as she ran from the airport March, was initially granted $500,000 bail during a hearing in a New York court last month, but a Los Angeles judge overturned the decision. She now faces a post-indictment arraignment in Los Angeles federal court on April 22. A former beauty pageant contestant in her native Jamaica, Reynolds has been a New York-based JetBlue employee for six years. Her lawyer said she is also a full-time nursing student. She surrendered to U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents in New York on March 23, the same day she was charged in Los Angeles with possession with intent to distribute cocaine. The drug discovery was made March 18 in Terminal Four by a Transportation Security Administration security officer who was screening the airline attendants carry-on bags as part of a random search, according to an FBI affidavit. As the TSA officer led Reynolds to a location to be searched, she made a cellphone call -- speaking in what sounded like a foreign language -- then kicked off her shoes and ran from the terminal down the up escalator, the affidavit said. The agent didnt pursue because his primary concern was the bags Reynolds was carrying and airport police who conducted a search for Reynolds couldnt find her, authorities said. Reynolds abandoned luggage was found to contain 11 individually wrapped packages -- labeled Big Ranch -- that were taken to the Los Angeles polices Forensic Science Division, where the contents tested positive for cocaine.

650,"A $500,000 bond was set Thursday for a JetBlue Airways flight attendant who fled Los Angeles International Airport after security officials pulled her aside for a random baggage search and later allegedly found nearly 70 pounds of cocaine in her carry-on luggage. Marsha Gay Reynolds, 31, a former Jamaican beauty queen and college track-and-field athlete, was granted bond by a federal magistrate judge in Brooklyn, New York, but remains in custody pending a further hearing Friday, according to the U.S. Attorneys Office. Prosecutors may appeal the decision and argue that Reynolds, a resident of Queens, should stay behind bars pending trial. Reynolds, who was second runner-up in the 2008 Miss Jamaica pageant, allegedly kicked off her Gucci high heels as she ran from LAX last Friday night. She surrendered to U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents in New York on Wednesday, the same day she was charged in Los Angeles with possession with intent to distribute cocaine.

Flight attendants and other crew members are not normally subjected to searches, but this is a perfect example of why Los Angeles airports need 100 percent screening of all passengers and airport employees McClain said. McClain disputed claims that its impossible to screen everyone that comes to work at LAX, pointing out that such screening is done at two prominent Florida airports. Miami International Airport and Orlando International Airport screen all of their employees, McClain said. Miami has screened approximately 38,000 employees since 1999. Total employee screening is realistic and achievable and it should happen here at LAX. Requiring 100 percent screening would raise the odds of stopping an insider or lone wolf terrorist attack and help minimize opportunities for airport employees to commit crimes, according to the police union. The weekends incident reinforces the (unions) calls for an airport police officer to be stationed within 300 feet of the TSA screening checkpoint, McClain said. While airport police officers are charged with patrolling an entire massive airport terminal, having an officer dedicated to being within 300 feet of the security area ensures that an officer is immediately available to respond to issues at the screening station. which is the last line of defense in keeping unwanted items off of planes and ill-willed individuals from getting access to planes, McClain said. --City News Service, photo via Shutterstock",0,8,5
651,"Update at 7:20 p.m. March 23, 2016 LOS ANGELES (CNS) - A JetBlue Airways flight attendant who allegedly had 70 pounds of cocaine in her carry-on luggage and fled from Los Angeles International Airport as security officials began searching her bags has been taken into custody, authorities said Wednesday. Marsha Gay Reynolds, 31, of Jamaica, N.Y., who allegedly kicked off her Gucci high heels as she fled the airport, was charged in federal court with possession with intent to distribute cocaine. She surrendered to the Drug Enforcement Administration at John F. Kennedy Airport on Wednesday evening, FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said. She will appear in federal court in New York before returning to California, Eimiller said. Reynolds is expected to make her initial court appearance tomorrow in United States District Court in Brooklyn. Our nations security depends on every individual with security clearances to honor the trust placed in them, United States Attorney Eileen M. Decker said. The defendants conduct violated that trust and, in the process, exposed the public to a major narcotics transaction and the dangers inherent to such a transaction. The affidavit attached to the complaint obtained by Patch alleges that Reynolds became nervous when she was selected for secondary screening at LAX. She then retrieved a cell phone and made a call to an unknown person in a foreign language before running the wrong way up an escalator out of the airport, leaving her shoes and bags behind. The TSA agent that was escorting Reynolds to the secondary screening did not attempt to pursue her because the luggage she left behind was a safety issue for passengers, according to the complaint. The abandoned luggage was found to contain 11 individually wrapped packages containing almost 70 pounds of cocaine, according to an affidavit.

652,"A Los Angeles City Council committee approved zero tolerance penalties Tuesday that would result in the immediate revocation of a taxi drivers permit to operate at Los Angeles International Airport if he or she were found to have refused rides due to race or other discriminatory reasons. The tougher rules, which will next be considered by the full City Council, were prompted by a complaint in September by former Major League Baseball player Doug Glanville, who said he was refused a ride by a taxi driver at LAX because he is black. Currently, permit revocation occurs after the third offense, while the new rules call for immediate revocation of a drivers permit to provide taxicab service if he or she refuses service based on prejudice against a specific race, nationality, religion, age, disability, sex or gender identity, according to a report by Los Angeles World Airports, which operates LAX. Under the proposed new penalties, informal warnings would be eliminated under the new rules. Refusals of service for other reasons would result in no less than six days suspension from the airport, while discourteous actions could lead to suspensions lasting no less than four days, under the proposed rules. The revisions to the airports penalties for taxi drivers are similar to rules adopted by the Department of Transportation, which issues citywide permits for taxi drivers, according to airport officials. The stricter penalties received the backing today of the Innovation, Grants, Technology, Commerce and Trade Committee, which is chaired by Councilman Bob Blumenfield. Blumenfield, who had introduced a motion to look into discrimination by taxi drivers, said today the incident described by Glanville made my stomach turn. City officials do not appear to agree on whether the taxi drivers actions against Glanville were motivated by race. The driver who refused Glanvilles ride was initially hit with a one- year revocation of his permit, but this revocation was downgraded to two weeks after the driver appealed to the Department of Transportation saying that he refused service not because of Glanvilles race, but because the trip was too short and would have result in lower fares. The revised penalties approved by the committee would replace existing enforcement rules included in an agreement with Authorized Taxicab Supervision, Inc., an outside company that manages taxi dispatch and taxi stands for LAX. The Innovation, Grants, Technology, Commerce and Trade Committee also requested that airport officials consider similar rules that would apply to the taxi companies themselves -- not just the drivers -- and for ride-hailing companies. Airport officials told the panel today they found gaps in their enforcement process while investigating Glanvilles complaint. They also said all taxi drivers at the airport have been instructed to undergo diversity training. Airport police also conducted an undercover operation in November with two black officers hailing trips from taxi drivers. Out of 25 requests made, they were refused five times, airport officials told the committee. A couple of the refusals may have been because the trips were too short, but there were some cases in which taxi drivers refused giving rides before knowing the destination, airport officials said. Blumenfield said he was shocked by the refusals, which he said pointed to a problem of racial discrimination among taxi drivers at LAX. Blumenfield spokesman Jason Levin told City News Service he was not sure if any sting operations using control groups such as white undercover officers had also been done as a comparison. Additional undercover operations have been conducted since the initial one in November, according to airport officials. --City News Service",0,8,5
653,"A JetBlue Airways flight attendant accused of trying to smuggle nearly 60 pounds of cocaine in her carry-on luggage and fleeing when she was pulled aside for a random baggage search at Los Angeles International Airport pleaded not guilty Friday to a federal charge. Marsha Gay Reynolds, 31, entered her plea before a U.S. magistrate judge to a single count of possession with intent to distribute cocaine. The felony charge is punishable by a 10-year mandatory minimum prison term, according to the U.S. Attorneys Office. A status conference in the case is set for May 9 before U.S. District Judge Christina Snyder, but a May 31 trial date will likely be postponed. Reynolds, of Queens, New York, sprinted down an up escalator and out of LAX, leaving behind her luggage, after she was randomly selected for secondary screening, prosecutors allege. The following day, she worked a JetBlue flight back to New York and surrendered to U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents there on March 23, according to Assistant U.S. Attorney Reema M. El-Amamy. At a previous hearing in downtown Los Angeles, Reynolds was ordered held without bail pending trial. A former beauty pageant contestant in Jamaica, Reynolds has been a New York-based JetBlue employee for six years. Her lawyer said she was also a nursing student, but has withdrawn from school. The alleged drug discovery was made March 18 in Terminal 4 by a Transportation Security Administration security officer who was screening the airline attendants carry-on bags as part of a random search, according to an FBI affidavit. As the TSA officer led Reynolds to a location to be searched, she made a cellphone call -- speaking in what sounded like a foreign language -- then kicked off her Gucci high heels and ran from the terminal down the up escalator, the affidavit says. Upon being notified she was going to secondary screening, she appeared nervous and kept her distance from the supervisor, U.S. District Judge Andre Birotte said at an April 8 bail review hearing. And before the bags were even open, she utilized her track skills to flee from the airport, the judge said. Prosecutors allege Reynolds abandoned luggage was found to contain 11 individually wrapped packages -- labeled Big Ranch -- that were taken to the Los Angeles polices Forensic Science Division, where the contents tested positive for cocaine. It takes a very bold criminal to run through the airport -- and come back the next day and flee the district, El-Amamy said.

654,"By FRED SHUSTER City News Service A British gay porn star busted at Los Angeles International Airport after he was found attempting to smuggle a half-pound of crystal meth in his body pleaded guilty today to a federal drug possession charge. Philip Gizzie -- who uses the stage name Bruno Knight -- was arrested June 16 after he told LAX customs officers that he had inserted three large objects containing methamphetamine into his body cavity, according to an affidavit filed in support of the criminal complaint. Gizzie, 31, pleaded guilty today to a federal count of possession with intent to distribute meth, which carries a 20-year maximum sentence, prosecutors said. An attorney for Gizzie could not be reached for comment. According to the affidavit, Gizzie was scheduled to depart LAX on a flight to London after what he described as a weekend of partying with friends in North Hollywood. Acting on an anonymous tip to the Drug Enforcement Administration, customs officials located Gizzie -- who had no checked luggage -- and began questioning him, according to court documents. Gizzie, appearing nervous and sweating profusely, told officers that he had taken meth, marijuana, cocaine and the narcotic sedative known as GHB over the weekend but was not high at the moment, the affidavit said. During a secondary inspection, Gizzie told officers that he was carrying three packets of meth in his body. Gizzie expelled two of these objects at LAX and passed the third object at Centinela Hospital, the affidavit states, describing the weight of the drugs as 226 grams. Describing himself as an HIV-positive porn actor and male escort, Gizzie said he had left London three days earlier with his partner, a Virgin Atlantic flight attendant. Gizzie has worked for several gay porn studios. In a scene from the 2011 porno film Security Control, Gizzie plays an airport security guard who searches another porn actors body for drugs. Gizzie is being held in federal custody pending sentencing on Nov. 24 before U.S. District Judge Manuel Real.   PHOTO Patch file photo.",0,8,5

657,"A federal judge in Oakland agreed today to release on $500,000 bond the widow of a man who shot and killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Florida last year. U.S. Magistrate Judge Donna Ryu said federal prosecutors failed to convince her that Noor Salman, 30, is a flight risk or a threat to the community. However, Ryu granted prosecutors a 48-hour stay so that they can appeal her ruling to the Middle District Court of Florida, which has jurisdiction in the case. The Florida court has the right to come to a different decision, Ryu said. That means the earliest that Salman could be released to the custody of her uncle, Abdallah Salman, who lives in Rodeo, is 11 a.m. on Friday. Ryu said Noor Salmans bond is secured by the $500,000 in equity that her uncle has in his house plus the $525,000 in equity that her mother, Ekbal Salman, has in her house, which also is in Rodeo. Salman, who was dressed in a red jail jumpsuit and wore her hair in braids at her packed hearing today, is accused of aiding and abetting her husband, Omar Mateen, in providing support to a foreign terrorist organization, namely, the Islamic State, in the attack at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando on June 12. Salman is also accused of obstructing justice by misleading local police and the FBI when she was questioned in the hours following the attack. Along with the 49 killed, 53 other people were injured in the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. Mateen died in a shootout with police. Salman was arrested in January at her mothers house in Rodeo, where she and her 4-year-old son had been living since September. Ryu said she believes the weight of the governments evidence against Salman is debatable at this time. Prosecutor Sara Sweeney alleged at a previous hearing that at the end of 16 hours of interrogation by FBI agents that began on June 12, Salman admitted she was aware that her husband left their home on June 11 with a rifle and a backpack full of ammunition and allegedly said she knew he was going to commit an attack. Sweeney also alleged that Salman was aware that Mateen was watching a Islamic State recruiting video, accompanied him on three trips to case possible shooting sites and was with him when he bought ammunition. But Ryu said what Sweeney described as Salmans alleged admissions were made at the end of a lengthy interrogation at which she wasnt represented by a lawyer and those statements might not be admissible in a trial. Ryu also said Salmans attorneys have argued that Salman was the victim of domestic abuse and a psychological evaluation shows that she suffers from cognitive deterioration that impairs her abstract thinking. Orlando Police Chief John Mina said in a statement that hes disappointed that Ryu plans to release Salman on bond. Mina said, Nothing can ease the pain we all feel about the senseless and brutal murders of 49 of our neighbors, friends, family members and loved ones. Mina added, But I have full faith that she will ultimately be brought to justice and I remain grateful to federal authorities who worked tirelessly on this case for months to see that some measure of justice be served in this act of terror that has affected our community so deeply. Charles Swift, one of Salmans lawyers, said Ryus ruling is a just, equitable decision that allows her to be reunited with her family. Another defense attorney, Linda Moreno, said shes glad that Ryu is allowing Salman to be released on bond, saying, Its extremely rare for so-called terrorists to be released on bond. Moreno said she believes Ryus decision is a statement on the weakness of the governments case against Salman. Moreno said Salman wants to be home and see her 4-year-old son. Swift said court officials decided it would be better that Salman be housed with her uncle at his Rodeo home instead of with her mother because her uncle speaks better English and has been the family member who has been communicating with federal authorities. Ryu said Salman has strong family support and has no prior criminal record. She is one of four daughters in a family of Palestinian descent, was born in the U.S. and primarily grew up in the East Bay. Salmans lawyers said that after she was divorced from her abusive first husband, she met Mateen on an online dating site and moved with him to Fort Pierce, Florida, when they married. If the Florida court doesnt reverse her ruling, Ryu said Salman will essentially be under house arrest for now because she wont be allowed to leave her uncles house except for when she meets with her lawyers or has to go to court and will have to wear a GPS monitor. Ryu also said Salman must participate in mental health treatment and cant renew her passport, which has expired. Ryu scheduled a status conference hearing for Salman for March 9 in Oakland. --Bay City News/Pulse shooting scene image via Orlando police",1,2,0
658,"- A second suspect has been arrested in the November shooting death of 28-year-old William Sims at a bar in El Sobrante, according to Contra Costa County Sheriffs deputies. Ray Simons, 32, of Hercules (on the right in the above photo), was arrested in Monterey County where he allegedly gave a false name during the booking process. His real identity was determined using fingerprints, and Contra Costa County homicide detectives were notified of his arrest on Saturday, according to sheriffs spokesman Jimmy Lee. Simons is being held without bail on suspicion of murder, robbery, shooting at a person from a vehicle and intimidating a witness. Daniel Porter-Kelly, 31, was arrested Nov. 16 and charged with one count of felony murder, one count of robbery and is facing a hate-crime enhancement for Simss killing. Porter-Kelly pleaded not guilty to the charges on Nov. 28 in Contra Costa County Superior Court. Sims is African-American but prosecutors did not explain exactly why they felt Porter-Kelly should be charged with a hate crime, citing the ongoing investigation. Police are still seeking one other suspect, 31-year-old Daniel Ortega (on the left in the above photo), a resident of either Novato or Richmond. Police say Simons, Porter-Kelly and Ortega killed Sims after some sort of altercation at the Capri Club on Appian Way. Sims cousin launched a GoFundMe campaign, William Sims, Jr Memorial Fund, to raise funds to cover unanticipated expenses associated with his murder. Will was a gifted and talented musician, he was gentle, kind-hearted, caring and loved by his family and friends.

659,"PHOTOS: Murder victim William Sims; arrested suspect Daniel Porter-Kelly. Suspects from East and North bays sought: Daniel Ortega; Ray Simons. ----- The man charged in an El Sobrante hate crime killing pleaded not guilty Monday during his first court appearance, at which his lawyer complained that prosecutors are not providing him with vital documents that could aid the mans defense. Daniel Porter-Kelly, 31, was arrested Nov. 16 by Contra Costa County sheriffs deputies in the shooting death of 28-year-old William Sims. Porter-Kelly is charged with one count of felony murder and one count of robbery and is facing a hate-crime enhancement involving the race of the victim, according to the district attorneys office. Sims is African-American but prosecutors did not explain exactly why they felt Porter-Kelly should be charged with a hate crime, citing the ongoing investigation. Deputies are still searching for two other suspects in the case, 32-year-old Ray Simons of Hercules and 31-year-old Daniel Ortega, a resident of either Novato or Richmond. Porter-Kellys lawyer, Colin Cooper, said hes outraged that prosecutors have yet to provide him with any law enforcement reports, witness statements or an arrest warrant, a process called discovery in legal circles. Its an absolute outrage and a violation of the Constitution, Cooper said. You cant charge somebody with murder and have your detectives going on social media and news shows telling people its a hate crime without (giving the defense access to those documents). The prosecution, however, is adamant that the search for the other suspects in the case takes priority over writing the types of reports Cooper is demanding. Coopers claims of Constitutional violations are offensive, said Deputy District Attorney Derek Butts. (Investigators) made an arrest, they are looking for two other guys, Butts said. They dont have time to sit at their desks to satisfy Mr. Cooper. Butts said its not super unusual that prosecutors would make court filings in a criminal case prior to the discovery process. Just after 2 a.m. on Nov. 12, a sheriffs sergeant who was on patrol in El Sobrante discovered Sims lying in the roadway near Appian Way and Garden Road and suffering from a gunshot wound. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Sims, a musician and retail worker, had no known gang ties and no criminal history, according to the sheriffs office. Detectives believe that Sims was at the nearby Capri Club when some kind of altercation occurred. Porter-Kelly is being held at the Martinez Detention Facility without bail. He is expected to appear at his preliminary hearing on Dec. 9. While he could have faced the death penalty for the crimes hes accused of, prosecutors are seeking a maximum penalty of life in prison, Butts said. During the investigation, sheriffs deputies arrested Ortegas mother on suspicion of interfering with the investigation. Shes been identified as Renee Brown, 54, of Novato and was being held on $500,000 bail, according to the sheriffs office. Sims cousin launched a GoFundMe campaign, William Sims, Jr Memorial Fund, to raise funds to cover unanticipated expenses associated with his murder. Will was a gifted and talented musician, he was gentle, kind-hearted, caring and loved by his family and friends.

660,"Richmond Mayor Tom Butt released a statement Saturday saying he is saddened and distressed as details emerge in an allegedly racially motivated fatal shooting against a Richmond resident earlier this month in El Sobrante. The victims cousin expressed her familys pain at the loss of 28-year-old William Sims, saying on a memorial page, His life was taken by three individuals who targeted and murdered Will for no other reason than the color of his skin. ... There are NO WORDS for this senseless killing. Around 2:10 a.m. on Nov. 12, a sheriffs sergeant was on patrol in El Sobrante and discovered Sims lying in the roadway near Appian Way and Garden Lane and suffering from a gunshot wound. Sims was pronounced dead at the scene. As we work to strengthen our city by bringing people together, we must acknowledge heinous acts of hatred, hostility and violence that occur in our community and nation as a whole, Butt said. Though Mr. Sims death occurred outside of Richmond city limits in the nearby unincorporated community of El Sobrante, his passing has left our community stunned and seeking justice for a young man who will be remembered as a talented musician and a kind-hearted member of our community, he said. I am appreciative of the response from law enforcement, which has led to the arrest of one suspect, and I hope that the remaining suspects are apprehended and brought to justice expeditiously, the mayor said. Contra Costa County sheriffs officials said on Tuesday that deputies had arrested one man and are seeking two others in connection with Sims death. Detectives believe that Sims was at the Capri Club in the 4100 block of Appian Way when some kind of altercation occurred. Sims, a musician and retail worker, had no known gang ties and no criminal history, according to the sheriffs office. Daniel Porter-Kelly, 31, was arrested last week and is facing murder and robbery charges in addition to a hate crime enhancement for the shooting. Contra Costa County prosecutors and sheriffs officials did not elaborate on the nature of the alleged hate crime, citing the ongoing investigation, but the mayors office today described the shooting as racially motivated. Deputies are still looking for two other suspects. Theyve been identified as 32-year-old Ray Simons of Hercules and 31-year-old Daniel Ortega, a resident of either Novato or Richmond, sheriffs officials said. During the investigation, sheriffs deputies arrested Ortegas mother on suspicion of interfering with the investigation. Shes been identified as Renee Brown, 54, of Novato and is being held on $500,000 bail, according to the sheriffs office. Butt added, I urge Richmond residents to maintain our citys values of respect and care for one another, especially during a time when we are experiencing a nationwide surge in hate-filled hostility and threats to public safety. Racism, bigotry, discrimination and all other forms of hatred and oppression have no place in our city. My office is committed to working with law enforcement along with local, state and federal representatives to ensure that we remain progressive in fostering an inclusive society and ensuring public safety for all, the mayor said. I offer my deepest condolences to the family and friends of William Sims and hope all who knew him can find comfort during this unimaginably difficult time, Butt said. Porter-Kelly is being held at the county jail without bail. Hes scheduled to be arraigned at the George D. Carroll Courthouse in Richmond on Monday, prosecutors said. Sims cousin launched a GoFundMe campaign, William Sims, Jr Memorial Fund, to raise funds to cover unanticipated expenses associated with his murder. Will was a gifted and talented musician, he was gentle, kind-hearted, caring and loved by his family and friends. We have a missing link in our world today, she wrote on the website, adding, This world we live is in need of love today. The only way to win over hate is by love. The memorial, as of this morning, has raised $6,120 toward its $15,000 goal. Anyone with information regarding the whereabouts of Ortega and Simons is asked to contact the Contra Costa County Sheriffs Office at (925) 646-2441. The two suspects are considered armed and dangerous and anyone who spots them should not approach them, according to the sheriffs office. --Bay City News contributed to this report/Images of Sims courtesy of GoFundMe effort",1,0,0
661,"Two men accused of attacking a Sikh resident of Richmond are being charged with a hate crime by the Contra Costa County District Attorneys office. Chase Little and Colton Leblanc are accused of beating Maan Singh Khalsa and him attacking with a knife on the night of Sept. 25 as Khalsa was sitting alone in his car at a stoplight. During the attack, the men allegedly forced Khalsas head down, knocked off his turban and cut his hair with a knife, according to the district attorneys office. Mr. Khalsas actual or perceived race/ethnicity, religion and nationality was a substantial factor in the vicious assault, District Attorney Mark Peterson said in a statement. The savage cutting of Mr. Khalsas unshorn hair, a sacred article of his faith, constitutes a hate crime under the law. Both men were charged with assault and assault with a deadly weapon, with prosecutors adding the enhancements of a hate crime and infliction of great bodily injury. The men allegedly attacked Khalsa at about 9 a.m. when he was stopped at a red light near the Hilltop Mall in Richmond on his way home from work. The two were in a pickup truck along with three other people when it pulled up next to Khalsa and someone from the truck began throwing beer cans at Khalsas car, according to the district attorneys office. Khalsa called 911 to report the harassment, but at the next stoplight, Leblanc and Little jumped out of the truck, ran to Khalsas car and began punching him through the open window. They knocked his turban off, grabbed him by the hair and, while yelling obscenities, cut his hair with a knife, according to prosecutors.  The attack left Khalsa with a battered and bruised face, several damaged teeth and a serious knife wound to his hand that will require the amputation of his pinky finger, prosecutors said. The other men in the pickup truck, including Dustin Albarado, did not physically attack Khalsa and have not been charged. Little and Leblanc are contractors from Texas who were working for the Chevron Richmond Refinery. Both men were since fired, according to a statement from Chevron. Little, who has a court date on Nov. 21, is out on bail and a warrant has been issued for Leblanc, according to prosecutors. Also see: --Bay City News/Shutterstock image",1,3,0
662,"Jury selection in a case involving a confrontation with BART police is on hold while San Francisco Public Defender Jeff Adachi fights to remove the assigned judge from the case. Adachi filed a motion on Sept. 16 seeking to remove Judge Anne-Christine Massullo from the case of Michael Smith, a 22-year-old man charged with misdemeanor battery on a police officer and misdemeanor resisting arrest. Smith was arrested in connection with a July 29 incident at San Franciscos Embarcadero BART station that prompted an outcry after bystander videos circulated showing BART police officers struggling with him and punching him in the head while he was pinned on his stomach. BART police later said they were responding to a 911 call reporting an attempted robbery that included a detailed description of the suspect. They allege that Smith physically resisted when officers tried to detain him, kicking one officer in the head and throat, biting another and spitting on a third. No robbery charge was filed, however, because the man who made the call later said no weapon had been displayed, according to police. The case is expected to be one of the first in San Francisco to make use of officer body camera footage, with both sides seeking to argue that it favors their interpretation of events. Adachi, who is trying the case himself, has argued that the case is an example of racial profiling, in that his client was treated like a terrorist by police on the basis of an uncorroborated report of a robbery, which may in turn have been inspired by a racially charged confrontation with another rider on a BART train. In that incident, a man on the train had allegedly yelled at Smiths girlfriend, telling her she smelled bad and calling her derogatory names. Smith, who was accompanying his pregnant girlfriend to a doctors appointment, told the man to stop talking to her like that before moving away, according to Adachi. The public defender filed his motion seeking to remove Massullo, a former prosecutor, after she refused to allow the defense to present witnesses to the events leading up to Smiths arrest or to present expert witnesses, although prosecutors will be allowed to present the 911 call that led to the police response. The motion argues that the judge has shown consistent bias against the defense, behaved discourteously and refused to allow the defense to question jurors about their views on matters relating to racial bias, even ordering Adachi not to mention Oscar Grant or Black Lives Matter. Can you imagine if we go to try the case if we cant talk about anything that happened before? Adachi said today. I mean Ive never heard anything like it. We just want a fair judge, thats all. Massullo filed a response denying the allegations on Sept. 26, and Adachi filed a supplement to the motion on Sept. 27 in which more than half a dozen other defense attorneys added their personal experiences with Massullo allegedly displaying bias in court. A response by the state Judicial Council appointing a judge to address Adachis motion was expected by midnight Monday night, according to Adachi. --Bay City News/Shutterstock image",1,0,0
663,"Laws to protect Californians from DUI offenders, help establish an earthquake early warning system, reform the California Public Utilities Commission, increase oversight of building contractors, require police to securely stow any handgun left in a car, improve tour bus safety, crack down on water-guzzling households, and more take effect on January 1. The new laws are the result of 17 bills that were introduced by Senator Jerry Hill, passed by the Legislature and signed by Governor Jerry Brown in 2016. Here are summaries of the bills that led to the new laws and what they do: Senate Bill 24 – JPA Pension Fix for San Mateo County Resolves a pension problem that prevented the cities of San Mateo, Belmont and Foster City from completing their Joint Powers Agreement for shared fire service. It allows the three cities to provide the JPA employees a defined benefit plan that those employees received as classic CalPERS members from their previous employment with the cities. San Mateo County Firefighters and the California Professional Firefighters supported SB 24, along with the cities of San Mateo, Belmont and Foster City. SB 62 – California Public Utilities Commission Office of the Safety Advocate Establishes the Office of the Safety Advocate within the California Public Utilities Commission to advocate for continuous, cost-effective improvement of safety management and safety performance of public utilities. SB 438 – Earthquake Early Warning Implementation Complements the $10 million included in the 2016-2017 budget for the statewide earthquake early warning system by establishing the Earthquake Early Warning Advisory Board within the Governors Office of Emergency Services. The new law brings California closer to statewide implementation of the earthquake early warning system. In emergencies, the alerts sent by the warning system will help prevent devastating and life-threatening missteps. Governor Browns announcement of his signing the bill is here and view video of the press conference held at the Office of Emergency Services headquarters here. SB 465 – Building Construction Contractors: Discipline, Reporting and Building Standards SB 465 is aimed at increasing oversight of contractors by closing the gaps in information that were revealed by the collapse of a balcony at a Berkeley apartment building on June 16, 2015. Ashley Donohoe, 22, of Rohnert Park, her cousin, Olivia Burke, 21, of Ireland, and four of their friends were killed. Seven other students from Ireland, including Aoife Beary who had been celebrating her 21st birthday, were hospitalized for weeks after the balcony gave way and sent them plummeting five stories to the ground. Aoife Beary, her mother Angela, Ashley Donohoes mother, Jackie, and representatives of the Irish Consulate testified to policy committees in the Capitol about the devastating loss felt by families from California to Ireland – and urged legislators to support SB 465, which was co-authored by Senator Loni Hancock, D-Oakland. The new law: SB 512 – Governance, Accountability and Transparency at the California Public Utilities Commission SB 512 reforms the governance structure of the California Public Utilities Commission by more clearly outlining the roles and responsibilities of commissioners and staff, and by requiring the CPUC to reach out to communities affected by CPUC decisions, instead of only to regulated utilities. To do so, SB 512 makes the following statutory changes: It 1) requires the commission to annually approve performance criteria for the commission and the executive director, and to annually evaluate the performance of the executive director based on those criteria; 2) requires the CPUC to reach out to those affected by its proceedings; 3) requires CPUC judges to adhere to ethics provisions of the Administrative Procedures Act; 4) allows the public to receive hearing transcripts at no charge; 5) permits the CPUC to meet in locations other than San Francisco; 6) requires the CPUC to modify its annual report to clarify how long the CPUC takes to finish rate or penalty cases; and 7) allows local governments to receive intervenor compensation when participating in CPUC efforts to improve safety, enabling local governments that have suffered catastrophes to seek such compensation. SB 661 – The Dig Safe Act of 2016 SB 661 addresses safety problems involving excavations and gas pipelines that are beneath soil or are otherwise underground by making clarifications to the so-called one-call law (Call 811 before you dig) and by creating the Safe Excavation Board, an appointed board of excavation stakeholders that is funded by fees on utilities. The board is to 1) investigate accidents and other one-call violations; 2) develop standards for safe excavation; and 3) coordinate education and outreach efforts. SB 812 – Improving Tour Bus Safety Improves the safety and oversight of tour buses operating in California by strengthening the California Highway Patrols tour bus inspection program. The law was prompted by a tour bus accident in San Franciscos Union Square in November 2015 that injured 20 people, at least five critically. After the crash, the CHP determined that the bus had never been inspected and was not registered with the California Public Utilities Commission, as is required by law. The CHP later conducted a surprise inspection of the companys bus fleet and found over 60 violations, 29 for mechanical problems. SB 814 – Cracking Down on Water-Guzzling Households During a Drought A winner of Senator Hills 2016 Oughta Be a Law…Or Not bill idea contest for constituents, SB 814 pulls the plug on excessive water use by households that flout mandatory reductions during drought emergencies. The law requires urban retail water suppliers to set rules for identifying and cracking down on households that consume enormous amounts of water despite restrictions imposed during a statewide declaration of a drought. The new law ensures that every urban retail water supplier has a tool to curb excessive water use by customers. Households that guzzle water – while neighbors and most other Californians abide by mandatory reductions – will no longer be able to hide and persist in their excess. SB 869 – Safe Storage of Police Handguns in Vehicles Another winner of Senator Hills 2016 Oughta Be a Law… contest, SB 869 responds to numerous thefts of handguns that law enforcement officers had left in cars. The stolen firearms included guns used in two murders in the Bay Area. SB 869 closes a legal loophole that had exempted law enforcement officers as well as concealed weapons permit holders from requirements to securely stow handguns in a lockbox out of plain view, or in the trunk, if the weapons are left in an unattended vehicle. SB 996 – Affordable Housing Property Tax Cap Aids local nonprofit and religious organizations that provide affordable housing by increasing the assessed property value exemption from $2,000,000 annually to $10,000,000 annually. The new law applies to three local nonprofits, such as the Saint Francis Center in Redwood City and the Ministry Services of the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul based in Los Altos Hills, which provides housing, food and clothing services to low-income families. SB 996 provides property tax relief to such organizations so that they can continue to provide more affordable housing for low income people and families. SB 1004 – Young Adult Offender Pilot Program Hailed by Governor Brown for its innovation, SB 1004 authorizes a pilot program in five counties, including Santa Clara, to give nonviolent young adult offenders between the ages of 18 and 21 the opportunity to take advantage of supportive and educational services in the juvenile justice system, rather than serve their time in an adult county jail. Although legally considered adults, these young offenders are still undergoing significant brain development, and may be better served by the juvenile justice system with age-appropriate, intensive services. Research shows that people do not develop adult-caliber, decision-making skills until their early 20s. Psychologists note that this maturity gap makes young adults more likely to engage in risk-seeking behavior. SB 1028 – Utility Wildfire Mitigation Plans SB 1028 requires 1) utilities regulated by the California Public Utilities Commission to file wildfire mitigation plans, 2) the CPUC to review those plans, and 3) publicly-owned utilities to also file wildfire mitigation plans with their governing boards. SB 1039 – Business and Professions Omnibus Bill SB 1039 makes several changes to the statutes governing various boards and bureaus under the Department of Consumer Affairs; includes specified fee increases for several boards including the Dental Hygiene Committee of California, the California Board of Optometry, the Board of Registered Nursing, the Board of Pharmacy, and the Contractors State License Board; and eliminates the Telephone Medical Advice Services Bureau. SB 1039 specifies that the continuing education standards established for nurses by the Board of Registered Nursing shall recognize specialized areas of practice, as previously required, and require that content be relevant to the practice of nursing, be related to the scientific knowledge or technical skills required for the practice of nursing, or be related to direct or indirect patient or client care. The legislation requires the nursing board to audit continuing education providers at least once every five years to ensure adherence to regulatory requirements. The new law also requires the board to withhold or rescind approval from any provider that is in violation of the regulatory requirements. SB 1046 – Ignition Interlock Devices for Drunk Driving Offenders Extends a pilot program requiring drunk driving offenders in Alameda, Los Angeles, Sacramento and Tulare counties to install the devices known as IIDs. IIDs are calibrated to the driver and prevent a car from starting if the driver is not sober. The four-county pilot would run until January 1, 2019, when the program would be expanded statewide with minor modifications so that: SB 1046 also creates an early incentive program, providing DUI offenders with full driving privileges soon after arrest if they install an IID. Their ultimate IID time requirement would be reduced based on when the early installation occurred. Low income offenders would be eligible for assistance to pay for an IID based on a sliding scale pegged to household income. SB 1192 – Private Post-Secondary Education SB 1192 changes the California Private Post-Secondary Education Act of 2009 to improve the effectiveness of the Bureau for Private Post-Secondary Education and opportunities for student success, and extends the BPPEs operations for four years. SB 1193 – Healing Arts, Board of Pharmacy, Veterinary Medical Board Sunset Bill SB 1193 makes changes to the Pharmacy Law, Veterinary Practice Act and Psychology Licensing Law to strengthen the laws and improve oversight of licensees by these boards. SB 1196 – Professions and Vocations: Bureau of Real Estate, Bureau of Real Estate Appraisers, and Bureau of Security and Investigative Services Bill SB 1196 ensures that the Bureau of Security and Investigative Services is subject to review by the appropriate policy committees of the Legislature. The legislation changes provisions in the Alarm Company Act, the Locksmith Act, the Private Investigator Act, the Private Security Services Act, Proprietary Security Services Act, and Collateral Recovery Act to improve the oversight, enforcement and regulation of licensees by the bureau. The bill also adds a sunset review date for the Bureau of Real Estate and the Bureau of Real Estate Appraisers, and changes existing laws to improve oversight, enforcement and regulation by the CalBRE and BREA. SB 1196 includes several consumer protection and public safety reforms to operations and oversight by the Bureau of Security and Investigative Services, which licenses about 380,000 companies and employees that provide alarm services, locksmith services, private investigation, private security, repossession services and firearm and baton training. The changes are intended to ensure that an applicant for licensure as an armed security guard is capable of exercising appropriate judgment, restraint and self-control; that armed security guards are qualified for their jobs, and that California regulators step up their policing of the industry. SB 1196 also imposes stricter training standards and requirements to ensure that shootings and incidents of suspected excessive force are investigated. In addition, the new law enables gun permits to be revoked when warranted and improves oversight of companies. – SUBMITTED FOR PUBLICATION BY: Office of State Senator Jerry Hill / Image via Shutterstock",0,8,5
664,"A onetime Menlo Park man was sentenced this week to seven decades in federal prison for traveling repeatedly to Cambodia to molest impoverished children, four of whom testified to grueling sexual attacks that had jurors holding back tears. Ronald John Boyajian was found guilty in March of federal counts of international travel with intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct with minors, engaging in illicit sexual conduct with a minor in foreign places, and commission of a felony offense involving a minor while required to register as a sex offender. Boyajian — who was previously convicted more than 20 years ago on nearly two dozen counts of statutory rape in Orange County — declined to participate in his sentencing hearing, telling the court he was unprepared to go forward. Calling Boyajians crimes extremely, extremely serious, U.S. District Judge Christina Snyder imposed the 70-year sentence, ordering lifetime supervised release and mandatory sex offender registration if he is ever released from federal prison. Boyajian, acting as his own attorney, kept the case at a stalemate for seven years prior to the start of the six-week trial in Los Angeles. The case docket has more than 1,500 entries, most of them motions filed almost daily by Boyajian in which he objected to each aspect of the proceedings and accused the judge of conspiring against him behind the scenes. His latest attempt to delay sentencing was denied late last week by Snyder. Federal cases are very complex, especially when there are international aspects and witnesses from abroad, Eileen M. Decker, the U.S. attorney in Los Angeles, told City News Service. We expect these cases to take many years. We are in a unique situation to do this. If we do not address this terrible crime, we fear it would go unpunished. Three women in their 20s, who were children when they were sexually assaulted by the defendant, gave brief victim impact statements last week, telling the judge that the attacks had lasting, painful impacts on their lives. Speaking through a translator, one of the women urged the judge not to allow this man to leave prison because possibly there are other children out there that it could happen to — just like it happened to me. Crying, she said, I dont want this to happen to other children. I want other children to have a happy life. Another woman told the court that since she was attacked by Boyajian more than seven years ago, she fears men and often finds herself grouchy for no reason. Boyajian, 55, who has lived in Menlo Park and the Palos Verdes area, was sentenced to 30-year terms for each of the two travel offenses and 10 years for committing the offenses while being required by California law to register as a sex offender. It took a federal jury about five hours before returning guilty verdicts on all three counts contained in a federal indictment handed down in September 2009. This case is about a man who wanted to sexually assault children — and he found a place where he could do that, Assistant U.S. Attorney Vanessa Baehr-Jones told the jury at the start of the trial. Boyajian was arrested by the Cambodian National Police in February 2009 while on his 35th trip to Asia over a nine-year period. Boyajian began traveling to Cambodia — one of Southeast Asias poorest countries — shortly after completing his parole following convictions in Orange County for illegal sex with a minor and oral sex with a minor in 1994. Federal prosecutors presented evidence the defendant sexually assaulted girls who were between 8 and 11. One victim, who was 8 when she was molested, testified that he was cruel — he treated me like I wasnt even human. Boyajian paid pimps and sometimes the victims relatives to have access to the children. The attacks took place in the village of Svay Pak — known as Kilo 11 because it is located 11 kilometers outside of Cambodias capital city of Phnom Penh — where the victims were Vietnamese immigrants who lived in the poor community. A Cambodian police anti-human trafficking officer testified that Svay Pak was notorious as a place where foreigners went to have sexual contact with young girls. Boyajian went to Svay Pak to have unlimited access, prosecutors said. One of the females he assaulted — now an adult working in Cambodia to help fellow victims of predators — told jurors that Boyajian paid her grandmother to leave her alone with him in a wooden shack. She described being raped, beaten and bitten on the legs and calves by the defendant during multiple attacks. Boyajian was among the first defendants charged under an international law enforcement initiative specifically targeting Americans traveling to Cambodia for the purpose of sexually abusing children. Operation Twisted Traveler was an effort by the Justice Department and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to crack down on sex tourism. Boyajian has been in custody in Los Angeles since his removal from Cambodia seven years ago. In the years since he was charged, Boyajian lodged a raft of motions and continuances, ensuring the case remained deadlocked. In the minutes before the jury was called into the courtroom for opening statements on Feb. 3, Boyajian made a motion to have Snyder removed from the case. Following the verdicts, the defendant immediately filed motions objecting to the jurys racial mix, among other complaints. The investigation of Boyajian was begun by the Cambodian non-governmental organization Action Pour Les Enfants — APLE — whose investigators said they witnessed Boyajian visiting a child brothel in Svay Pak. It was here — halfway across the world — that foreigners like the defendant could freely target children who were being sold into prostitution, Baehr-Jones told the jury. Boyajian was charged under the Protect Act, which became law in 2003 and made it easier for U.S. authorities to prosecute people for overseas sex crimes. Federal authorities have made more than 70 arrests under the act in countries including Cambodia, Thailand and the Philippines. – By Fred Shuster, City News Service.",1,8,0
665,"- A petition circulating online is calling for the removal of a Santa Clara County Superior Court judge who organizers say gave a lenient sentence to a former Stanford University swimmer convicted of sexually assaulting a woman last year. Judge Aaron Persky sentenced Brock Allen Turner, 20, to six months in county jail for the assault during a fraternity party at the private college on Jan. 18, 2015. Turner received the sentence during a hearing Thursday at the Palo Alto Courthouse. Turner was convicted in March of three felony counts of rape of an unconscious person, digital penetration with an unconscious person and assault with the intent to commit rape. As of Wednesday morning, more than 584,000 supporters people have signed the appeal on Change.org to remove Persky over Turners sentence. The page calls on people to file a complaint in court alleging appearance of bias toward a particular class, based on Perskys sentence for Turner. Judge Persky failed to see that the fact that Brock Turner is a white male star athlete at a prestigious university does not entitle him to leniency, the petition states. The sentence failed to send the message that sexual assault is against the law regardless of social class, race, gender or other factors, the petition states. The petition can be viewed online at this link. According to The Daily Beast, Judge Persky once boasted of his toughness against sex crimes: I became a criminal prosecutor for the Santa Clara County District Attorneys Office, where I now prosecute sex crimes and hate crimes, he wrote in a biography for the California League of Women Voters when he was running for a judgeship in 2002. I focus on the prosecution of sexually violent predators, working to keep the most dangerous sex offenders in custody in mental hospitals. Persky likely figured that his résumé would go over well with women, but he nonetheless lost the election to a fellow prosecutor. He was appointed to the bench the following year by then Gov. Gray Davis. The judge is unable to comment on the matter because Turner is appealing the case, court officials said. Santa Clara County District Attorney Jeff Rosen said in a statement Monday that the judge should not be removed from his position. While I strongly disagree with the sentence that Judge Persky issued in the Brock Turner case I do not believe he should be removed from his judgeship, Rosen said. The victim read a statement during Thursdays sentencing hearing that in part read, You took away my worth, my privacy, my energy, my time, my intimacy, my confidence, my own voice, until today. Also on Patch: The woman went on to say, The damage is done, no one can undo it. And now we both have a choice. We can let this destroy us, I can remain angry and hurt and you can be in denial, or we can face it head on, I accept the pain, you accept the punishment, and we move on. The full written statement by the victim has been shared widely on social media in the days after the hearing, increasing attention on the case. I am so pleased that the victims powerful and true statements about the devastation of campus sexual assault are being heard across our nation. She has given voice to thousands of sexual assault survivors, Rosen said. The assault happened on campus outside the Kappa Alpha house where two passersby saw Turner having sex with a woman who appeared to be unconscious. The woman was taken to Santa Clara Valley Medical Center in San Jose, where she woke up later in the morning and told investigators she was drinking outside the home and couldnt remember anything after midnight. Turner told investigators he and the woman met at the party, kissed outside on the ground and had sex that he thought was consensual. The ex-star swimmer also informed investigators that he consumed alcohol, which included seven beers and some whiskey, during the party but was conscious during the intercourse. Turner is from Dayton, Ohio, and withdrew from Stanford University after charges were filed against him last year. -Bay City News",0,8,5

667,"Social equity has been a top priority for the County of Marin for many years, and the Board of Supervisors emphasized its importance again after the Marin community expressed concerns about the changing immigration policy in Washington, D.C. At its March 21 meeting, the Board passed a resolution supporting family unity, community security, dignity and due process for all residents of Marin. It was brought forth in light of recent shifts in federal immigration policy, including executive orders signed by the new administration that have created a climate of fear and uncertainty among immigrant communities nationwide, including our own, as noted in the resolution.With its 22 departments, the County government serves an estimated 16,000 undocumented immigrants, or about 6 percent of the population. Just four months ago, the Supervisors affirmed with a resolution that equity and inclusion are priorities of the County of Marin, and it takes a stand against all forms of discrimination and intolerance. Fostering a relationship of trust, respect and open communication between County employees and County residents, regardless of immigration status, is essential to the Countys core mission of ensuring the heath, well-being and public safety for our entire community, the new resolution reads. Our Board wants to ensure that eligible individuals are able to seek services from the County without regard to immigration status, said Board President Judy Arnold. This reaffirms our commitment to initiatives that build inclusive and equitable communities. I believe this resolution is an affirmation of our promise to stand in the gap with the community and law enforcement for those we serve. The Marin County Office of the Public Defender maintains an Immigrant Resource Toolkit, also in English and Spanish, to help inform residents of their rights. The Marin County District Attorney also recently instituted a Hate Crime Hotline at 415-473-2585 to assure that potential hate crime incidents are properly and promptly investigated. In addition to immigrant protections, the County is making efforts to level the playing field on many fronts in the interest of fairness. In its October 2016 State of the County report, the County chose equity as one of its focal points for 2017. Income disparity in Marin is on the rise, negatively affecting quality of life and even life expectancy for those lower on the socioeconomic scale. The County is dedicated to delivering services to the people who need the help the most, and that often includes recent immigrants. Recent equity efforts include increasing food parity, removing artificial barriers to job recruitment, promoting civil rights, and making open space preserves and parks more accessible to all. The Countys 5 Year Business Plan, approved by the Supervisors in October 2015, focuses on equity and inclusion as the County works to be a more adaptive organization that fosters engagement, learning and leadership. For more than a decade, equity has been one of the Countys guiding goals and official policy guidelines. Equity, education, environment and economy, referred to as the Four Es, which for 10 years as helped prioritize and support a wide variety of County initiatives. — SUBMITTED FOR PUBLICATION BY: County of Marin",0,8,5
668,"SF BAY - San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee has issued a statement regarding a mass shooting that killed at least 50 people early this morning at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, describing it as an evil act of terror. The shooting was first reported by police on Twitter just before 1 a.m. at Pulse nightclub and ended when officers fatally shot the suspected gunman, according to police. In addition to the fatalities, 53 people were sent to the hospital, police said. San Francisco stands in solidarity with the community of Orlando and the nation in the aftermath of this terrible day, Lee said in the statement. This is a stark reminder that violence still threatens our LGBT community. Senseless acts of violence against innocents, fueled by hate and easy access to deadly firearms, have become all-too frequent. We must continue to work each day to reduce gun violence and ensure every community is safe. A vigil will be held this evening at 8 p.m. at Harvey Milk Plaza in San Francisco to honor and remember the victims of the shooting. --Bay City News",1,4,0

SB 438 – Earthquake Early Warning Implementation Complements the $10 million included in the 2016-2017 budget for the statewide earthquake early warning system by establishing the Earthquake Early Warning Advisory Board within the Governors Office of Emergency Services. The new law brings California closer to statewide implementation of the earthquake early warning system. In emergencies, the alerts sent by the warning system will help prevent devastating and life-threatening missteps. Governor Browns announcement of his signing the bill is here and view video of the press conference held at the Office of Emergency Services headquarters here. SB 465 – Building Construction Contractors: Discipline, Reporting and Building Standards SB 465 is aimed at increasing oversight of contractors by closing the gaps in information that were revealed by the collapse of a balcony at a Berkeley apartment building on June 16, 2015. Ashley Donohoe, 22, of Rohnert Park, her cousin, Olivia Burke, 21, of Ireland, and four of their friends were killed. Seven other students from Ireland, including Aoife Beary who had been celebrating her 21st birthday, were hospitalized for weeks after the balcony gave way and sent them plummeting five stories to the ground. Aoife Beary, her mother Angela, Ashley Donohoes mother, Jackie, and representatives of the Irish Consulate testified to policy committees in the Capitol about the devastating loss felt by families from California to Ireland – and urged legislators to support SB 465, which was co-authored by Senator Loni Hancock, D-Oakland. The new law: SB 512 – Governance, Accountability and Transparency at the California Public Utilities Commission SB 512 reforms the governance structure of the California Public Utilities Commission by more clearly outlining the roles and responsibilities of commissioners and staff, and by requiring the CPUC to reach out to communities affected by CPUC decisions, instead of only to regulated utilities. To do so, SB 512 makes the following statutory changes: It 1) requires the commission to annually approve performance criteria for the commission and the executive director, and to annually evaluate the performance of the executive director based on those criteria; 2) requires the CPUC to reach out to those affected by its proceedings; 3) requires CPUC judges to adhere to ethics provisions of the Administrative Procedures Act; 4) allows the public to receive hearing transcripts at no charge; 5) permits the CPUC to meet in locations other than San Francisco; 6) requires the CPUC to modify its annual report to clarify how long the CPUC takes to finish rate or penalty cases; and 7) allows local governments to receive intervenor compensation when participating in CPUC efforts to improve safety, enabling local governments that have suffered catastrophes to seek such compensation. SB 661 – The Dig Safe Act of 2016 SB 661 addresses safety problems involving excavations and gas pipelines that are beneath soil or are otherwise underground by making clarifications to the so-called one-call law (Call 811 before you dig) and by creating the Safe Excavation Board, an appointed board of excavation stakeholders that is funded by fees on utilities. The board is to 1) investigate accidents and other one-call violations; 2) develop standards for safe excavation; and 3) coordinate education and outreach efforts. SB 812 – Improving Tour Bus Safety Improves the safety and oversight of tour buses operating in California by strengthening the California Highway Patrols tour bus inspection program. The law was prompted by a tour bus accident in San Franciscos Union Square in November 2015 that injured 20 people, at least five critically. After the crash, the CHP determined that the bus had never been inspected and was not registered with the California Public Utilities Commission, as is required by law. The CHP later conducted a surprise inspection of the companys bus fleet and found over 60 violations, 29 for mechanical problems. SB 814 – Cracking Down on Water-Guzzling Households During a Drought A winner of Senator Hills 2016 Oughta Be a Law…Or Not bill idea contest for constituents, SB 814 pulls the plug on excessive water use by households that flout mandatory reductions during drought emergencies. The law requires urban retail water suppliers to set rules for identifying and cracking down on households that consume enormous amounts of water despite restrictions imposed during a statewide declaration of a drought. The new law ensures that every urban retail water supplier has a tool to curb excessive water use by customers. Households that guzzle water – while neighbors and most other Californians abide by mandatory reductions – will no longer be able to hide and persist in their excess. SB 869 – Safe Storage of Police Handguns in Vehicles Another winner of Senator Hills 2016 Oughta Be a Law… contest, SB 869 responds to numerous thefts of handguns that law enforcement officers had left in cars. The stolen firearms included guns used in two murders in the Bay Area. SB 869 closes a legal loophole that had exempted law enforcement officers as well as concealed weapons permit holders from requirements to securely stow handguns in a lockbox out of plain view, or in the trunk, if the weapons are left in an unattended vehicle. SB 996 – Affordable Housing Property Tax Cap Aids local nonprofit and religious organizations that provide affordable housing by increasing the assessed property value exemption from $2,000,000 annually to $10,000,000 annually. The new law applies to three local nonprofits, such as the Saint Francis Center in Redwood City and the Ministry Services of the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul based in Los Altos Hills, which provides housing, food and clothing services to low-income families. SB 996 provides property tax relief to such organizations so that they can continue to provide more affordable housing for low income people and families. SB 1004 – Young Adult Offender Pilot Program Hailed by Governor Brown for its innovation, SB 1004 authorizes a pilot program in five counties, including Santa Clara, to give nonviolent young adult offenders between the ages of 18 and 21 the opportunity to take advantage of supportive and educational services in the juvenile justice system, rather than serve their time in an adult county jail. Although legally considered adults, these young offenders are still undergoing significant brain development, and may be better served by the juvenile justice system with age-appropriate, intensive services. Research shows that people do not develop adult-caliber, decision-making skills until their early 20s. Psychologists note that this maturity gap makes young adults more likely to engage in risk-seeking behavior. SB 1028 – Utility Wildfire Mitigation Plans SB 1028 requires 1) utilities regulated by the California Public Utilities Commission to file wildfire mitigation plans, 2) the CPUC to review those plans, and 3) publicly-owned utilities to also file wildfire mitigation plans with their governing boards. SB 1039 – Business and Professions Omnibus Bill SB 1039 makes several changes to the statutes governing various boards and bureaus under the Department of Consumer Affairs; includes specified fee increases for several boards including the Dental Hygiene Committee of California, the California Board of Optometry, the Board of Registered Nursing, the Board of Pharmacy, and the Contractors State License Board; and eliminates the Telephone Medical Advice Services Bureau. SB 1039 specifies that the continuing education standards established for nurses by the Board of Registered Nursing shall recognize specialized areas of practice, as previously required, and require that content be relevant to the practice of nursing, be related to the scientific knowledge or technical skills required for the practice of nursing, or be related to direct or indirect patient or client care. The legislation requires the nursing board to audit continuing education providers at least once every five years to ensure adherence to regulatory requirements. The new law also requires the board to withhold or rescind approval from any provider that is in violation of the regulatory requirements. SB 1046 – Ignition Interlock Devices for Drunk Driving Offenders Extends a pilot program requiring drunk driving offenders in Alameda, Los Angeles, Sacramento and Tulare counties to install the devices known as IIDs. IIDs are calibrated to the driver and prevent a car from starting if the driver is not sober. The four-county pilot would run until January 1, 2019, when the program would be expanded statewide with minor modifications so that: SB 1046 also creates an early incentive program, providing DUI offenders with full driving privileges soon after arrest if they install an IID. Their ultimate IID time requirement would be reduced based on when the early installation occurred. Low income offenders would be eligible for assistance to pay for an IID based on a sliding scale pegged to household income. SB 1192 – Private Post-Secondary Education SB 1192 changes the California Private Post-Secondary Education Act of 2009 to improve the effectiveness of the Bureau for Private Post-Secondary Education and opportunities for student success, and extends the BPPEs operations for four years. SB 1193 – Healing Arts, Board of Pharmacy, Veterinary Medical Board Sunset Bill SB 1193 makes changes to the Pharmacy Law, Veterinary Practice Act and Psychology Licensing Law to strengthen the laws and improve oversight of licensees by these boards. SB 1196 – Professions and Vocations: Bureau of Real Estate, Bureau of Real Estate Appraisers, and Bureau of Security and Investigative Services Bill SB 1196 ensures that the Bureau of Security and Investigative Services is subject to review by the appropriate policy committees of the Legislature. The legislation changes provisions in the Alarm Company Act, the Locksmith Act, the Private Investigator Act, the Private Security Services Act, Proprietary Security Services Act, and Collateral Recovery Act to improve the oversight, enforcement and regulation of licensees by the bureau. The bill also adds a sunset review date for the Bureau of Real Estate and the Bureau of Real Estate Appraisers, and changes existing laws to improve oversight, enforcement and regulation by the CalBRE and BREA. SB 1196 includes several consumer protection and public safety reforms to operations and oversight by the Bureau of Security and Investigative Services, which licenses about 380,000 companies and employees that provide alarm services, locksmith services, private investigation, private security, repossession services and firearm and baton training. The changes are intended to ensure that an applicant for licensure as an armed security guard is capable of exercising appropriate judgment, restraint and self-control; that armed security guards are qualified for their jobs, and that California regulators step up their policing of the industry. SB 1196 also imposes stricter training standards and requirements to ensure that shootings and incidents of suspected excessive force are investigated. In addition, the new law enables gun permits to be revoked when warranted and improves oversight of companies. – SUBMITTED FOR PUBLICATION BY: Office of State Senator Jerry Hill / Image via Shutterstock",0,8,5
670,"A Millbrae man pleaded no contest last week in San Mateo County Superior Court to committing a hate crime in which he called another man a derogatory name before hitting him near a Redwood City gas station the day after the U.S. presidential election, prosecutors said this week. Around 11 p.m. on Nov. 9, Michael Goggins, 34, showed up to the Chevron gas station at 2215 El Camino Real, according to the district attorneys office. Goggins then yelled at an employee Why are you in my country? and accused him of being lazy, prosecutors said. When the employee called police, responding officers found Goggins at a nearby warehouse on Laurel Street. Goggins ignored multiple commands from officers and allegedly tried to bite officers as they were arresting him. After he was arrested, Goggins talked about hitting a Mexican and said aliens were invading the country, according to prosecutors. Officers took Goggins to a hospital, where he was given a psychological evaluation. Following his arrest, police were able to locate another victim. The victim said Goggins had approached him and his friend that day as they were walking on Willow Street. Goggins allegedly said to the victim in Spanish, Im white, Im from here. Where are you from, wetback? He then punched the victim in the chest, prosecutors said. On Wednesday, Goggins pleaded no contest to making felony threats to a police officer and a misdemeanor hate crime for violating a victims civil rights. The no contest plea comes with the condition that he wont serve no more than 120 days in county jail and will be referred for consideration into a mental health program, according to prosecutors. Goggins will appear next in court on Friday for sentencing. He remains in custody on $50,000 bail, prosecutors said. Goggins defense attorney was not immediately available for comment. The hate crime case is one of many reported nationwide following the election of Donald Trump as president. During the campaign, Trump called for a wall to be built between the U.S. and Mexico and threatened to deport millions of undocumented immigrants. ALSO SEE: --Bay City News/Shutterstock image",1,0,0
671,"Santa Clara County officials launched a campaign Tuesday to inform criminal detainees of free alternatives to bail as part of a challenge to safely reduce jail usage. The No Cost Release multi-lingual campaigns message will be spread by video, public access TV, the internet, posters and brochures inside jails and throughout the community. County officials said the effort is part of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundations Safety and Justice Challenge, a nationwide initiative to reduce over-incarceration. Santa Clara County Chief Public Defender Molly ONeal said, In my mind, its long overdue. I think it ought to happen all over the state and all over the country. Free services have been available through the public defenders office since 1965. Pretrial services have been available since 1969, according to Javier Aguirre, the countys director of re-entry services. He said detainees should be screened for pre-trial services. This is the first opportunity for the county to do a comprehensive information campaign in English, Spanish and Vietnamese to inform individuals who have been arrested, inform their families and the public about free pre-trial release alternatives to paying for bail, Aguirre said. The campaigns goal is to tell detainees and people awaiting trial of their free pre-trial release options, rights to free criminal defense attorneys and access to free re-entry services. The MacArthur Foundation awarded Santa Clara County a $50,000 grant to design and test reforms to safely reducing jail usage as well as racial and ethnic inequality in the county justice system. The county is one of 20 jurisdictions to receive a grant. Until now, the only information about commercial bail bonds and private criminal attorneys was available inside county jails. In the past few years, alternatives to bail have become increasingly popular as county officials and others see how hard it is for low-income and homeless detainees to pay bail and get out of jail before trial. ONeal said that jail time jeopardizes a detainees employment, which can lead to homelessness, affects a detainees family and hinders their ability to work with an attorney to defend themselves. ONeal said in a statement that it imposes an artificial incentive to plead guilty in order to get out, regardless of guilt or innocence. Research shows that detainees are more likely to be convicted, less likely to have their charges reduced and more likely to be sentenced to jail or prison, with longer sentences -- even when the seriousness of the charges and their criminal histories are equal -- than defendants who have been released. Detaining someone is also costly for the county. It costs $159 per day to confine someone in jail compared to $15 per day for pre-trial supervision. The countys independent Audit Management Division estimated that between July 1 and December 31, 2011, the county could have saved $31.3 million in detention costs if detainees who were eligible were released on their own recognizance. — Bay City News; Image via Shutterstock",0,8,5
672,"Sheriffs deputies and correctional officers in Santa Clara County will soon be outfitted with body-worn cameras, a decision that the Board of Supervisors made unanimously on Tuesday. An estimated 1,142 officers will eventually wear the cameras, according to Supervisor Joe Simitians office. Simitian first proposed the technology in December 2014, saying that he was motivated by the fatal shooting of Michael Brown by Ferguson, Missouri police Officer Darren Wilson, in August of that year, inspiring widespread protests and sparking a national conversation about racial profiling by law enforcement. We can watch with anguish whats happened in other communities around the country, shake our heads and then move on. Or, we can accept the responsibility to do something, Simitian said in a statement. In September 2015, Simitian proposed an implicit bias training for all law enforcement officers in the county, according to his office. The training program began that December, and so far almost 200 deputies have taken the course. With this additional training, our officers are better equipped to recognize instances in which implicit bias may play a role, and are better able to overcome such bias and perform their duties in a fair and neutral way, Simitian said. A 16-month study conducted in Rialto showed a more than 50 percent reduction in use of force by police wearing cameras, and an almost 90 percent drop in civilian complaints of police misconduct, according to Simitians office. The decision comes almost a year and a half after three guards at the Santa Clara County Jail allegedly beat a mentally ill inmate to death in August 2015. The three guards are now facing murder and assault charges.I think cameras can protect the public against officer misconduct, protect the officers against unfounded allegations and help restore trust and confidence in law enforcement and public institutions generally, Simitian said. Simitian also plans to propose a system of civilian oversight of law enforcement. That proposal will come to the board in June, according to his office. — Bay City News; Image via Shutterstock",0,8,5

674,"Former mixed martial arts fighter Jason Mayhem Miller, who is on trial on domestic violence charges, testified Monday that his girlfriend, who he had trained, attacked him on several occasions and that he went to great lengths to avoid responding. The 36-year-old Mission Viejo resident recalled one conflict in which he said his accuser, Anna Stabile, hurled a bottle at him. I dont know what it was all about, said Miller, who sported a mohawk haircut punctuated with a purple streak of dye. The bottle missed its mark, but, I thought it was going to break my TV when she winged it at me, Miller said. It messed up the drywall a little bit. On another occasion, a dispute led Stabile to jump on the former champion fighters back, he testified. He said that conflict came sometime in between that knife thing when Stabile allegedly threatened to take her own life but then lunged at him. She chased me out the back door, ripped off my shirt and jumped on my back and choked me, Miller testified. Asked how a much-smaller woman could attack a professional fighter, Miller responded, I didnt want to fight her... I just figured I was better off getting out of the situation than engage with a physical thing with her. I taught her how to do that choke, he said, but Stabile got sloppy with her legs as she tried to take him down and slipped off, bumping her head on concrete, the fighter testified. I asked her did she want to go to the hospital because it was a good fall, he said. I was shocked that she took it to that level. Miller said Stabile was strong for a girl, and he trained her because I could see her doing big things. When Stabile declined a trip to the hospital, she kinda begged me back... I dont know. We slept together. It was weird, he said. Another time, Miller said something snarky and walked away from Stabile, prompting her to hit me in the back of the head, he testified. Miller also testified about his social media posts on Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat and YouTube. He acknowledged posting a public apology to Stabile after she accused him of domestic violence. Man, I was so hurt that the media was making this thing out to be a huge deal, making me feel like the bad guy, Miller said of his post. I knew she kept doing these things and I kept taking her back. I felt horrible about it. When his attorney, Cameron Talley, asked Miller if he still loved Stabile at the time, the fighter replied, Yeah ... I kept pushing her buttons. Miller said he convinced Stabile the stay in the relationship despite his desire to sleep with other women.I knew she wasnt OK with it, even though she said she was, Miller testified. Miller said he had paid an attorney to help keep Stabile from losing a custody battle for her son and was shocked when she accused him of beating her, after which he tried to take his case to prosecutors. I went in to the District Attorneys Office in Harbor Court to tell them this is wrong, Miller testified. I told them shes trying to ruin my life... They stonewalled me... I said, This is messed up. This didnt happen. She attacked me. The staff at the District Attorneys Office just looked at me funny, Miller said. Talley asked him if the response could have had something to do with his wardrobe that day.Yeah, I was wearing a feather boa, Miller testified, eliciting chuckles in the courtroom. I felt fancy... It was so ridiculous. Thats what it deserved. Talley also showed jurors some of Millers social media posts, which the fighter described as his art and a sharing of his voyage to his fans. In one post, he put jars of Nutella in front of a statue of the Hindu god Ganesh. I like religious imagery. Its Ganesh, the creator and its a reminder not to eat too much Nutella, Miller said. You cant eat that all the time. Youll gain weight. Orange County Superior Court Judge Steven Bromberg last week granted a motion from Talley to drop a stalking charge against Miller. He faces up to five years and 10 months behind bars if convicted of two felony counts of domestic violence and a misdemeanor count of violating a restraining order -- all stemming from incidents that allegedly occurred in 2013.

675,"By A 21-year-old resident of Orange who pleaded guilty to attempting to help Islamic State terrorists in Syria had planned to use a charity as a cover to gain easier access into the civil war-torn country, an FBI agent testified today. Federal prosecutors requested an evidentiary hearing to show U.S. District Judge James Selna how much planning and sophistication went into Adam Dandachs efforts to aid Islamic State terrorists in Syria. Defense attorney Pal Lengyel-Leahu tried to make the case that Dandachs attempts were fumbling at best and included a desire to help refugees. Dandach, who pleaded guilty last August, is set to be sentenced July 25. He faces up to 25 years in federal prison, but prosecutors have not publicly revealed how much time they think he should spend behind bars. FBI Special Agent Scott Wales testified that Dandach was receiving Social Security disability payments and sought advice online whether it was OK under Sharia Law to keep receiving the money, even though his initial disability was no longer an issue, because he did not wish to get a job and pay taxes to the government. The reason why Dandach was placed on disability has not been released publicly. But his attorney mentioned during todays hearing that his client told investigators that he had gastric bypass surgery at one point and struggled with dehydration issues. Wales also testified that the defendant had a gym membership and would often walk there or to the bus and did not appear to have any physical disabilities. Dandach would use social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter to keep abreast of news on the Syrian struggle via reports from Islamic State insiders, Wales testified. He also used an application to solicit advice from apparent associates of Islamic State and participated in discussions in an online forum, Wales testified. According to Wales, Dandach asked one Canadian citizen who had gone to Syria to join the fight to unseat Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, How did you do it? Within a day of that conversation, Dandach had bought a laptop and applied for a passport to replace the one his mother threw away when she feared he would go to Syria, Wales testified. Under questioning from Lengyel-Leahu, Wales testified that Dandachs mother told investigators her son wanted to go to London in December 2013 and join a group that goes to Syria to deliver aid to civilians and the countrys refugees. That prompted her to toss the passport, she told investigators. When investigators searched four digital devices belonging to Dandach such as the laptop and his smart phone, they found he had amassed information on how to travel to Syria, including the advice to join a charity to provide cover so travelers would receive less scrutiny, Wales testified. The way in was through Turkey, where he would look for Islamic State sympathizers, Wales testified. Dandach had pamphlets that included photos of dead, smiling martyrs, who were happy, the propagandists explained, because they had begun to see paradise, Wales testified. Prosecutors showed the judge video of Dandachs interrogation after he was detained at John Wayne Airport, where his passport was confiscated, showing the defendant calmly explaining how the beheading of prisoners of war is OK under Sharia Law and how he figured he would receive weapons training when he got to Syria. Dandach at one point wrote in one of his online conversations, I wish to fight one day, Wales testified. Dandach was arrested a day after his detention at the Orange County airport, and he was heard in a recorded phone call from the Santa Ana jail telling family members to destroy evidence on his digital devices because it could incriminate him and others, Wales testified. Dandach also wrote a letter to an Orange County Register reporter in January 2015 after the deadly terrorist attacks on the Charlie Hebdo journals offices in Paris. The letter includes a poem with a line declaring, je suis Al Qaeda, or Im Al Qaeda. Dandach had a ticket to Atlanta when he was detained at the Santa Ana airport on July 2, 2014. He planned to catch an international flight to Istanbul. Lengyel-Leahu got Wales to acknowledge that Islamic State was not yet on the terrorist watch list when Dandach was planning to go to Syria following the call from religious leaders to Muslims to join the revolution in Syria. Islamic States forerunner, ISIL or ISIS, which was a government-recognized terrorist group, had declared a caliphate on June 29, 2014, that created Islamic State. Dandach was attempting to get insider information about the situation in Syria by following various sources on Facebook and Twitter, not necessarily because he agreed with those individuals opinions on the war, Lengyel-Leahu said. The attorney asked Wales if Dandach was just parroting Sharia Law when he said beheadings were OK, and was not necessarily condoning the practice. When Dandach was detained at the airport, Lengyel-Leahu said, the defendant had no plan, no route (into Syria), no forms of communication on him. Wales agreed with that statement. He did not even have any money on him, Lengyel-Leahu said. Lengyel-Leahu also attacked Wales testimony that Dandach planned to pledge allegiance to Islamic State when he got to Syria. The attorney aimed to point out that even someone working for a charity would have to do that under Sharia Law. Lengyel-Leahu also questioned Wales testimony about Dandachs belief that bloodshed would be necessary to oust Bashard, pointing out that President Thomas Jefferson backed the French Revolution, which included executions at guillotines of the monarchys supporters. You wouldnt call Thomas Jefferson a terrorist, would you? Lengyel- Leahu asked. Dandach told investigators he would not be able to fight because of his disability, and when agents asked him if he could be a driver or do some other non-combat tasks, the defendant replied others could do those activities, according to Lengyel-Leahu. Assistant U.S. Attorney Annamartine Salick asked Wales if there was any evidence that Dandach had done any charity work at home or researched how to do charity work in Syria. Not that Im aware of, Wales replied. City News Service",0,8,5
676,"The Laguna Niguel stabbing death of a 22-year-old man is not considered a hate crime despite claims by the victims loved ones that the killing was racially motivated. Craig Matthew Tanber, a 37-year-old member of a prominent Orange County white supremacist gang has been charged with murder in the fatal stabbing of Shayan Mazroei at Patsys Irish Pub in Laguna Niguel on the Sept. 8. At a vigil outside Mazroies home, friends and loved ones lamented the senselessness of the tragedy, calling it an act of racism. It wasnt supposed to happen, Mazroies girlfriend Madelyn Leggard told KTLA. It was a racist act, and this isnt the type of thing that should happen to a 22-year-old kid. George Hansell, who was at Patsys Irish Pub on the night of the stabbing said he heard a friend of Tanber complaining about Mazroie, who often played pool at the pub. The woman said, I dont like that guy. Im like, which guy, and she said That Iranian. I dont want to use the word that she said, Hansell told KTLA. According to investigators, the Tanber and Mazroei went outside to fight over a girl. By all accounts (the victim) was in the wrong place at the wrong time, said Senior Deputy District Attorney Larry Yellin. A friend of Tanbers apparently said something rude to the victim, prompting a response from him that angered the defendant, Yellin said. Tanber then allegedly punched and stabbed Mazroei twice in the upper chest area, Yellin said. Authorities say they have no evidence that race was a factor in the attack despite claims by Mazroies loved ones that he was the victim of racial malice. If evidence surfaced that race was a motive in the stabbing, charges could be amended to include a hate crime, but Right now there is no evidence to support that, said Susan Kang Schroeder, chief of staff at the Orange County District Attorneys Office. Tanber is charged with murder with sentencing enhancements for the personal use of a knife and prior strike convictions. Prior to the stabbing, he was on parole for the April 4, 2004 beating death of 26-year-old Cory Lamons in Huntington Beach. Tanber pleaded guilty Feb. 2, 2007 to voluntary manslaughter and admitted sentencing enhancements for doing so to benefit a street gang, according to court records. He also pleaded guilty to dissuading a witness by force, street terrorism and assault with a deadly weapon or force likely to produce great bodily injury. Tanber was sentenced to 13 years in prison. He also has prior strike convictions for residential burglary in 2001, and he is accused of serving a prison term for one year or more and not remaining free for more than five years. Tanber is scheduled to be arraigned Oct. 2. His bail remains at $1 million. City News Service contributed to this report. Photo: Justice for Shayan Mazroei Facebook page.",1,0,0
677,"The following is a collection of weekly police, court and fire stories from around the Monrovia area this week. An astute resident helped investigators capture a man suspected of starting a fire that engulfed a historic Victorian home in Pasadena. Dozens were evacuated and two were treated for injuries at the scene when a fire broke out on the 6th floor of a senior living facility. The motive for the killing of man found with multiple gunshot wounds was unknown, and no suspects have been identified, police said. Sheriff Jim McDonnell announced an investigation into secret department gangs revealed by a deputy who admitted to belonging to one. When police arrested a man wanted for rape and murder in New York, he was allegedly holding another woman against her will in Los Angeles.

678,"- A former Catholic high school teacher who says he was stripped of his job in 2013 for marrying his gay partner soon after the Supreme Court made same-sex marriage legal can take his lawsuit to trial, a Los Angeles judge ruled Monday. Superior Court Judge Monica Bachner rejected arguments by lawyers for St. Lucys Priory High School in Glendora that there were no triable issues in the case brought by Kenneth Bencomo. Defense attorney Brenda Ligorsky said the decision will be reviewed for a possible appeal. Bencomo and his husband, Christopher Persky, were one of the first gay couples to marry on July 1, 2013, after a U.S. Supreme Court decision cleared the way for same-sex marriages to resume in California. Bencomo, now 49, sued St. Lucys in March 2014, alleging wrongful termination in violation of public policy, violation of the state Labor Code and breach of contract. Attorneys for the school maintained that the lawsuit should have been dismissed on grounds that the school was founded by a Catholic-affiliated organization and has immunity from Bencomos claims under the ministerial exception, which precludes claims of employment discrimination against a religious institution that are brought by its ministers. In her ruling, Bachner said it was beyond dispute that St. Lucys ... is a religious organization that clear falls within the ministerial exception and that the school prides itself on being a Catholic high school founded by a Catholic religious order. Plaintiff was aware that St. Lucys was a religious school, Bachner wrote. No reasonable jury can find otherwise. However, Bencomo produced substantial evidence through his course records that he did not teach any religious classes, but instead taught studio art, dance, English and yearbook and magazine courses. (St. Lucys) never required that faith or religion be used in the classes taught by (Bencomo) because he was not in the religious department, Bachner wrote. Furthermore, (Bencomo) never personally led prayers. In his teachings, (he) never relied on or referenced Catholicism. The judge also said St. Lucys knew Bencomo had a gay partner who regularly attended school events and had been introduced by the plaintiff to other teachers and to nuns, undermining the schools argument that he had reason to believe he was violating his employment contract with his same-sex marriage. Bencomo was raised Catholic and graduated from Damien High School, a Catholic all-male school in La Verne. He began teaching at St. Lucys in 1998. -- City News Service, photo via Shutterstock",1,4,3
679,"- Police are investigating the weekend vandalism of two West Covina churches as probable hate crimes, and are working Monday to determine if the same suspect was involved in both cases. Security cameras showed graffiti being spray-painted on statues and other areas of St. Christopher Catholic Church, 629 S. Glendora Ave., shortly before 4 a.m. Saturday, said West Covina police Cpl. Rudy Lopez. The video showed a masked man dressed in dark clothing spray-painting graffiti on the grounds of the church, including on a statue of the patron saint, St. Christopher, and the Virgin Mary. Among graffiti were references to various Biblical verses and the phrase bow down to Jehovah, Lopez said. Also vandalized some time over the weekend was nearby West Covina Christian Church, which had the words Jehovah lives spray-painted on its sign. No arrests have been made. The vandalism is regarded as a felony because of the amount of damage, but no specific estimate was released. Im a church-going man myself, and I see this and I am offended by it, Lopez said in remarks broadcast on Fox11. Why someone feels that they have a right to do something like this is beyond me. -- City News Service, photo via Shutterstock",1,3,2
680,"- Postal inspectors on Wednesday arrested a Monrovia woman on federal charges of assaulting a mail carrier, who allegedly was subjected to racial epithets and then pepper-sprayed in the face. Ruby Guerrero Valenzuela, 64, allegedly carried out the road rage-related assault on the U.S. Postal Service employee on April 20 in Pasadena, according to the U.S. Attorneys Office. Valenzuela was expected to make her initial appearance late this afternoon before a federal judge in Los Angeles. According to an affidavit in support of the criminal complaint, Valenzuela apparently believed that the mail carrier, whose name was withheld, had cut her off at an intersection in Pasadena. She then shouted obscenities and followed the carrier to her next stop, where Valenzuela ran up to the victim, who had gotten out of her vehicle and walked to the entrance of a building on Lake Avenue, prosecutors allege. According to witnesses, Valenzuela screamed additional obscenities and racial epithets at the victim before spraying the mail carrier in the face with pepper spray, which caused her to suffer severe pain and blurred vision, federal prosecutors said. The evidence in this case indicates that a postal carrier carrying out her duties was the victim of an unwarranted attack, said U.S. Attorney Eileen M. Decker. All federal employees should be able to carry out their duties without fear of attacks based on the performance of those duties. The charge of assaulting a federal employee in a manner that inflicts bodily injury carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in federal prison. --City News Service, photo courtesy of the USPS",1,0,0
681,"This article was revised on Monday, Feb. 2 to reflect new information: Murder, attempted murder and two hit-and-run charges were filed today against rap mogul Marion Suge Knight, who could face up to life in prison if convicted. Earlier today, a commissioner revoked Knights $2 million bail. Knight, 49, surrendered early Friday and was booked on suspicion of murder for allegedly running over two men with his truck in Compton on Thursday afternoon, killing one of them, and fleeing the scene. Knights bail status was amended -- his bail had been set at $2 million - - because he was deemed a possible flight risk and three-strikes candidate. According to a sheriffs statement, possible witness intimidation issues and a criminal past were also factors. Knight is scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday at the Compton courthouse. The complaint includes an allegation that he committed a serious and violent felony while out on bail in an unrelated robbery case, as well as use of a deadly weapon and causing great bodily injury allegations. Knight has prior convictions, making this a third-strike case, according to the complaint. The hit-and-run occurred around 2:55 p.m. Thursday in the parking lot of Tams Burgers in the 1200 block of West Rosecrans Avenue, near Central Avenue. Knight allegedly drove his pickup truck backward and forward, killing Terry Carter, 55, and injuring 51-year-old Cle Stone, who was treated at a hospital. Knights attorney, James Blatt, confirmed his client was behind the wheel of the pickup that struck the men, but said he acted out of fear in trying to escape as many as four people who attacked him. Blatt also claimed that Knight had been unaware that he had hit two men with the pickup, which was later found in a Westwood parking lot. Lt. John Corina, a sheriffs homicide detective, told reporters late last week that investigators believe Knight intentionally struck the men and that he was not acting out of a reasonable fear. Corina said Knight had gotten into an argument at a film shoot for a promotional video for Straight Out of Compton, a biopic of the Compton rap group N.W.A. Knight, and was told to leave. The argument resumed about 20 minutes later at the eatery about three miles away. Corina alleged the 51-year-old victim exchanged punches with Knight through the open window of his truck before the rapper intentionally ran him over, then struck Carter -- who had been standing next to Stone -- while accelerating forward. Knights lawyer described Carter as a friend of his clients, and Corina said the victim was not believed to have been involved in the altercation with Knight. The web site TMZ.com reported that surveillance cameras at the Tams Burgers crime scene were broken and that cameras at a nearby bank, drug store and a competing fast-food outlet were pointing away from the crime scene. Sheriffs deputies, however, have said they have video of the dispute. Knight is awaiting trial on a robbery charge stemming from the alleged theft of a camera from a paparazzo in Beverly Hills last September. He is charged in that case, along with comedian Micah Katt Williams, and faces up to 30 years to life in prison if convicted in the robbery case. Knight co-founded Death Row Records, which in its heyday in the early 1990s was generating revenues of about $100 million per year. He helped launch some of raps biggest acts, including Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg and Tupac Shakur, and was with Shakur the night he was slain in 1996. Knight served five years in prison for assault and federal weapons violations and, after his release in 2001, spent another 10 months behind bars for violating parole by hitting a Hollywood nightclub valet. He was shot a half-dozen times last August at a Los Angeles-area nightclub. No arrests have been made in that case. --City News Service Also on Patch Delta Will Fly Larger Planes on Shuttle From LAX to San San Diego State University Sending Wine Program Abroad Suspected Sex Workers.

682,"The following is a collection of weekly police, court and fire stories from around the Montrose-La Crescenta area this week. An astute resident helped investigators capture a man suspected of starting a fire that engulfed a historic Victorian home in Pasadena. Dozens were evacuated and two were treated for injuries at the scene when a fire broke out on the 6th floor of a senior living facility. The motive for the killing of man found with multiple gunshot wounds was unknown, and no suspects have been identified, police said. Sheriff Jim McDonnell announced an investigation into secret department gangs revealed by a deputy who admitted to belonging to one. When police arrested a man wanted for rape and murder in New York, he was allegedly holding another woman against her will in Los Angeles. The 22-year-old was arrested just hours after the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Florida that left 49 people and the gunman dead. Police officers were sent around 3:30 a.m. to Trumps star, which is located near Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue.

683,"By City News Service The California Supreme Court refused Wednesday to review the case against a former Sunland resident convicted of first-degree murder for acting as the getaway driver for a gang member who gunned down a black man in Canoga Park because of his race. Martin Sotelo was convicted in April 2011 in connection with the killing of James Shamp. Last October, a three-justice panel from Californias 2nd District Court of Appeal rejected the defenses contention that there was insufficient evidence to support Sotelos April 2011 conviction and the special circumstance finding that Shamp was killed because of his race. Shamp, who was a week shy of his 49th birthday, was shot on Dec. 22, 2008, while taking a trash bag to a bin outside his workplace at the Canoga Park Bowl. Sotelo also was convicted of one count each of evading an officer, along with the attempted robbery of a separate victim shortly before the attack on Shamp. Jurors also found true the special circumstance that Shamp was killed during a drive-by killing, along with an allegation that the crimes were committed for the benefit of a criminal street gang. Co-defendant Richard Bordelon -- formerly of Reseda -- pleaded guilty in March 2009 to first-degree murder and other charges, and admitted that he had personally discharged a firearm. Bordelon used a racial epithet to refer to Shamp before the killing, according to the appellate court panels 18-page ruling. Appellant (Sotelo) did not leave after the first shot but drove away with Bordelon only after Bordelon finished shooting. Appellant offered no assistance to Shamp, who had fallen mortally wounded, the appellate court justices found in their Oct. 2 ruling. The justices noted that Sotelo was driving the car during the police chase that ensued, concluding that it was conduct evidencing consciousness of guilt. After the car crashed, appellant fled on foot and removed his shirt, additional consciousness of guilt evidence, according to the panel. Sotelo and Bordelon are each serving life prison terms without the possibility of parole.",1,0,0
684,"Richmond Mayor Tom Butt released a statement Saturday saying he is saddened and distressed as details emerge in an allegedly racially motivated fatal shooting against a Richmond resident earlier this month in El Sobrante. The victims cousin expressed her familys pain at the loss of 28-year-old William Sims, saying on a memorial page, His life was taken by three individuals who targeted and murdered Will for no other reason than the color of his skin. ...there are NO WORDS for this senseless killing. Around 2:10 a.m. on Nov. 12, a sheriffs sergeant was on patrol in El Sobrante and discovered Sims lying in the roadway near Appian Way and Garden Lane and suffering from a gunshot wound. Sims was pronounced dead at the scene. As we work to strengthen our city by bringing people together, we must acknowledge heinous acts of hatred, hostility and violence that occur in our community and nation as a whole, Butt said. Though Mr. Sims death occurred outside of Richmond city limits in the nearby unincorporated community of El Sobrante, his passing has left our community stunned and seeking justice for a young man who will be remembered as a talented musician and a kind-hearted member of our community, he said. I am appreciative of the response from law enforcement, which has led to the arrest of one suspect, and I hope that the remaining suspects are apprehended and brought to justice expeditiously, the mayor said. Contra Costa County sheriffs officials said on Tuesday that deputies had arrested one man and are seeking two others in connection with Sims death. Detectives believe that Sims was at the Capri Club in the 4100 block of Appian Way when some kind of altercation occurred. Sims, a musician and retail worker, had no known gang ties and no criminal history, according to the sheriffs office. Daniel Porter-Kelly, 31, was arrested last week and is facing murder and robbery charges in addition to a hate crime enhancement for the shooting. Contra Costa County prosecutors and sheriffs officials did not elaborate on the nature of the alleged hate crime, citing the ongoing investigation, but the mayors office today described the shooting as racially motivated. Deputies are still looking for two other suspects. Theyve been identified as 32-year-old Ray Simons of Hercules and 31-year-old Daniel Ortega, a resident of either Novato or Richmond, sheriffs officials said. During the investigation, sheriffs deputies arrested Ortegas mother on suspicion of interfering with the investigation. Shes been identified as Renee Brown, 54, of Novato and is being held on $500,000 bail, according to the sheriffs office. Butt added, I urge Richmond residents to maintain our citys values of respect and care for one another, especially during a time when we are experiencing a nationwide surge in hate-filled hostility and threats to public safety. Racism, bigotry, discrimination and all other forms of hatred and oppression have no place in our city. My office is committed to working with law enforcement along with local, state and federal representatives to ensure that we remain progressive in fostering an inclusive society and ensuring public safety for all, the mayor said. I offer my deepest condolences to the family and friends of William Sims and hope all who knew him can find comfort during this unimaginably difficult time, Butt said. Porter-Kelly is being held at the county jail without bail. Hes scheduled to be arraigned at the George D. Carroll Courthouse in Richmond on Monday, prosecutors said. Anyone with information regarding the whereabouts of Ortega and Simons is asked to contact the Contra Costa County Sheriffs Office at (925) 646-2441. The two suspects are considered armed and dangerous and anyone who spots them should not approach them, according to the sheriffs office. Sims cousin launched a GoFundMe campaign, William Sims, Jr Memorial Fund, to raise funds to cover unanticipated expenses associated with his murder. Will was a gifted and talented musician, he was gentle, kind-hearted, caring and loved by his family and friends. We have a missing link in our world today, she wrote on the website, adding, This world we live is in need of love today. The only way to win over hate is by love. The memorial, as of this morning, has raised $6,120 toward its $15,000 goal. --Bay City News contributed to this report/Images of Sims courtesy of GoFundMe effort",1,0,0
685,"A Wildomar man pleaded guilty Monday to sexually assaulting a 15-year-old Murrieta girl who desperately wanted to be part of the local music scene. Michael John Garza, 36, was sentenced to 364 days in jail after his victim, now 16 years old, told a judge in gut-wrenching, graphic detail that the military veteran, music teacher and father of three, lured her to his house, showed her his arsenal of weapons, forced her to have oral sex and raped her. I woke up on Labor Day and lifted myself off the green towel that he made me sleep on so that I would not secrete on his bedsheets, the girl said in court. On my left was a trusted adult in my community that had committed the unthinkable. Twice. Garza, clad in a black pants, shirt and vest with striped sneakers with his long hair pulled into a ponytail, didnt look up as the girl testified. The morning after the assault Garza undressed the victim and used a cloth to wash her in the shower, the girl testified. Lifting my arms by the wrist and scrubbing my armpit, he told me that it was like bathing his daughters, the victim told Judge Jerome E. Brock in a silenced courtroom. The girls parents wept as their daughter — who cut her hair short and stopped wearing makeup to prevent herself from being seen as attractive by men — read from a powerful prepared victim impact statement outlining Garzas actions. (Read the full statement below) She told Patch that Garza sent her a Facebook message in September 2017 inviting her to have sushi with other local musicians, but on the night of the gathering took her to his house instead where she was assaulted. He went into his room, so Im just standing there in the living room looking around, trying not to touch anything, she recalled. There was cat vomit, cat poop and it is just disgusting and I hate it... And hes like Hey come here real quick ... and hes naked.  Victim Impact Statement Read June 18, 2018 At Michael John Garzas Sentencing Hearing In Murrieta, CA by BanningBeaumontPatch on Scribd  The girl had met Garza at an open mic in June 2017 and he later befriended her on social media, she said. Garza was a member of her voice instructors band. He used social media to reach out and gain her trust, the victims mom who asked to remain anonymous to protect her daughters identity, said. He continued to correspond and groom her over the next couple months. Garza was arrested on Sept. 22, and charged with a dozen felony counts including rape by force, compelling an act of oral copulation by force, sexual penetration with bodily injuries on a minor and sexual penetration with a foreign object, court records show. He was kicked out of his band immediately but posted $500,000 bail and continued to circle the Temecula Valley music scene, appearing in Mr. Krinkle: A Primus Tribute Project, according to the victims family and social media posts. Garza agreed to a year in jail in exchange for pleading guilty to two felony counts of oral copulation on a minor and lewd acts on a child. With good behavior, Garza could be released before the end of the year. Hes going to be out by Christmas, the victims mother said. Hell be hanging Christmas lights with his kids. In the courthouse hallway before the sentencing hearing, Garza laughed and joked about the good time he had had an a party the night before. Garza posted details about the gathering on Facebook, thanking friends for an epic and fitting farewell at his studio. Yes, I will unfortunately be away for a while … Ill see you all sooooooon, the post said. In a reply to a comment from someone who said hope alls OK, Garza wrote, It will be brutha. Just gotta handle some shit. Ill be back!!! I promise.  The victims parents told Patch they werent happy with the plea agreement. Prosecutors did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the case. You can steal away somebody elses precious little girl and do something so heinous, and you can have farewell parties, the girls mother said.. Its like weve been silenced and hushed out the back door, rushed into this shitty deal. The victims parent said they moved from the area after the girl was assaulted. The girls mother said her daughter was treated poorly when rumors swirled about the assault, and there were no news reports about Garzas arrest. This is why girls dont say anything, the girl said. There are just so many repercussions for the victim when they come out and tell people [what happened to them]. The teen said she was forced to sit in silence while Garza lived a life of normalcy and she withdrew from her passion of singing because even her voice teacher didnt want to be associated with her anymore. In her testimony, the victim told the judge she was asked not to come back to the music school shed attended for three years after she told some fellow students what had happened to her. I remember thinking, Why? Its my story to tell. It felt as if the whole community was aiming to silence me, she said. Though Garza did not teach the victim at the school and only worked there for a couple of months, the teen felt her musical home had been ripped from her. The schools owner where Garza taught drum lessons said he was shocked and saddened to learn of the allegations against Garza, who was fired immediately after his arrest. Judge Brock called the girls testimony incredibly articulate and compelling. Unfortunately when people are victimized by crimes… usually with these cases, especially with these cases, they appear as nothing more than a name on of a piece of paper... but thats not right, the judge said. Judge Brock sentenced Garza to a three-year suspended sentence, five years probation and 364 days in jail. Garza must register as a sex offender for life, enroll in a state-certified sexual offender management program, engage in no unauthorized contact with minors and have no contact with the victim. He was immediately taken into custody. -- Main image by Renee Schiavone / Booking photo courtesy Riverside County Sheriffs Department",0,8,5
686,"A Perris couple accused of holding their 13 children, half of them adults, captive in inhumane conditions -- even shackled to furniture -- were charged Thursday with more than three dozen felonies, including torture, child abuse and false imprisonment. The victims reported that, as punishment, they were tied up with ropes. One of them was hogtied. The (defendants) chained the victims to their beds, Riverside County District Attorney Mike Hestrin said during a briefing in downtown Riverside to announce the filing of charges. This went on for weeks and months at a time. David Allen Turpin, 56, and his wife, Louise Ann Turpin, 49, were charged with 12 counts each of torture and false imprisonment, as well as six counts of child abuse and seven counts of cruelty to a dependent adult. David Turpin, a former aerospace engineer, is additionally charged with one count of lewd acts on a child under 14 years old. They pleaded not guilty during an arraignment before Superior Court Judge Michael Donner, who scheduled a felony settlement conference for Feb. 23 at the Riverside Hall of Justice. Prosecutors successfully argued for each defendants bail to be hiked to $12 million -- up from $9 million apiece. Theyre both being held at the Robert Presley Jail in Riverside and are facing 94 years to life in state prison if convicted. Hestrin characterized the alleged mistreatment inflicted by the pair as horrific, describing how the 13 victims endured severe neglect that intensified over time. All of the victims are severely malnourished, the district attorney said. The 29-year-old female (victim) weighs 82 pounds. They were fed very little on a schedule. According to Hestrin, the alleged prolonged harm to the victims and their captivity left them physically and cognitively damaged. Many of the children didnt know what a police officer was, he said. They didnt know what medication was for. He said none of the victims were permitted the use of toys or to engage in any form of recreational activity. They were allowed to write notes in journals, and the countys top prosecutor said there are hundreds of notebooks that investigators have yet to pore over. Hestrin acknowledged that while the abuse was extreme, theres no evidence the Turpins had an intent to kill. But the D.A. was tight-lipped as to a possible motive. He alluded to a pattern of behavior that pointed to the defendants gratification from manipulation. The parents would buy food for themselves and not allow the children to eat, Hestrin said. They would bring home apple pies and leave them on the kitchen cabinet for the children to see but not have. The alleged abuse also involved choking and beatings, according to the D.A. He said punishments worsened, particularly after the family moved to California, noting that the children were initially bound with ropes, but when they figured out how to escape from such bondage, the couple switched to chains and padlocks. When they were shackled, the often were not even released to go to the bathroom. The children were allowed to shower once a year, and according to Hestrin, if they washed their hands above the wrist, they were accused of playing in the water and they were chained up. This was depraved conduct, he added. It breaks our hearts. Hestrin said the victims are relieved to be out of the house on Muir Woods Road and are now in good hands. According to sheriffs investigators, the family moved to Murrieta in 2010, then to Perris in 2014. They had previously resided in Fort Worth, Texas, where Hestrin alleged the parents lived separate from the children for a time, stopping by only to drop off groceries. None of the victims have received medical care in at least four years, and none have ever seen a dentist, Hestrin said. The Turpins single-story home has been at the center of a media blitz following Mondays revelations about what deputies found when they went into the residence. Our deputies described a foul smell in the home. It was extremely dirty, and many of the children were malnourished, sheriffs Capt. Greg Fellows told reporters Tuesday. The Turpins 17-year-old daughter escaped the home by jumping through a window shortly before 6 a.m. Sunday, carrying a deactivated mobile phone with which she was able to dial 911, according to Fellows. The girl told dispatchers her 12 siblings were in need of help, and when deputies arrived, she presented them with photographs documenting conditions inside the residence, the captain said. According to Hestrin, the 17-year-old had been plotting the escape with some of her siblings for two years. He said one of her sisters escaped with her, but returned home out of fear. Fellows said three children were found chained to furniture in the residence when deputies went inside. According to Hestrin, the defendants managed to get two of those children -- aged 11 and 14 -- unchained as deputies searched the premises, but a 22-year-old was still shackled. Six of the children are under 18, while the others are adults. Their ages range from 2 to 29. Hestrin said the couple were not charged with torturing the 2-year-old, who appeared to have been properly fed. The lewd acts charge against David Turpin stems from his alleged molestation of one of the girls. Fellows said Louise Turpin was perplexed when deputies asked to enter the house. No illegal activity had been reported there before. State records show the residence was designated Sandcastle Day School, with David Turpin listed as the principal. Hes a former aerospace engineer with Northrop Grumman, and his wife a homemaker. Louise Turpins sister, Teresa Robinette of Knoxville, Tennessee, told a news outlet that she and her younger brother have been largely estranged from their sister for years. Robinette said she was speechless on learning of the couples arrest and the alleged circumstances. I cant even say the words to you that Id like to say to her, Robinette said. Our life wasnt perfect growing up, but we didnt live like that. Questions were raised Tuesday regarding religious zealotry, or even cult-like behavior by the parents, but Fellows said the investigation was still in the early stages. The child victims are undergoing medical treatment at Riverside University Medical Center in Moreno Valley, while the adults are receiving care at Corona Regional Medical Center. Representatives from the facilities said theyre being gradually restored to health. Theyre comfortable and in a very secure environment, Corona Regional Medical Center CEO Mark Uffer said. Theyve been through a very traumatic ordeal, but theyre very friendly, very cooperative and hopeful life will get better for them after this event. The Perris news quickly made national headlines and spread across social media as people shared the ghastly discovery. But no one was more surprised than the neighbors in the quiet development. Kimberly Milligan told KCAL the children looked so pale. Its so sad, so horrible, Jennifer Luna told KCAL. I cant believe this. I cant believe this. Ricardo Ross told The Press-Enterprise, Its very shocking. Very devastating. While Andria Valdez told the newspaper, They only came out at night. They were really, really pale. On social media, the Turpins painted a different picture than that described by sheriffs deputies. Photos that have surfaced on the Internet show a seemingly happy family with the children dressed in matching clothes. One photo shows the parents in wedding attire as their children are smiling beside them. The image is what David Turpins parents, James and Betty Turpin, believed to be true. James and Betty Turpin told ABC News they hadnt seen their son and daughter-in-law since visiting them in California some four to five years ago. However, they said they have kept in touch with them by phone since, ABC News reported. They told ABC News they had not spoken to their grandchildren, saying David Turpin or his wife would often call when they were without the children, who are homeschooled.

687,"A hate crime at a Murrieta high school is under investigation as police look to the public for help in identifying the suspects who were caught on camera spray-painting graffiti on campus, police say. The incident happened at Murrieta Valley High School on April 24. Investigators have labeled the racist, anti-Semitic symbols and words of vandalism a hate crime. It was partially captured on security surveillance cameras at the campus, which is located in the 42200 block of Nighthawk Way, and police this week released that footage. Murrieta Police Lt. Ron Driscoll said the vandals spent just over 10 minutes in the quad area, beginning about 1 a.m. on April 24. The space was tagged with what amounted to anti-Semitic, anti-LGBT and anti-African- American graffiti, Driscoll said. This was determined to be a hate crime and it was clear that those responsible for the graffiti were attempting to create dissent toward these specific groups, he said. Damage to the school was estimated to be about $300. One of the suspects was described as a thin male wearing a multi-colored body suit. The other suspect was described as stocky, wearing a hooded jacket, dark pants and white sneakers. The age, race and ethnicity of the pair are unknown.

688,"A Murrieta woman who, with the help of her mother, starved and physically mistreated her 3-year-old twin boys, was sentenced Tuesday to a two-year state prison term, as was her mother. Courtney Lynn Stewart, 26, and Tammy Lynn Gay, 47, each pleaded guilty in February to child abuse with a sentence-enhancing great bodily injury allegation. In exchange for their admissions, the Riverside County District Attorneys Office dropped a second child abuse charge with great bodily injury allegations against the pair. Superior Court Judge Kelly Hansen imposed the sentences stipulated under the plea agreement. Both Stewart and her mother will be sent to Chowchilla State Prison, where they will have to serve at least 20 months before theyre eligible for parole. Stewart was arrested in November 2014 following a nearly month-long investigation by Murrieta police. Gay was named a defendant in the case several weeks after her daughters arrest. Prosecutors said the twins, whose names were not released, suffered abuse going back to December 2012. According to Murrieta police, Stewart became the focus of an investigation on Nov. 7, 2014, after she took one of her sons to Rancho Springs Medical Center in Murrieta. Hospital staff were alarmed by the childs emaciated condition and several bruises uncovered during an examination, said Sgt. Phil Gomez. He said the boy weighed less than 15 pounds and was determined to be suffering from malnutrition. According to Gomez, Riverside County Child Protective Services workers took custody of the youngster, who was admitted for treatment and later transferred to Rady Childrens Hospital in San Diego for intensive pediatric care. Murrieta police detectives visited Stewarts residence and found the other twin suffering from the same malnutrition, as well as a broken jaw, according to Gomez. County social workers had the boy admitted for medical treatment, after which he was placed with his brother in the care of a third party. Hansens sentencing memorandum did not specify that the mother and grandmother are to be barred from seeing the twins, who are now 5 years old. By City News Service / Image via Police",0,8,5

690,"- A Napa woman employed as a Vallejo private school teacher was arrested Friday by the Napa Special Investigations Bureau following an investigation into reports that she was selling heroin. Lt. Gary Pitkin of the NSIB said Delicia Gomez, 36, was taken into custody Friday at her Napa apartment on an outstanding warrant related to alleged possession of pain pills for sale and identity theft. NSIB detectives had previously visited Gomezs apartment in the 1100 block of Marine Drive on Aug. 10 with a judge-approved search warrant. At that time, detectives allegedly recovered methadone, a powerful pain medication commonly diverted, abused and sold on the black market; along with an official California identification card belonging to someone else, Pitkin said. Gomez was not arrested at that time but detectives continued their investigation into her alleged drug sales activities -- recovering additional evidence allegedly outlining her involvement in selling drugs, the lieutenant said. Detectives also determined Gomez was an elementary school teacher at a private religious school in Vallejo, and a past tutor at a local Napa learning center, Pitkin said. NSIB presented its investigation to the Napa County District Attorneys Office, which in turn requested a warrant for her arrest on suspicion of possession of a controlled substance for sale, possession of drug paraphernalia and identity theft. On Friday, after learning the warrant had been issued, NSIB went to Gomezs apartment and arrested her without incident, Pitkin said. As Gomez was being booked into the Napa County jail, a correctional officer allegedly discovered three baggies containing suspected heroin that she was concealing on her person, Pitkin said. NSIB detectives returned to the jail to recover the suspected heroin and Gomez was booked on additional charges of possession of controlled substance for sale and bringing a controlled substance into a correctional facility. Her bail was set at $53,000, according to the lieutenant. Both learning institutions Gomez is affiliated with were advised of her arrest, Pitkin said. Image via Shutterstock",0,8,5

693,"On Tuesday, a 21-year-old Newport Beach man was ordered to stand trial on a murder charge stemming from the January killing of a former high school classmate, Blaze Bernstein. Prosecutors have deemed that the brutal killing of Blaze Bernstein a hate crime because he was gay. Samuel Lincoln Woodward is due back in court Sept. 17 for arraignment, according to court officials. He is accused in the killing of Blaze Bernstein, a University of Pennsylvania pre-med student whose body was found in a shallow grave in Borrego Park in Lake Forest early in 2018. Wooodward and Bernstein were classmates in High School at the Orange County School of the Arts in Santa Ana and reconnected over social media. We will prove that Woodward Killed Blaze because Blaze was gay, District Attorney Tony Rackauckas said at a press conference in August. The evidence was developed by examining Woodwards cell phone, laptop, social media and other digital evidence revealing the dark side of Woodwards thoughts and intentions. Woodwards attorney, Ed Munoz, previously said he and his clients family were deeply disappointed that the complaint was amended to allege the defendant carried out the killing due to Bernsteins sexual orientation. This is a complex case and the motivations each of the principals brought with them to that fateful meeting are multi-layered and theyre really complicated, so I guess from the narrow or selective view of the evidence this amended filing is not completely shocking, Munoz said on Aug. 2. Woodward has been diagnosed with autism, Munoz said.

694,"Orange County prosecutors said Thursday they have added a hate crime to the charges against Samuel Lincoln Woodward, 21, in the Jan. 2 murder of 19-year-old Blaze Bernstein. Woodward killed Blaze, because Blaze was gay, but there was more to the dark side of Woodwards thoughts than just Blazes sexuality, Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas said. Woodward was already facing 26 years to life in prison if convicted, but the addition of a hate crime could mean life in prison without the possibility of parole. After a detailed investigation of Woodwards laptop, cell phone and digital media, investigators from the Orange County Sheriffs Department found Woodward to be in possession of a large number of texts and images ... spewing hate of a homophobic, misogynistic, racist, anti-semitic and anti-government nature, Rackauckas said. Those findings support the hate crime charges, according to Rackauckas. In January, Woodward was charged with killing Bernstein, whose body was found buried in a shallow grave at a Lake Forest park in December 2017. Still, prosecutors did not immediately deem the killing a hate crime. 34th District Senator Janet Nguyen, 5th District Supervisor Lisa Bartlett and Blaze Bernsteins parents all spoke regarding the charge addition. I have full faith in the legal process and that justice will be served in this case, said 5th District Supervisor Lisa Bartlett. Intolerance based on gender, nationality, race or ethnicity, religion, or sexual orientation has no place in our society. Many of us only came to know Blaze because of the senseless way his life was taken, but I think it is important that we focus on the contributions that he made during his life and the legacy he leaves behind, said 34th District Senator Janet Nguyen. Woodward and Bernstein were classmates at the Orange County School of the Arts in Santa Ana and had reconnected through the social media platform Snapchat. Bernstein was home from college on winter break when he was slain. Rackauckas said in January that Woodward picked up Bernstein from his parents Lake Forest home about 11 p.m. Jan. 2, and drove him to a shopping center on Portola Parkway in Foothill Ranch. Later, the two went to Borrego Park in Lake Forest, he said. At some point, Woodward allegedly stabbed Bernstein multiple times, then buried the body in a dirt perimeter at the park. A search warrant affidavit obtained by the Orange County Register in January suggested that Bernstein may have tried to kiss Woodward, who responded by killing him in an act of rage. Rackauckas noted in January that state law does not allow prosecutors to attach a special-circumstance allegation to a murder charge in a case when a victim is targeted because they are female or gay. Blazes parents released a statement on behalf of their son: We live in a world where hate is real and the people that practice it can be hiding in your home in your childs computer. We continue to look towards the future and what we can do to make a difference. We continue to Blazitforward for Blaze and for YOU and continuing his legacy of improving the human condition; One intentional act of kindness at a time, their statement read. If we all started doing something about hate and about intolerance – we could change the world in a good way to prevent this type of heartache and injustice from happening again. We are grateful to the OCDA and OCSD for their continued hard work to bring us closure.

695,"Three Orange County men have filed a lawsuit against the owner of the Balboa Inn claiming a hate crime took place when they were booted from the establishment earlier this month, Patch has learned. On Friday the 13th at a bar on Main Street in Newport Beach, the three men went inside a restaurant for dinner. A video has emerged showing two of the men being forcibly removed from the restaurant. Two of the men have also filed a police report, reporting battery, according to Newport Beach Police Department information officer Jennifer Manzella, who discussed the incident with Patch. The victims say they were battered both inside and in front of the establishment, resulting in both needing medical attention, she said. The two men did receive medical attention after the event, but the Newport Beach police were not notified at the time of the incident, according to Manzella. They filed a police report the following Monday, she said. Angel Bonilla, Colton Moyer and Clement Serafin said in their lawsuit that a bartender refused to serve them and ordered them to leave shortly after they arrived at the bar for dinner and drinks. The female bartender demanded that they show their respective identification cards ... to create a ruse for refusing to serve them when her real motive was not to serve gay men, the lawsuit says. (See full video below). She claimed, loudly, that Serafins ID was fake and ordered him out of the bar, according to the lawsuit, which says Serafin is in his mid-30s. This was done with the specific intent to cause humiliation and mental suffering, the suit says. A man stepped in and reportedly used a gay slur, and then dragged Bonilla and Serafin from the establishment, according to the lawsuit. Video appears to back that up. In the below video, which is graphic in language and content, a man orders Bonilla to get out! and utters homophobic slurs as the man was thrown to the pavement. Bonilla can be heard crying and complaining about his head. It is unclear as of this report if the man in question was a patron or if he worked at the bar. Newport Beach police wish to question the unidentified man, as well as any other suspects who were in that establishment at the time of the scuffle.  In a gruff rebuttal to the mans cries, the man who forcibly removed them shouts: Youve been warned!  Bonillas cellphone was broken in the confrontation, according to the lawsuit. According to statements from the victims, they were not drinking prior to the exchange. We are seeking witnesses who may have witnessed the incident and what led up to it, Manzella said. We are looking for corroborating information on what happened at the establishment. According to Manzella, Newport Beach police did not yet have access to the video as of this report. Michel Pourmussa, who owns the Balboa Inn and is named as defendant in the case, was not available for comment. We have spoken with the staff on duty that evening, and are working with them to try and get statements, Manzella said. We are hoping that through publicity, others will come forward and share what they saw of the battery. We are hoping that people realize that it wasnt just an ordinary scuffle. The suspect is described as white male, approximately 40-55 years old, with gray hair. He is approximately 6 feet tall and weighs approximately 200 pounds. At the time of the incident, he was wearing shorts and a white T-shirt. NBPD Detectives are asking this person, or anyone who can help identify him, to come forward to assist in the investigation. Police are also seeking any additional witnesses who were in the area or the establishment at the time of the battery. Anyone who can offer assistance is encouraged to contact Detective Rick Henry at (949) 644-3790. Messages may also be left anonymously on the Police Departments recorded hotline at (800) 550-NBPD.

696,"A cold case was put to rest on Friday in the robbing, beating and strangling murder of a Newport Beach retiree 36 years ago. James Andrew Melton, 66, man was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for the slaying of 77-year-old Anthony DeSousa. Melton was convicted in a second retrial last May of first-degree murder and burglary in the October 1981 killing, with jurors finding true a special circumstance allegation that the killing was committed during a burglary and robbery. Sentencing was put off for nearly a year as Meltons attorney investigated an allegation of juror misconduct involving an alternate panelist who was reportedly overheard discussing details of the case in public outside of deliberations. Orange County Superior Court Judge Gregg Prickett denied a motion for new trial. He also declined a request to strike the special circumstances allegation so Melton could get an immediate shot at parole. Defense attorney Denise Gragg argued that Melton deserved a parole hearing based on the years he has already served in the case, his age and that he was so heavily drugged during the first of his three trials in 1982, which led a federal judge to overturn that verdict in January 2007. A retrial in May 2014 ended with jurors deadlocked 10-2 for guilt. Senior Deputy District Attorney Steve McGreevy cited Meltons prior criminal history of an attempted murder, two rapes and a robbery in his argument against striking the special circumstances. A major difference in the defendants third trial was testimony from a former cellmate, Johnny Boyd, who died of AIDS in 1992, the prosecutor said. Boyd had been granted immunity, and his account of Meltons apparent admittance to the killing was read back to jurors. The prosecutor told the jury that after DeSousas longtime wife died in 1974, he began living an openly gay lifestyle.McGreevy said one witness who is still alive -- Al Satter -- confirmed that he was friends with DeSousa for about seven years and that the two were sometimes intimate and often spent weekends together. Satter identified some of the victims stolen belongings and told authorities how DeSousa was a furious note taker who wrote down appointments on a calendar for dates he made with other men, McGreevy said. DeSousa placed a classified ad in a gay magazine, which is how he met Boyd, according to McGreevy. Boyd and Melton met as cellmates in a San Luis Obispo prison in 1980, where they became lovers and concocted a scheme to contact gay men, especially older men, go to their homes and look for valuables and take whatever they want and by any means necessary, the prosecutor said.Boyd got out of prison before Melton and met with DeSousa, McGreevy said. The plan for the two of them to rob DeSousa went awry when Boyd got picked up on an arrest warrant and landed in jail in Los Angeles County, the prosecutor said. Boyd had told DeSousa he wanted to introduce him to his cousin Melton, who went alone to meet with the victim in his home on Bolero Way on Oct. 10, 1981, McGreevy said. Melton, who had moved in with girlfriend Linda Diane Harris in Los Angeles after his release from prison in August 1981, told Harris, who has also since died, that he was going to a meeting at a Disneyland hotel and then head over to Costa Mesa before returning home, McGreevy said. DeSousa was beaten so severely that his attacker knocked out a tooth, McGreevy said. It wasnt until a few days later that a Newport Beach police officer tasked with conducting a welfare check of DeSousa managed to get a look into the victims home and saw that he was dead, McGreevy said. When Melton arrived back home, he was driving DeSousas car. And although he was broke before, he now had enough cash to treat Harris and other friends to dinner and a movie, McGreevy said. Melton met with Boyd and shared some of the details of his encounter with DeSousa, McGreevy said. When Boyd asked what happened, Melton takes his hands and makes a choking gesture, the prosecutor said. Boyd told his parole officer, who called Newport Beach police, McGreevy said. They found more of the victims belongings in the apartment he shared with Harris, he said.Gragg told the jury the key witness for the prosecution is Johnny Boyd ... who led a lifetime of con man activity, and argued that rudimentary DNA testing of evidence collected at the scene does not show Melton was in the victims home. Boyd was a jilted lover, who was infuriated that Melton moved in with a girlfriend when they both got out of prison, Gragg said, telling the jury the evidence is going to show you someone other than Mr. Melton committed the crime.

700,"NEWPORT BEACH, CA Orange County prosecutors today won a significant legal victory in the case against a 64-year-old man charged in a 1981 murder in Newport Beach when a judge ruled they could use testimony from an earlier hearing from one of the defendants friends, who has since died. Orange County Superior Court Judge Gregg Prickett ruled that he would let jurors hear incriminating testimony from a now-deceased friend of James Andrew Melton, 64, who is charged with beating and strangling 77-year-old Anthony DeSousa in his Newport Beach home. Jurors in a May 2014 trial of Melton did not hear evidence from the deceased Johnny Boyd, a partner in crime with Melton when they concocted a scheme to find victims in gay magazine classified ads, Senior Deputy District Attorney Steve McGreevy said. The jury in that trial deadlocked 10-2 in favor of convicting Melton of murder. Boyd, who was given immunity, testified that the two met in prison and had come up with the plan to seek out older, affluent men in gay mens magazines and prey on them, McGreevy said. Boyd was supposed to go along with Melton the night DeSousa was killed but he got picked up on an unrelated arrest warrant and was behind bars, McGreevy said. Afterward, Boyd testified, Melton told his friend what happened with DeSousa, McGreevy said. Melton was convicted in 1982 of the robbery-murder, but a federal judge in 2007 overturned that verdict, leading to a retrial. U.S. District Judge Robert M. Takasugi ruled that the defendant could not comprehend his original trial because of the psychiatric medications that were given to him. Melton had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder from violence and sexual abuse as a child and had a history of alcohol and drug abuse beginning when he was a child. Melton was awaiting execution at San Quentin when the federal judge intervened. After the new trial was ordered, prosecutors decided not to seek the death penalty against Melton. Before Takasugis ruling, Meltons conviction was upheld on appeal multiple times. Associate Public Defender Denise Gragg argued in the trial two years ago that authorities arrested the wrong person. She said Melton was at home when the victim was killed. DeSousa lived alone in his two-bedroom condo on Bolero Way when he was killed. Seven years after his wifes death, DeSousa had a lifestyle change and became openly homosexual, McGreevy said in the 2014 trial. DeSousa advertised in a national gay magazine for companionship, McGreevy said. The victim was found in his home with a pillow over his face and his hands bound. His attacker beat him so severely the victim lost a tooth, McGreevy said. Melton was wearing the victims watch when he was arrested, McGreevy said. City News Service",1,4,0
701,"A 24-year-old Irvine man pleaded not guilty today to charges stemming from an alleged racially motivated attack on a black teen and his older brother. Christopher Qu, who is of Asian descent, is accused of approaching the 16-year-old student about 12:50 p.m. last Wednesday at Irvine High School while the teen was waiting for a ride from his brother, said Farrah Emami of the Irvine Police Department. A pipe-wielding Qu spewed racial slurs at the boy, who was on campus for sports practice while the school was on spring break, and was advancing on the teen when his 24-year-old sibling drove up, Emami alleged. Qu banged the pipe against several railings as he advanced on the teen, Deputy District Attorney Jess Rodriguez alleged. The brother got out of the car in time to intervene, but Qu allegedly head-butted the man and slammed the pipe against his arm several times. The man, whose name was not released, sustained a broken nose and bruises on his arms, Rodriguez said. His brother was unhurt, she said. Qu was arrested nearby and police recovered a blood-spattered pipe in the schools parking lot, Emami said. Qu is charged with aggravated assault and assault with force likely to produce great bodily injury, both felonies, as well as a misdemeanor count of violating civil rights. He also faces sentence-enhancing allegations of committing a hate crime, causing great bodily injury and having a prior strike conviction for criminal threats in 2013, Rodriguez said. Qu, who was on probation at the time of the alleged attack on the brothers, could face up to 19 years in prison if convicted.

704,"The number of hate crimes reported to police in Los Angeles rose 10.8 percent in 2017, the fourth consecutive increase and part of a state and national trend that has seen a spike in such reports over the past several years, according to a study released Friday. The study, conducted by the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at Cal State San Bernardino, consisted of a national sample of over three dozen large American cities, including 10 in California. Long Beach saw its hate-crime reports double in 2017, and San Diego saw a 17-percent increase. Riverside and San Bernardino were the only California cities in the study that saw a decrease in hate crimes reported last year. Overall, the study showed a 12-percent increase in hate-crime reports nationwide in 2017, which follows a 5-percent increase in 2016. California, however, has seen its hate-crime reports increase at a higher rate than the national figures, including a 19-percent rise in 2017. The CSUSB study records a 64 percent increase from 2014 to 2017 for the 10 California cities studied. In Los Angeles, 254 hate crimes were reported in 2017. African- Americana and Jews were the most frequently targeted, but the city also had a significant rise in anti-transgender attacks. It was the largest number of reported hate crimes the city has seen since 2008, when the city recorded 280 hate crimes. The most common type of offenses were property damage/vandalism (82); simple assault (53); aggravated assault (46) and criminal threat (44). Among the cities studied, Los Angeles was second only to New York (339) in total hate-crime reports in 2017.

705,"Hate crimes in the city of Los Angeles hit multi- year highs in 2016 , according to an analysis released Tuesday by Cal State San Bernardino researchers, who pegged the overall increase at 15 percent. The report by the universitys Center on Hate & Extremism found that last years increase to 230 hate crimes, from 200 in 2015, was driven in large part by a 64 percent surge in violent aggravated assaults, an 18.5 percent rise in racially motivated crimes and a 24.5 percent increase in crimes against the LGBGT community. Catalytic or national events can impact the number of hate crimes, but so do local events, economics and individual conflicts at the neighborhood level, said Brian Levin, director of the CSULB center. Its a combination of things. At the same time, religious hate crimes against Jews and Muslims declined significantly in the city during the period, the researchers found. There have been no bias homicides reported by the Los Angeles Police Department in the last two years. By comparison, aggravated assaults overall in the city during 2016 rose about 10 percent, and the number of robberies increased 13 percent. The city of Los Angeles prides itself on being a multicultural haven, said Dr. Kevin Grisham, the centers assistant director for research. Its troubling to see significant increases in these crimes. Of the localities surveyed, Los Angeles had the third-largest number of hate crimes in the nation, with only New York and Boston reporting more, the researchers said. The three dozen reported aggravated assaults include physical attacks with a weapon or attacks capable of producing serious bodily injury. Hate crimes are criminal acts motivated in significant part by the actual or perceived group characteristic of another such as race, religion and sexual orientation. For Los Angeles, the 2016 hate crime totals were the highest since 2008, when the city recorded 280 hate crimes. While 2016 marked the third annual consecutive increase, last years totals are still far below various highs tallied in recent decades. In 2001, the year of the 9/11 terror attacks, Los Angeles had 559 hate crimes, the highest number so far this century. In 1992, official data did not accurately include the 60-plus people killed and others injured in rioting following the state trial acquittal of the officers involved in the videotaped Rodney King police beating, according to the report. Levin said the majority of hate crimes remain unreported, some due to the controversy over immigration. Were worried that with the increase in attention paid to immigration issues, many victims will be hesitant to report hate crimes for fear of deportation, he said. While Los Angeles had three straight years of rising hate crime, the nation has not seen consecutive increases since 2004. City News Service",0,8,5
706,"- Jurors deadlocked Thursday in the penalty phase of trial of a man who killed a young woman during a rape in Glendale 37 years ago. The jury that convicted Darrel Mark Gurule of murder was unable to reach a unanimous verdict in the penalty phase, with 10 voting in favor of recommending life in prison without parole and two recommending death. A hearing was set for Dec. 2 to determine the next step in the case. Gurule was convicted Sept. 28 of first-degree murder for the shooting death of 23-year-old Barbara Ballman. During the penalty phase of trial, Deputy District Attorney Jonathan Chung showed the eight-man, four-woman panel a photo of Ballman, whose naked body was found in the early morning hours of Sept. 21, 1979, inside her Volkswagen sedan parked across from Edison Elementary School. That image was followed quickly by a photograph of a bloodied Roberto Bruno, whom Gurule was previously convicted of murdering. Bruno was shot in the head in 1987. Chung said witnesses and transcripts show that Gurule, 57, also kidnapped and sexually assaulted another woman in 1977, assaulted two brothers in 1979, robbed a man in 1982 and received stolen goods in 1986. Defense attorney Philip Peng asked jurors to choose life. At minimum, Darrel Gurule will die in prison. Hes never going to get out, Peng said. During his 10,592 days in custody, Gurule has never threatened anyone, never harmed anyone, the defense attorney told jurors. The question is does Darrel die on Gods time or is he going to die on mans time? he said. Gurule grew up in Echo Park in the 1960s and 70s, when the area was controlled by warring gangs, Peng said. Darrels father was an extremely vicious man with heavy hands, who regularly beat his wife Lydia and their eight children, the defense attorney said. He pointed to Gurules troubled childhood as a mitigating factor weighing favor of a life-without-parole sentence. On July 4, 1973, Gurule was found with six of his siblings, ages 4-17, in what police had thought was an abandoned house in Glendale, devoid of furniture other than a few mattresses. Officers found rotting food all over the floor and a kitchen floor covered with newspaper and feces, Peng said. Gurules father was out of the picture by then and his mother was out on a date. Ballman was killed on Sept. 20, 1979, sometime after leaving her older sisters home at 7:30 p.m. Linda Benjamin told jurors that her sibling moved to California after she did. When she first came out, I felt responsible for her well-being, Benjamin said. Ballman took classes at Glendale College and worked at a group home and residential treatment center for young women called Penny Lane. I hate that she ... was murdered on my watch, Benjamin said, reading from a journal she kept after her sister was killed. If I could have had only five more minutes with you it would have made my life more bearable, she read. I would gladly trade places with you to do the hard part. Its just a thing I will never be able to understand, she wrote in referencing the tragedy and horror of your death. Benjamin referred more than once to Gurule as a monster and said she was not only sad, but angry that coward, that monster is still walking around. Jurors found true special circumstance allegations of murder during the commission of a rape and murder with a prior conviction but deadlocked on a third special circumstance allegation -- murder during the course of a robbery. Gurule wasnt charged with Ballmans murder until 2010. Glendale police said semen evidence was recovered from the victim, who had been shot in the abdomen, but DNA analysis was not available at the time. In 2004, Gurules DNA was submitted to a law enforcement database. When Glendale police re-opened an investigation into Ballmans killing and submitted the semen evidence to the Los Angeles County Sheriffs Departments crime lab, a match was made with Gurules DNA. Gurule was 19 at the time of the killing and has been serving a life prison sentence since 1987 for the kidnap-murder of Bruno, which detectives believe was the result of a drug deal gone wrong. -- City News Service, photo via Shutterstock",0,8,5
707,"By ELIZABETH HSING-HUEI CHOU Los Angeles, CA -- Mayor Eric Garcetti said today he continues to support Los Angeles Police Department Chief Charlie Beck, despite calls for the chiefs ouster by activists upset over a decision upholding the actions of an officer who fatally shot a black woman in the Crenshaw district. A group of Black Lives Matter protesters has been staging a sit-in at the main entrance of City Hall since Tuesday, when the Police Commission ruled that the Aug. 12, 2015, shooting of 30-year-old Redel Jones by an LAPD officer was within department policy. Jones allegedly lunged at officers with a knife as police hunted for a suspect who robbed a pharmacy in the 3700 block of Santa Rosalia Drive. Protesters have pointed to a differing account by a witness who said police shot Jones while she was running away. More than 30 demonstrators were at City Hall today holding signs and marching across the street. Demonstrators said police officers came warned them this morning that they need to take down protest signs that were affixed to the City Hall building. An officer also came out at midday to give the demonstrators information about a city codes barring them from camping permanently on sidewalks less than 10 feet from an entranceway, which could make it potentially impossible for the protesters to remain where they are. The demonstrators have the option to move to a free speech area across the street, according to police. Melina Abdullah, one of the leaders of Black Lives Matter Los Angeles, said the protesters will remain where they are until Beck is fired. Were asking everyone to come join us, Abdullah said. If you cant join us physically, then you can call the mayor and demand that he fire Chief Beck. Abdullah said the group does not plan to move the protest across the street. Thats not something that were willing to do, she said. Were going to stay here as long as we can until Chief Beck is fired. If they violently remove us, then well be removed, but we are committed to staying here.She told reporters that the police chief has done too little to protect black Angelenos. They (the LAPD) are killing black people with regularity and repressing those of us who dare to say we wont allow our communities to be under siege anymore, Abdullah said. Theyre engaging us with violent repression. She said the LAPD needs to engage in more community solutions and that instead of spending money on violent policing, the city should be putting more funds behind those services and resources that actually make community safe, such as intervention work, affordable housing, a livable wage and mental health services. Garcetti has held fast to his support for Beck, saying on the McIntyre in the Morning program on KABC-AM radio today that I believe in Charlie Becks leadership. I think it was something reflected when the White House called a few police chiefs from around the country, he said. He (Beck) was one of the ones they reached out to. ... Hes not perfect. Im not perfect. The citys not perfect. But hes somebody I strongly support as someone who has continued to push forward with constitutional policing as a foundation for how we win trust. Garcetti and Beck took part in a meeting in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday with President Barack Obama, mayors, police chiefs, activists and administration officials to discuss frayed relations between the public and law enforcement in the aftermath of recent fatal officer-involved shootings, and the sniper killings of five police officers in Dallas. Activists have been demanding a meeting with the mayor. Garcetti said he has offered to meet inside City Hall with a small delegation from the group, while suggesting that he does not want to be met with shouting. Garcetti issued a statement saying he believes the concerns of Black Lives Matter protesters are serious and valid, and that throughout this week Ive offered to meet with a delegation from Black Lives Matter -- in addition to the other meetings I have convened, and conversations I have had, with civil rights, community, law enforcement and religious leaders. Abdullah said the group has refused the offers because the demonstrators are not interested in having closed-door meetings with a few people. We believe in democracy even if the mayor doesnt, and that means coming down to the people, not being afraid of the people hes supposed to represent, she said. Were open to meeting with him here, publicly.She said the mayors office earlier this week offered to hold a meeting with a group of 10 activists, but yesterday reduced that number down to a five- member delegation. The sit-in began Tuesday after activists who packed the Police Commission meeting demanded that the officer who shot Jones be disciplined, saying a witness claimed Jones was running away from police when she was shot. Becks report to the commission, however, cited witnesses who said Jones was moving toward police with a knife. After the commission upheld the officers actions, protesters marched to City Hall and began the sit-in on the Main Street steps of City Hall. City News Service; Photo: Wikimedia Commons",1,0,0
708,"- An Los Angeles man was charged with capital murder Monday in the case of a transgender woman who he allegedly met online. Kevyn Ramirez, 29, is accused of killing Victoria Ramos Gutierrez on Jan. 10. Ramirez allegedly stabbed the victim and set her on fire residence located in the 1700 block of South New Hampshire Avenue in Los Angeles, prosecutors said. Ramirez is charged with special circumstance murder, a special circumstance allegation of murder during the commission of an attempted first-degree robbery, and an allegation of personal use of a deadly and dangerous weapon, a knife. The defendant is additionally charged with two counts of arson with allegations of multiple structures and use of an accelerant. If convicted, Ramirez faces the death penalty or life in prison without the possibility of parole. A decision on whether to seek the death penalty will be made at a later date. Ramirez is being held without bail. --Photo via Shutterstock",1,2,0
709,"An angry husband thought that he had committed the perfect crime by killing his wife and blaming it on his gay son, whom he claimed to have shot to death in self-defense, a prosecutor told a San Fernando jury Tuesday, but a defense attorney countered that his client told the truth about the two deaths. Shehada Issa is charged with two counts of murder stemming from the stabbing death of his wife, Rabihah, some time between March 27 and March 29, and the shotgun shooting death of his 38-year-old son, Amir -- known as Rocky -- on March 29. The charges include the special circumstance allegation of multiple murders, along with gun and knife-use allegations. Issa, now 70, was charged April 1 with his sons shooting death, along with a hate crime allegation that the murder was committed because of the victims sexual orientation. He was subsequently charged April 28 with his wifes killing. Issa could face life without the possibility of parole if convicted as charged. The Los Angeles County District Attorneys Office opted earlier not to seek the death penalty against him. Deputy District Attorney Leila Tahmassebi told jurors in her opening statement that Issa had a longtime gambling problem that caused him to have a constant need for cash. She alleged that Issas motive for murdering his wife was her refusal to allow him to put their North Hills home on the market. As for Rocky, Issa had a unique hatred and disgust for his son because of his sexual preference and because he refused to move out of adjoining rooms at the home, Tahmassebi alleged. In January, Rabihah told her husband that she would not sign home sale papers, and Issa responded by threatening her life and listing the house anyway, the prosecutor alleged. Issa also failed to evict his son from the home, she said. Evidence will show he made good on (his) threats and brutally murdered his wife and son, Tahmassebi alleged. He thought that he had committed the perfect crime ..., she said. There is only one truth and that is that the defendant intentionally murdered his wife and his son. Defense attorney Anthony Willoughby painted a different picture for the jury. There are just two issues in this case -- who killed Ms. Issa and why did my client shoot his son, the attorney said in his opening statement. According to Willoughby, Issa came home from a trip, found his wife stabbed to death, grabbed a rifle, went outside and found Rocky. Believing his son to be armed with a knife, Issa shot and killed him, the lawyer said. This case has nothing to do with Rocky being gay, Willoughby insisted. The dead man had mental issues -- and its those issues that bring us here today, the defense attorney said. Willoughby suggested that Rocky killed his mother and threatened his father with a knife, leading Issa to shoot his son in self-defense. The first prosecution witness was the defendants second-eldest son, who told the jury that his father had a violent, abusive relationship with Rabihah and an ever-increasing hatred for Rocky. Victor Issa told of constant money problem and squabbles within the home as a result of his fathers gambling. He also said that when the defendant found out that Rocky was gay, their relationship changed. He detested (the fact that his son was gay), the witness testified. He detested him. He was ashamed of him. He called him things like whore of Babylon. It was constant for years. It was, he deserves to die. Testimony is set to continue Wednesday. Tahmassebi said Issas other children would take the stand during the trial. --City News Service/Images via Amir Issa, Facebook",1,4,0
710,"- Law enforcement authorities and Muslim community leaders Monday condemned a series of letters sent to area mosques denouncing Muslims and warning of a pending cleansing of America under President Donald Trump, and local officials urged anyone who receives such a letter to come forward. I would encourage you, the community, that if you receive letters like this, please report them, said Stephen Woolery, FBI special agent in charge of the bureaus Counterterrorism Division in Los Angeles. Because we know that there is under-reporting in a number of crimes that occur. We encourage you to report these things so we can get to the bottom of it and we can keep the community safe. Joined by officials from the Los Angeles Police Department, Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department. Los Angeles School Police and Muslim community organizations, Woolery said the letters contained awful, awful language against Muslims, but did not contain any specific threat. Officials with the Council on American-Islamic Relations chapters in Anaheim and the San Francisco Bay Area reported that the mosques received a hand-written letter calling Muslims vile and filthy people, and telling them to pack your bags and get out of Dodge. The letters said President-elect Donald Trump would cleanse America and make it shine again. And, hes going to start with you Muslims. The letters were addressed to Children of Satan, and warned that Trump was going to do to you Muslims what Hitler did to the Jews. Woolery said the letters were delivered to the Islamic Center of Southern California in Los Angeles, along with mosques in Signal Hill, Northridge, Claremont and San Jose. He also said a similar letter was sent to a mosque in Georgia. The letters that were seeing, they all look similar in language, he said. I dont want to be too absolute but they look like they come from the same author. Los Angeles Police Department Deputy Chief Michael Downing said the letters sent to the Islamic Center of Southern California and the mosque in Northridge were postmarked Nov. 19. Were asking all communities -- if youve received letters like this to make sure you report those, Downing said at the news conference at the Islamic Center of Southern California. Hateful rhetoric creates fear among so many communities, and I think its also caused by people who are fearful of communities that are different from themselves, Downing said. ... The real message here is we are all Americans. This is our home, whether youre Christian, Muslim or Jew. Salam Al-Marayati, president of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, said he and other community leaders want to reassure people who are targets of hateful language or bullying that they are not alone. We will meet this kind of hate with force, he said. Let me just speak directly to the person who wrote these letters to the mosques: You are a coward -- unless you come here and debate the points that you apparently believe so much in. So let us bring this darkness that you are in to light, and let us discuss these issues directly ... Al-Marayati pointed to anti-Muslim sentiment among a fringe element of America that includes conspiracy theories about Muslims and Islam. The more you repeat a lie, the more it becomes fact, he said. So let us debate these issues out in the open. -- City News Service, photo courtesy of CAIR",1,3,3
711,"- Addressing critics who say racial profiling is still a significant problem for the police department, Chief Charlie Beck said Tuesday that while he believes bias is not rampant among officers, he hopes to build more trust between police and the community. Beck made the comments after a special Police Commission meeting that was intended to re-open a dialogue into the issue of racial profiling, or biased policing. The gathering marked one of the first times in months in which a meeting by the oversight panel was not disrupted by people protesting Beck and the departments policing practices. Do I think that biased policing is rampant? Absolutely not, Beck told reporters. Do I think it occurs? Of course it does. Beck said he felt the best way to address bias was through exercises that build trust, on the police side and on the communitys side. The Police Commission helped facilitate one of those exercises, holding the special meeting at City Hall on racial profiling, which the department has traditionally measured by investigating and mediating complaints submitted by residents. While the department receives many biased-policing complaints, very few are sustained, leading many activists to wonder whether the department is using an effective means of measuring and rooting out profiling. They argue that counter to the small number of sustained complaints, racial profiling is a major problem because black and Latino residents are still being subjected to police stops or targeted by police at far higher frequencies than white residents. Police department officials Tuesday acknowledged that determining whether there is racial profiling can be difficult, but said they have been diligent in their efforts to try to prevent it. Officers are screened for bias during recruitment and receive training to make them more aware of bias, including the type that is unconsciously held. The department also makes an effort to foster deeper relationships with the community through community policing programs, they said. The meeting offered activists and critics more time than usual to put forward their own suggestions for how the department could improve its policing practices, and many lauded a presentation by L. Song Richardson, a UC Irvine law professor who gave a primer on unconscious or implicit bias. Richardson said most people are affected by implicit bias, and it is often a way to make decisions or come to conclusions efficiently during ambiguous situations. Such biases can often be instilled through the social environment and culture, she said. Social scientists who measure the effects of implicit bias have found that people of all races and ages learn biases that cast black men in a negative light much more often than their white counterparts, Richardson told the commission. Such biases also occur in people who believe strongly that all people should be treated equally, she said. In the context of policing, implicit biases have the potential of escalating tense encounters or can lead officers to interpret non-threatening actions in a black or Latino person as aggression, she said. Richardson recommended structural changes that promote less-biased behavior in officers, saying that just making officers aware of implicit bias is not enough. Richardson said that rather than creating incentives that reward officers ability to issue citations and make arrests -- leading to an effect that punishes more minority residents than whites -- the department should consider rewarding officers for developing a better bond with the community. Also addressing the commission was Peter Bibring, a lawyer with American Civil Liberties Union, who argued that black and Latino people are stopped by the Los Angeles Police Department at much higher rates than whites. Bibring said it shows there is a problem with racial profiling, and that its not just a perception problem. Union officials representing rank-and-file police officers said Tuesday that in order to do the kind of community-oriented police work promoted by the department at such hearings, they need more staffing. They say that while they are validated by the departments report on efforts to prevent racial profiling and the survey results showing the majority of residents have positive feelings about them, our officers lack the time and resources to conduct proactive community policing that is the bedrock to building productive relationships that help keep neighborhoods safe. The residents and police officers of Los Angeles deserve a new approach to community policing, their statement said, but that will require policymakers to roll up their sleeves and match their rhetoric with action.

712,"A 69-year-old man charged with fatally shooting his gay son in North Hills is also being investigated in connection with the stabbing death of his wife, a detective said today. Los Angeles Police Department Detective John Doerbecker told the Los Angeles Times the son may have been killed not over his sexual orientation, as prosecutors initially said, but as part of an effort by the suspect to cover up the earlier killing of his wife. Shehada Khalil Issa was arrested after the March 29 shooting of his son, 38-year-old Amir Issa. The father was charged Friday with murder. Police were called to the familys house in the 15000 block of Rayen Street shortly after 9 a.m. and found Amir Issa dead outside the residence and his mother dead inside the home, according to police and prosecutors. The mother, identified by the coroners office as Rabihah Issa, 68, was stabbed multiple times, police said. In announcing the murder charge against Shehada Issa, the District Attorneys Office indicated that Issa had killed his son because of his sexual orientation, and alleged that Issa had previously threatened to kill his son because he was gay. But Doerbecker told The Times that Issas anger over his sons sexuality was believed to be a contributing factor in the shooting, but not the underlying motivation for the killing. Doerbecker said detectives are working on the theory that dad killed mom and then killed his son to cover it up. According to Doerbecker, Issa told authorities he heard noises in his home and, suspecting a burglar, grabbed a shotgun only to be confronted by his son, who Issa said was carrying a knife. Doerbecker told The Times police found no knife near the sons body and officers discovered the bloody body of Issas wife while investigating the sons death. Doerbecker said police were still reviewing evidence before seeking a possible murder charge against Issa for his wifes killing. The woman is believed to have died 12 to 24 hours before the son was shot, he told the paper. Shehada Issa is scheduled to be arraigned Monday in San Fernando.

713,"You have to be really careful with the press -- not all of them, because I know some great reporters. But Im going to start naming names because it really is incredible how dishonest the press is. -Donald Trump In a poll released last year, 16% of Americans said that there was no solid evidence that the average temperature on earth has been getting warmer over the past four decades. It is very important to note that they were not passing judgement on the cause of this warming, they were denying the fact that Earth has warmed since 1880...with the 20 warmest years having occurred since 1981 and with all 10 of the warmest years occurring in the past 12 years. A large amount of blame for this ignorance falls on our media which covers this subject by pretending that it is debatable, sitting two people side-by-side, creating the appearance that they have equal weight. If, instead of this false equivalence, they held a statistically representative climate change debate that had 97 scientists debating three climate change deniers, the American public might have a greater understanding of how science works. It has yet to be proven how much the hot air coming from Donald Trumps presidential campaign will increase the rate of global warming. His increasingly outrageous statements have continuously kept him in the spotlight allowing him to brag that he has spent nothing on his campaign and that he cant advertise because [hes] getting so much coverage. He keeps the reporters who cover him in line with a mixture of public ridicule at his rallies and threats to cut off access. The press reacts by allowing him to confuse biased reporting with doing the job of asking hard questions of the person who seeks be the leader of the free world. Nowhere was this more obvious than on Trumps appearance on Meet the Press: DONALD TRUMP: Going all the way. If I dont win, I dont win. But, you know, maybe that can happen. But Im leading every poll, big-- CHUCK TODD: Will you accept the idea that you might lose Iowa? You could lose it. On Sunday, Todds own network released its own poll showing that Ted Cruz is up by 4% in Iowa. This is likely within the margin of error and, therefore, represents a tie. It is certainly not a big lead by Trump. Todd ignores Trumps misstatement of the facts and sets the tone for the interview. In answer to Todds question how do you know someone is a Muslim?, there was this exchange: DONALD TRUMP: Hey, look, this has become a very big factor over the last week-and-a-half, two weeks, since I made my announcement that we have to see what the hell is going on. In the meantime, the other night, you have a cop shot in Philadelphia with a gun put to his head. And you know the chants and the rantings and the ravings. Now, youre looking at Cologne, Germany. You take a look at Cologne, Germany -- having riots -- CHUCK TODD: How do you do it, though? I get it. Or do you just say, You know what? You do it geographically. You dont even do it a religious test-- Trump was correct in asserting that there were riots in Germany. However, Todd failed to point out that the people rioting were not Muslims but far-right [and] anti-Islam, some of whom bore tattoos with far-right symbols such as a skull in a German soldiers helmet. If Trump was implying that we are facing similar rioting and that we should, therefore, banish these types from our shores, he should consider the fact that this group calls itself the Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West. DONALD TRUMP: Certain people come in. If theyre business people, if theyre proven. But we have to find out what the problem is. Now, we can be politically correct and never discuss it. But we cant let that happen to our country. CHUCK TODD: Let me get some news of the week. China. Clearly, its economy-- theyre having a problem. Theyre having a crisis there. You have railed that China is beating America. And yet-- The proper followup to this statement should have been that Trumps first television advertisement calls for a temporary shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. The word certain is not included before the word Muslims in this statement. It is also left unclear why Trump considers business people less dangerous that orphans or members of our military. If he asked people who lost their homes during the housing crisis or homeowners who have been chased from their homes by the Porter Ranch gas leak, they might tell him that business people have had a more negative effect on their lives than ISIS. On a side note, businessmen would have been a less politically correct term. CHUCK TODD: Okay. Were on our best two-year, job creation streak in 20 years. China is cratering our stock market for the problems they have at home. How is that the definition of China winning and America losing-- DONALD TRUMP: Okay, first of all, take a look at our G.D.P. And if you look at that, if you look at our productivity, if you look at the fact that people, in ten years, essentially, havent had a raise, or people going down instead of up. The jobs, a lot of temporary jobs; people are working temporary jobs and jobs that they dont want instead of jobs-- our economys doing horribly. And you take a look at that jobs report. The jobs report is fiction because all of the people that gave up-- CHUCK TODD: Its total fiction? You dont think-- DONALD TRUMP: I would say, honestly-- CHUCK TODD: --theres been improvement from the crash-- Todd could have questioned multiple parts of this statement. While the economy has performed worse than average for GDP growth [and] job creation during Obamas presidency, the United States GDP growth has beat the GDP growth of the other original NATO member countries by the widest margin of any president since World War II. As of October 2015, 8,394,000 jobs have been created during Obamas presidency. The last year we had GDP contraction was 2008. Productivity has also grown, again at a slower than usual pace. Trump is correct in stating that wages have slid under Obama, but this tells only half the story as corporate profits are at record levels. As of 2014, medium household income was down 3 percent, while corporate profits [were] at their highest level in at least 85 years. It would have been interesting to hear Trump answer whether a billionaire or a Democratic Socialist would be in a better position to fix this problem. Finally, Todd did not follow up when Trump avoided his question about the allegation that the jobs report is fiction. It was a case of journalistic malpractice that he allowed the candidate to accuse the President of fraud without demanding an explanation of the charge. DONALD TRUMP: But listen, Chuck, you have 60, 70, 80 million people out there that want to work that arent getting jobs. CHUCK TODD: You have said you think President Obamas a terrible negotiator. Despite Trumps previous allegation that the jobs report is fiction, the statistics that Trump uses in this statement are also derived from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. As a person running as a businessman, Trump should understand what these numbers mean, but the fact that he says that these people want to work shows that he is either ignorant or lying. Yet Todd neglects to ask him why he believes that jobs should be found for people who are not looking for work, including retirees, students or [those] who left the job market for family reasons, illness or some other factor. DONALD TRUMP: But you look at the Iran deal. You look at these deals. I always bring up Bergdahl. We get a traitor, they get five people that theyve wanted for nine years, and theyre back on the battlefield, trying to kill everybody, including us. And we get a dirty, rotten traitor. So let me just tell you, thats the kind of deals we make. The Iran deal? We give them $150 billion. We get nothing-- CHUCK TODD: By the way, though-- DONALD TRUMP: We dont even get our prisoners back-- CHUCK TODD: They just shipped the uranium out, though. I mean, theyre living up to the deal. For this exchange, Todd gets partial credit as he stated after playing the tape of the interview for the viewers that PolitiFact found Trumps assertion that the men released in exchange for Bergdahl were back on the battlefield was false. Unfortunately, he did not point this out to Trump. He also neglected to point out that we did not give the Iranians $150 billion. Instead, their own funds were released back to them.  DONALD TRUMP: Obamacare, as you know, is going to fail very soon, and probably in 17, our health care. We dont have borders. We dont have anything. I think, if Im there in two years and Im making a speech, I say were getting better, fast. CHUCK TODD: And in that first speech to Congress, youre going to lay out your first 100 days agenda, what are those four issues that are going to be on there-- Once again, Todd allows Trump to state an opinion as if it is a fact. At the very least, Todd should have responded that he does not know that Obamacare is going to fail very soon. Even better, he should have asked for facts to back up this assertion. When Americans go to the polls in November, we are not selecting the winner of a reality show. We are electing the leader of the free world. It is time for the press to start doing their job so that we make that a choice armed with facts. Trump cannot cut off everyone for asking tough questions - his campaign will not last if cut off from the free publicity. ____________________________________________ I am a former candidate for the District 3 seat on the LAUSD School Board, founder of Change The LAUSD and member of the Northridge East Neighborhood Council.

714,"SEBASTOPOL, CA- Three war veterans came to the aid of a woman who was assaulted at a Sebastopol cemetery on Memorial Day morning, police said. Police Officer Joseph Furry responded around 9:30 a.m. Monday to an assault by a woman on another woman at Sebastopol Memorial Lawn at 7951 Bodega Ave. The victim was on the ground and being attended to by three members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 3919 when he arrived, Furry said. Witnesses and the 60-year-old victim said the suspect, later identified as Holly Mae Lewis, 36, of Santa Rosa, was angry because she could not find a relatives gravesite. Lewis made racial comments regarding the victims speech and started slapping, kicking and punching her, Furry said. The veterans, ages 68 through 83, were preparing for a Memorial Day ceremony nearby and came to the victims aid. One of the veterans tackled Lewis and another, a retired Sebastopol police lieutenant, struggled to stop Lewis from pulling the victims hair, Furry said. Lewis fled in a blue minivan but witnesses were able to provide a partial license plate. Sebastopol police dispatcher Tracy Peters used different combinations of the numbers and letters in the license plate and the last name on the gravesite of Lewis relative to discover the vans license plate, Furry said. Police identified Lewis as the suspect and contacted her at her Santa Rosa home. She was arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon other than a firearm and committing a hate crime. Lewis posted $30,000 bail and was released from the Sonoma County Jail. The victim was treated at the scene and didnt require transport to a hospital, Furry said. – By Bay City News Service.

715,"- A California pastor said the local homeowner association removed his churchs nativity scene. Pastor Mike Openshaw told NBC 7 the display representing the birth of Jesus was removed from exterior of the Lighthouse Christian Church. Openshaw told the news station he received an email from the Ranch Maintenance Agreement Board last Thursday asking him to remove the religious display. A day later, the group removed it themselves, Openshaw told NBC 7. I found the Nativity scene behind the monument in a jumble all disconnected and no one was here, Openshaw told the news station. Apparently, the group claims the nativity scene was removed because the property belongs to the group and not the church, the news station reported. A nativity scene is a common sight during Christmas season, where figures representing Mary, Joseph and an infant Jesus are on display. --Photo via Pixabay/User strecosa",1,3,2
716,"A manicurist is being held on $300,000 bail, and could face up to 12 years in prison if convicted for destroying statues in Orange County Buddhist temples, the Orange County District Attorneys office has said. The woman allegedly used a rock to remove the hands and fingers on multiple statues. She was charged with eight felony counts of vandalism, the Orange County District Attorneys Office said. Officials are calling this a hate crime, as it shows past intent of desecrating places of worship, Senior Deputy District Attorney Paul Chrisopoulos said. Trang Thu Pham, 48, was thought to have caused $100,000 in property damages at the Huong Tich temple and the Phuc Quana on several occasions in August, according to the Garden Grove and Santa Ana Police Departments. This, after being released early from county jail for allegedly trashing other statues and temples in Garden Grove and Santa Ana in early August. Pham was deemed a person of interest last week, according to Sgt. Anthony Bertagna of the Santa Ana Police Department. If Pham is responsible, it would not be the first time she was caught vandalizing the statues, according to court records. In May of 2015, Pham was convicted for similar vandalism charges over the winter of 2015. Records show that she was sentenced to two years in jail. An attack on one religion is an attack on all, stated District Attorney Tony Rackauckas. We must stand up to bigotry and respect everyones right to worship. OCDA Photo",1,3,2
717,"A student accused of vandalizing Orange Coast College and vehicles with racial slurs and swastikas faces only one year in jail after his plea bargain one week ago, according to his attorney. The former Orange Coast College student, Robert Bouton McDougal, pleaded guilty to a single felony count of vandalism and eight misdemeanors on Thursday, according to court records. That felony will be reduced to a misdemeanor at sentencing, his attorney, John Christl, said. McDougal admitted two counts of disobeying a court order, two counts of resisting arrest, and single counts each of remaining on campus without consent, vandalism and unlawfully providing false information to a police officer, all misdemeanors. Orange County Superior Court Judge Kazuharu Makino put a one-year lid on his sentence, meaning the punishment could not exceed a year behind bars, Christl said. McDougal is scheduled to be sentenced Aug. 30. Christl previously said his client struggles with a variety of mental health issues and was poorly handled by university officials as the 22-year-old sought to re-take a chemistry test. The Orange County District Attorneys Office alleged last year when he was charged that he directed racial slurs at campus security personnel and vandalized security cars with obscenities, a racial slur and a swastika, in addition to slashing tires. McDougal was not charged with a hate crime at the time because prosecutors did not believe they had enough evidence to support that allegation. McDougals trouble started after he took a chemistry test and received a B grade, according to Christl.The student was getting straight As in chemistry at the time, but was taking an exam that required a calculator for two of the 10 questions, Christl explained. He didnt have his calculator with him and he was too afraid to ask for one, so he failed to get the A for missing the two questions, the attorney said.McDougal obsessed over the exam and wanted to re-take it, according to Christl. The teacher agreed to let McDougal re-take the exam with a calculator after class, but he showed up too early and walked into the middle of class, according to Christl. He said his client was told to wait in the hallway, where he paced back and forth. Apparently, the chemistry teacher didnt like that, so she alerted the schools director of mental health, who a day before told Robert he was not in trouble, Christl said last year. The director of mental health, accompanied by two security guards, went to the classroom, Christl said.And just when the bell was about ready to ring and the class was ready to get out, Robert runs into the classroom, and with the security guards chasing him, hes running around the classroom saying, I have my calculator, Christl said.

718,"After scuffling with an Anaheim smoke shop manager a 54-year-old transient will appear in court for hate crime charges, authorities say. Robert Kevin Pressler was charged Friday with a felony hate crime and a misdemeanor count of possession of methamphetamine, according to court records. Pressler allegedly walked back and forth in front of a smoke shop on the 80 block of E. Orangethorpe Ave. last Wednesday shouting white power and stay white, said Anaheim police Sgt. Daron Wyatt. According to court documents obtained by Patch, Pressler allegedly battered the store manager, for the purpose of intimidating him. The store employee, of Middle Eastern descent, confronted Pressler, who threw a 32-ounce soda cup at the man and then got into a scuffle with the victim, Wyatt alleged at the incident.

719,"A Fullerton homeowner interrupted two people breaking into his home Wednesday and was subjected to racial taunts and assault, according to police. On Saturday morning, an 18-year-old Long Beach man and a 17-year-old girl are both behind bars in relation to that crime. Officers responded at just before 10:15 a.m. Wednesday to a report of a possible residential robbery in the 1600 block of Island Drive. They learned from the homeowner that he had arrived home and was confronted by two suspects who already were inside, Fullerton police Sgt. Jon Radus said. After putting the victim in the closet, the suspects continued to ransack the home. They were caught on surveillance cameras leaving the residence with stolen items, Radus said. The victim was finally able to call police once the suspects fled and he was able to free himself from being tied up in the closet. Detectives were able to identify two people they believe are responsible: Alatini Moli of Long Beach and a 17-year-old girl whose name was withheld due to her age. Both were arrested and booked on suspicion of residential robbery, residential burglary, kidnapping, false imprisonment, assault and battery, conspiracy and a hate crime. Moli was booked into the Fullerton city jail and the girl was booked into Orange County Juvenile Hall. During the commission of the crime, the suspects made statements to (the victim) about his race, and his race being a factor in the why the suspects were committing the crimes against him, Radus said in explaining the hate crime allegations. Moli, a construction worker, is due in court Monday, according to online inmate records. Fullerton Police Department photo",1,0,3
720,"A racial slur was spray-painted on the front gate of Cleveland Cavaliers forward LeBron James home in West Los Angeles area, police said. The graffiti, which included the N-word, was spray-painted overnight on the outer gate of the home in Brentwood, Los Angeles police Officer Aareon Jefferson told Patch. No arrests have been made, he said. The graffiti was painted over by the time police arrived Wednesday morning, he said. According to the gossip site TMZ.com, police are looking for security footage from neighbors that may show the suspect or suspects. According to real estate records, James bought the home in 2015, but TMZ reports that the NBA star does not live there on a regular basis. James was not at home at the time of the incident. He is in the Bay Area gearing up for Game 1 of the NBA Finals against the Golden State Warriors, which starts Thursday. James told reporters in Oakland his family was not harmed, and thats the most important. It just goes to show that racism will always be a part of the world, a part of America, he said. James said the first thing he thought of when he heard about the vandalism was Emmett Till, a black teen who was lynched in Mississippi in 1955. Tills mother insisted on an open-casket funeral to publicly show the violent way her 14-year-old son was killed. The reason she had an open casket is she wanted to show the world what her son went through as far as a hate crime and being black in America, James said. No matter how much money you have, no matter how famous you are, no matter how many people admire you, being black in America is tough and weve got a long way to go, he said. James, 32, said the crime in Brentwood would not distract him from the NBA Finals, but he said it re-emphasized his priorities. At the end of the day, Ill be focused tomorrow on our game plan, and focused on these games, he said. But ... Im at a point in my life where my priorities are in place. Basketball comes second to my family. It actually comes after me continuing to be a role model to the youth and what I do as far as with my foundation. ... I will be as focused as I can be on the job at hand tomorrow, but this is a situation where it just puts me back in place of whats more important, and basketball is not the most important thing in my life.

721,"Racist messages spray-painted at Palisades Charter High School spark student protest https://t.co/Fsyafm30DU pic.twitter.com/W8q94wINrM  PACIFIC PALISADES- Police today arrested two Palisades Charter High School students allegedly responsible for hate-speech vandalism at their school. The students were released to the custody of their parents, Los Angeles Police Department Lt. Tina Nieto said. Because they are juveniles, their names will not be released. Detectives conducted an extensive series of interviews, leading to the arrest of two suspects, police said. One was cited for vandalism and released to his parents. The other was cited for conspiracy to commit vandalism and released to his parents. Both of the subjects are current students at Palisades Charter High School, the statement continued. The investigation has not revealed a credible threat or danger to students or the community. Graffiti that included swastikas and made references to gays and the KKK was spray-painted on Palisades Charter High School, 15777 Bowdoin St., over the weekend. The vandalism is believed to have been committed about 6 a.m. Sunday. The suspects defaced the schools iconic mural, as well as a bus stop, the sidewalk and several trees with spray paint, police said. The arrests were announced within hours of Councilman Mike Bonins introduction of a motion to offer a $50,000 reward in the case. Bonin said whoever was responsible represents an ongoing threat to the safety of the people of Los Angeles. Bonin added he was horrified by the awful, disgusting and offensive hate speech graffiti left around the school, which serves students from Pacific Palisades, Palisades Highlands, Kenter Canyon and portions of Brentwood. We cannot allow hate and intolerance to threaten our neighborhoods and our school children, Bonin said. Anyone with further information was asked to call detectives at (310) 444-1588.

723,"A man accused of drugging and raping multiple men over a seven-year period starting in 2007 pleaded not guilty Friday to 41 felony counts related to the accusations, according to the San Mateo County District Attorneys Office. Prosecutors say that Joseph Paul Courtney, 31, of Pacifica, met three different men for consensual sex and allegedly ended up drugging them into unconsciousness before raping them. Courtney allegedly raped the men along with unidentified male associates, according to prosecutors. On at least one occasion, after regaining consciousness, the victim was allegedly shown a video recording of multiple men engaged in sex with him while he was passed out, prosecutors said. One of the men who saw such a recording of himself reported the alleged rape to Pacifica police, said District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe. At least 14 additional victims then came forward after media reports of the crimes, Wagstaffe said. Additionally, Courtney allegedly raped the men in full knowledge that he has AIDS, according to Wagstaffe. Courtneys attorney, Steve Chase, said all of the sex his client had was consensual and that he denies ever having sex while any of the men were unconscious. The alleged victims in the case met Courtney on a gay dating website or via a smart phone app and they expected to take drugs and have sex, Chase said. This case is so beyond the pale of the normal criminal case, Chase said. It is a different world that these men are in. Courtney has been charged with 41 counts of sodomy by force, sodomy of an unconscious person, continuous sexual assault and drugging his alleged victims. Because of a multiple victim enhancement to the charges, Courtney faces either 15 or 20 years to life in prison for each count, Wagstaffe said. Courtney is scheduled to appear in San Mateo County Superior Court in Redwood City on July 31 for the start of his jury trail. - Bay City News / Image via Shutterstock",1,4,0
724,"Laws to protect Californians from DUI offenders, help establish an earthquake early warning system, reform the California Public Utilities Commission, increase oversight of building contractors, require police to securely stow any handgun left in a car, improve tour bus safety, crack down on water-guzzling households, and more take effect on January 1. The new laws are the result of 17 bills that were introduced by Senator Jerry Hill, passed by the Legislature and signed by Governor Jerry Brown in 2016. Here are summaries of the bills that led to the new laws and what they do: Senate Bill 24 – JPA Pension Fix for San Mateo County Resolves a pension problem that prevented the cities of San Mateo, Belmont and Foster City from completing their Joint Powers Agreement for shared fire service. It allows the three cities to provide the JPA employees a defined benefit plan that those employees received as classic CalPERS members from their previous employment with the cities. San Mateo County Firefighters and the California Professional Firefighters supported SB 24, along with the cities of San Mateo, Belmont and Foster City. SB 62 – California Public Utilities Commission Office of the Safety Advocate Establishes the Office of the Safety Advocate within the California Public Utilities Commission to advocate for continuous, cost-effective improvement of safety management and safety performance of public utilities. SB 438 – Earthquake Early Warning Implementation Complements the $10 million included in the 2016-2017 budget for the statewide earthquake early warning system by establishing the Earthquake Early Warning Advisory Board within the Governors Office of Emergency Services. The new law brings California closer to statewide implementation of the earthquake early warning system. In emergencies, the alerts sent by the warning system will help prevent devastating and life-threatening missteps. Governor Browns announcement of his signing the bill is here and view video of the press conference held at the Office of Emergency Services headquarters here. SB 465 – Building Construction Contractors: Discipline, Reporting and Building Standards SB 465 is aimed at increasing oversight of contractors by closing the gaps in information that were revealed by the collapse of a balcony at a Berkeley apartment building on June 16, 2015. Ashley Donohoe, 22, of Rohnert Park, her cousin, Olivia Burke, 21, of Ireland, and four of their friends were killed. Seven other students from Ireland, including Aoife Beary who had been celebrating her 21st birthday, were hospitalized for weeks after the balcony gave way and sent them plummeting five stories to the ground. Aoife Beary, her mother Angela, Ashley Donohoes mother, Jackie, and representatives of the Irish Consulate testified to policy committees in the Capitol about the devastating loss felt by families from California to Ireland – and urged legislators to support SB 465, which was co-authored by Senator Loni Hancock, D-Oakland. The new law: SB 512 – Governance, Accountability and Transparency at the California Public Utilities Commission SB 512 reforms the governance structure of the California Public Utilities Commission by more clearly outlining the roles and responsibilities of commissioners and staff, and by requiring the CPUC to reach out to communities affected by CPUC decisions, instead of only to regulated utilities. To do so, SB 512 makes the following statutory changes: It 1) requires the commission to annually approve performance criteria for the commission and the executive director, and to annually evaluate the performance of the executive director based on those criteria; 2) requires the CPUC to reach out to those affected by its proceedings; 3) requires CPUC judges to adhere to ethics provisions of the Administrative Procedures Act; 4) allows the public to receive hearing transcripts at no charge; 5) permits the CPUC to meet in locations other than San Francisco; 6) requires the CPUC to modify its annual report to clarify how long the CPUC takes to finish rate or penalty cases; and 7) allows local governments to receive intervenor compensation when participating in CPUC efforts to improve safety, enabling local governments that have suffered catastrophes to seek such compensation. SB 661 – The Dig Safe Act of 2016 SB 661 addresses safety problems involving excavations and gas pipelines that are beneath soil or are otherwise underground by making clarifications to the so-called one-call law (Call 811 before you dig) and by creating the Safe Excavation Board, an appointed board of excavation stakeholders that is funded by fees on utilities. The board is to 1) investigate accidents and other one-call violations; 2) develop standards for safe excavation; and 3) coordinate education and outreach efforts. SB 812 – Improving Tour Bus Safety Improves the safety and oversight of tour buses operating in California by strengthening the California Highway Patrols tour bus inspection program. The law was prompted by a tour bus accident in San Franciscos Union Square in November 2015 that injured 20 people, at least five critically. After the crash, the CHP determined that the bus had never been inspected and was not registered with the California Public Utilities Commission, as is required by law. The CHP later conducted a surprise inspection of the companys bus fleet and found over 60 violations, 29 for mechanical problems. SB 814 – Cracking Down on Water-Guzzling Households During a Drought A winner of Senator Hills 2016 Oughta Be a Law…Or Not bill idea contest for constituents, SB 814 pulls the plug on excessive water use by households that flout mandatory reductions during drought emergencies. The law requires urban retail water suppliers to set rules for identifying and cracking down on households that consume enormous amounts of water despite restrictions imposed during a statewide declaration of a drought. The new law ensures that every urban retail water supplier has a tool to curb excessive water use by customers. Households that guzzle water – while neighbors and most other Californians abide by mandatory reductions – will no longer be able to hide and persist in their excess. SB 869 – Safe Storage of Police Handguns in Vehicles Another winner of Senator Hills 2016 Oughta Be a Law… contest, SB 869 responds to numerous thefts of handguns that law enforcement officers had left in cars. The stolen firearms included guns used in two murders in the Bay Area. SB 869 closes a legal loophole that had exempted law enforcement officers as well as concealed weapons permit holders from requirements to securely stow handguns in a lockbox out of plain view, or in the trunk, if the weapons are left in an unattended vehicle. SB 996 – Affordable Housing Property Tax Cap Aids local nonprofit and religious organizations that provide affordable housing by increasing the assessed property value exemption from $2,000,000 annually to $10,000,000 annually. The new law applies to three local nonprofits, such as the Saint Francis Center in Redwood City and the Ministry Services of the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul based in Los Altos Hills, which provides housing, food and clothing services to low-income families. SB 996 provides property tax relief to such organizations so that they can continue to provide more affordable housing for low income people and families. SB 1004 – Young Adult Offender Pilot Program Hailed by Governor Brown for its innovation, SB 1004 authorizes a pilot program in five counties, including Santa Clara, to give nonviolent young adult offenders between the ages of 18 and 21 the opportunity to take advantage of supportive and educational services in the juvenile justice system, rather than serve their time in an adult county jail. Although legally considered adults, these young offenders are still undergoing significant brain development, and may be better served by the juvenile justice system with age-appropriate, intensive services. Research shows that people do not develop adult-caliber, decision-making skills until their early 20s. Psychologists note that this maturity gap makes young adults more likely to engage in risk-seeking behavior. SB 1028 – Utility Wildfire Mitigation Plans SB 1028 requires 1) utilities regulated by the California Public Utilities Commission to file wildfire mitigation plans, 2) the CPUC to review those plans, and 3) publicly-owned utilities to also file wildfire mitigation plans with their governing boards. SB 1039 – Business and Professions Omnibus Bill SB 1039 makes several changes to the statutes governing various boards and bureaus under the Department of Consumer Affairs; includes specified fee increases for several boards including the Dental Hygiene Committee of California, the California Board of Optometry, the Board of Registered Nursing, the Board of Pharmacy, and the Contractors State License Board; and eliminates the Telephone Medical Advice Services Bureau. SB 1039 specifies that the continuing education standards established for nurses by the Board of Registered Nursing shall recognize specialized areas of practice, as previously required, and require that content be relevant to the practice of nursing, be related to the scientific knowledge or technical skills required for the practice of nursing, or be related to direct or indirect patient or client care. The legislation requires the nursing board to audit continuing education providers at least once every five years to ensure adherence to regulatory requirements. The new law also requires the board to withhold or rescind approval from any provider that is in violation of the regulatory requirements. SB 1046 – Ignition Interlock Devices for Drunk Driving Offenders Extends a pilot program requiring drunk driving offenders in Alameda, Los Angeles, Sacramento and Tulare counties to install the devices known as IIDs. IIDs are calibrated to the driver and prevent a car from starting if the driver is not sober. The four-county pilot would run until January 1, 2019, when the program would be expanded statewide with minor modifications so that: SB 1046 also creates an early incentive program, providing DUI offenders with full driving privileges soon after arrest if they install an IID. Their ultimate IID time requirement would be reduced based on when the early installation occurred. Low income offenders would be eligible for assistance to pay for an IID based on a sliding scale pegged to household income. SB 1192 – Private Post-Secondary Education SB 1192 changes the California Private Post-Secondary Education Act of 2009 to improve the effectiveness of the Bureau for Private Post-Secondary Education and opportunities for student success, and extends the BPPEs operations for four years. SB 1193 – Healing Arts, Board of Pharmacy, Veterinary Medical Board Sunset Bill SB 1193 makes changes to the Pharmacy Law, Veterinary Practice Act and Psychology Licensing Law to strengthen the laws and improve oversight of licensees by these boards. SB 1196 – Professions and Vocations: Bureau of Real Estate, Bureau of Real Estate Appraisers, and Bureau of Security and Investigative Services Bill SB 1196 ensures that the Bureau of Security and Investigative Services is subject to review by the appropriate policy committees of the Legislature. The legislation changes provisions in the Alarm Company Act, the Locksmith Act, the Private Investigator Act, the Private Security Services Act, Proprietary Security Services Act, and Collateral Recovery Act to improve the oversight, enforcement and regulation of licensees by the bureau. The bill also adds a sunset review date for the Bureau of Real Estate and the Bureau of Real Estate Appraisers, and changes existing laws to improve oversight, enforcement and regulation by the CalBRE and BREA. SB 1196 includes several consumer protection and public safety reforms to operations and oversight by the Bureau of Security and Investigative Services, which licenses about 380,000 companies and employees that provide alarm services, locksmith services, private investigation, private security, repossession services and firearm and baton training. The changes are intended to ensure that an applicant for licensure as an armed security guard is capable of exercising appropriate judgment, restraint and self-control; that armed security guards are qualified for their jobs, and that California regulators step up their policing of the industry. SB 1196 also imposes stricter training standards and requirements to ensure that shootings and incidents of suspected excessive force are investigated. In addition, the new law enables gun permits to be revoked when warranted and improves oversight of companies. – SUBMITTED FOR PUBLICATION BY: Office of State Senator Jerry Hill / Image via Shutterstock",0,8,5
725,"A man who accidentally shot himself during an alleged attempt to kill a black employee at a Desert Hot Springs auto parts store must stand trial for attempted murder and hate crime charges, a judge ruled Wednesday. Rudy Arana, 19, allegedly brought a sawed-off shotgun to an Autozone store on March 30, and following a tussle with the employee that brought both men to the ground, shot himself in the lower body, according to Desert Hot Springs police. The employee testified Wednesday that as the work day started, he saw Arana trying to get into his car in the parking lot. He told Arana to leave, but he allegedly returned a short time later and asked other employees where the victim was, while calling himself an N-word killer, according to court documents. After continuing to loiter near the store, Arana saw the employee he was seeking when the worker left the store to take out the trash, the victim testified. As they wrestled for control of the gun, Arana allegedly cursed at the employee and referred to him using the N-word, saying, Im going to kill you, the victim testified. He said two shots were fired during the struggle, including the shot that struck Arana. Arana was taken to a hospital for treatment of his injuries and was later placed under arrest. No one else was injured in the shooting. Arana was later charged with attempted murder, along with multiple sentence-enhancing allegations, including hate crime, firearm and gang allegations. He will return to court Aug. 2 for a post-preliminary hearing arraignment. He remains jailed on $1 million bail. – By City News Service / Image via Shutterstock",1,0,0
726,"PALM SPRINGS, CA- A suspect who was shot and killed by a Palm Springs policeman last year grabbed the officers gun holster, prompting him to shoot the man twice in the stomach, according to a district attorneys report released Friday that concludes the shooting was justified. Abraham Ortiz, 26, of Desert Hot Springs, was shot just after 1:30 p.m. last Nov. 4 in the parking lot of a Rite Aid store at 366 S. Palm Canyon Drive. The District Attorneys Office found that Officer David Etchason, a two- year member of the department, was justified in firing on Ortiz because he believed the suspect was trying to grab his gun while he and another officer attempted to handcuff him in the parking lot. The officers were initially called to the business because Ortiz was making threatening statements and racial and homophobic slurs, and was seen urinating in public and exposing himself, Palm Springs police Chief Bryan Reyes told reporters on the day of the shooting. In addition to a witness hearing the racial and homophobic slurs, the assistant manager of the Rite Aid said Ortiz stole a shirt from the store, then threatened him with a knife when confronted, according to the determination letter sent to Reyes and signed by District Attorney Mike Hestrin and Chief Assistant District Attorney John Aki. Etchason, along with Officer Michael Heron and Community Service Officer Juan Vasquez, searched Ortiz at the scene and found a screwdriver, methamphetamine and pipes on him, according to the D.A.s findings. The officers sat him down on a curb, but as they attempted to search him for further contraband, Ortiz began resisting and demanded his things back. The officers finally decided to handcuff him, which is when Ortiz latched onto Etchasons lower body, then reached for his gun, according to the letter. Etchason told investigators he believed Ortiz was grabbing for his gun to kill me with it. And then kill Mike (Heron) with it, kill Juan (Vasquez) with it, so he needed to be stopped. Heron also told investigators that he saw Ortizs hands near Etchasons gun and a civilian in the parking lot saw Ortizs arm around Etchasons waist and that it did look like he was going for his gun and the officer had every right to pull his gun out. Concerned that Ortiz could remove his gun and shoot him or the other officers, Officer Etchason removed his weapon and fired two shots into Ortizs stomach, the letter concludes. Officer Etchason acted in reasonable self- defense and he therefore bears no criminal responsibility for his actions. The determination letter also states that Ortiz had a history of erratic behavior, prompting his family to call the police on him in 2015. Four officers were needed to restrain him that day, while in 2016, he was seen at a gas station brandishing a knife, according to the D.A. The shooting came at a tense time for Palm Springs police, less than a month after the Oct. 8 shooting deaths of Palm Springs police Officers Jose Gilbert Vega and Lesley Zerebny. Vega, 63, and Zerebny, 27, were gunned down as they responded to a family disturbance call at a Palm Springs residence. A third officer was wounded in the gunfire. Their alleged killer, 26-year-old John Hernandez Felix, remains in custody, facing charges of murder, attempted murder and numerous firearm- related felonies. – By City News Service / Patch file photo",1,0,3
727,"The names of fallen Palm Springs police officers Jose Gil Vega and Lesley Zerebny were added Monday to the states peace officer memorial monument during a ceremony at the state Capitol. Vega and Zerebny were among 13 other officers memorialized during the 41st annual California Peace Officers Memorial Ceremony in Sacramento. The California Peace Officers Memorial Monument, which is on the Capitol grounds, includes the names of more than 1,500 fallen police officers who have been killed in the line of duty. Along with Vega and Zerebny, eight other officers who were killed in the line of duty last year were memorialized, as were five who died in previous years. Palm Springs police Chief Bryan Reyes was the keynote speaker at the ceremony, which also included a memorial procession of law enforcement vehicles and a Walk of Honor for the families of fallen officers. During an impassioned speech, Reyes decried state legislation that he believes put officers lives at risk. Though he did not specifically name Proposition 47 or Assembly Bill 109, which redefined punishments for non-violent offenders in a bid to reduce prison overcrowding, Reyes said the officers deaths put into focus the Assembly bills and propositions responsible for the watering down of our justice system -- a comment that drew sustained applause from the crowd. The further that society drifts from the truth, the more it will hate those that speak it. If I am hated, it just shows how much we have drifted, Reyes said. He praised the family members of officers for their support of their loved ones. Know they went to work that fatal day loving what they do because of the support of you, he told family members attending the ceremony. Know that theres always someone within our law enforcement profession to lean on during your time in need. Vega, 63, and Zerebny, 27, were killed last Oct. 8 after responding to a family disturbance call. John Hernandez Felix, 26, allegedly fired on the officers through the metal screen door of his home, striking Vega, Zerebny, and a third officer who survived his injuries. Their deaths marked the first time a Palm Springs police officer had been killed in the line of duty since Jan. 1, 1962, when Officer Lyle Wayne Larrabee died during a vehicle pursuit. The only other death in the department was that of Officer Gale Gene Eldridge, who was fatally shot on Jan. 18, 1961, while investigating an armed robbery. Vega had been with the department for 35 years -- five years past his retirement eligibility -- and had planned to finish his career last December. Zerebny had been with the department for about 18 months and had just returned to duty from maternity leave after the birth of a daughter. – By City News Service / Images credit: PSPD",0,8,5
728,"A Coachella Valley sheriffs deputy was to be honored by the Anti-Defamation League Tuesday for her work in helping capture the man who firebombed a Coachella mosque in 2015. Deputy Sheriff Yadira Perez was honored with the Helene and Joseph Sherwood Prize for Combating Hate during the ADLs event in Los Angeles, which also honored several members of law enforcement. Perez is recognized for her contribution toward the apprehension of Carl James Dial, who was sentenced to six years in state prison for tossing a Molotov cocktail through the window of the Islamic Center of the Coachella Valley. Dial pleaded guilty to arson, as well as sentence-enhancing allegations of using an explosive device and committing a hate crime. While off-duty on Dec. 11, 2015, Perez saw Dial running from the scene of the flaming mosque and was able to provide an accurate suspect description that led to his arrest. According to an ADL statement, Even while off-duty, Deputy Perez exhibited her steadfast commitment to keep our community safe. The mosques Imam Reymundo Nour was scheduled to speak on Perezs contribution toward the resolution of the case.

729,"- In what was billed Monday as the first systematic analysis of police body camera footage, research conducted at Stanford University showed that police officers consistently use less respectful language with black community members than with white community members, according to a news release from the university. Although they are subtle, these widespread racial disparities in officers language use may erode police-community relations, said the researchers who conducted the study, published June 5 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Our findings highlight that, on the whole, police interactions with black community members are more fraught than their interactions with white community members, said Jennifer Eberhardt, co-author of the study and professor of psychology at Stanford. The racial disparities in respectful speech remained even after the researchers controlled for the race of the officer, the severity of the infraction, and the location and outcome of the stop. To analyze the body camera footage, a multidisciplinary team from Stanfords psychology, linguistics and computer science departments first developed a new artificial intelligence technique for measuring levels of respect in officers language. They then applied this technique to the transcripts from 981 traffic stops the Oakland Police Department made in a single month. The researchers novel technique demonstrated that white residents were 57 percent more likely than black residents to hear a police officer say the most respectful utterances, such as apologies and expressions of gratitude like thank you. Meanwhile, black community members were 61 percent more likely than white residents to hear an officer say the least respectful utterances, such as informal titles like dude and bro and commands like hands on the wheel. To be clear: There was no swearing, said Dan Jurafsky, a study co-author and Stanford professor of linguistics and of computer science. These were well-behaved officers. But the many small differences in how they spoke with community members added up to pervasive racial disparities. The fact that we now have the technology and methods to show these patterns is a huge advance for behavioral science, computer science and the policing industry, said Rob Voigt, a Stanford linguistics doctoral student and lead author of the study. Police departments can use these tools not only to diagnose problems in police-community relations but also to develop solutions.

730,"A Millbrae man pleaded no contest last week in San Mateo County Superior Court to committing a hate crime in which he called another man a derogatory name before hitting him near a Redwood City gas station the day after the U.S. presidential election, prosecutors said today. Around 11 p.m. on Nov. 9, Michael Goggins, 34, showed up to the Chevron gas station at 2215 El Camino Real, according to the district attorneys office. Goggins then yelled at an employee Why are you in my country? and accused him of being lazy, prosecutors said. When the employee called police, responding officers found Goggins at a nearby warehouse on Laurel Street. Goggins ignored multiple commands from officers and allegedly tried to bite officers as they were arresting him. After he was arrested, Goggins talked about hitting a Mexican and said aliens were invading the country, according to prosecutors. Officers took Goggins to a hospital, where he was given a psychological evaluation. Following his arrest, police were able to locate another victim. The victim said Goggins had approached him and his friend that day as they were walking on Willow Street. Goggins allegedly said to the victim in Spanish, Im white, Im from here. Where are you from, wetback? He then punched the victim in the chest, prosecutors said. On Wednesday, Goggins pleaded no contest to making felony threats to a police officer and a misdemeanor hate crime for violating a victims civil rights. The no contest plea comes with the condition that he wont serve no more than 120 days in county jail and will be referred for consideration into a mental health program, according to prosecutors. Goggins will appear next in court on Friday for sentencing. He remains in custody on $50,000 bail, prosecutors said. Goggins defense attorney was not immediately available for comment. The hate crime case is one of many reported nationwide following the election of Donald Trump as president. During the campaign, Trump called for a wall to be built between the U.S. and Mexico and threatened to deport millions of undocumented immigrants. ALSO SEE: --Bay City News/Shutterstock image",1,0,0
731,"PALO ALTO - A Palo Alto man has been arrested on suspicion of committing two hate crimes after an altercation in late May between the man and a taxi driver. According to Palo Alto police, 52-year-old David Charles Cirner of Palo Alto allegedly assaulted the cab driver following a parking dispute at the Palo Alto transit center on Friday, May 27, just before 7 p.m. Police say Cirner was sitting in his black 2015 Toyota Camry in the parking lot on Urban Lane, just south of University Circle, when the cab driver, a man in his forties from India, drove up in his Ford Crown Victoria taxi cab and stopped in the roadway, partially behind Cirners vehicle. According to police, the cab driver said he got out and asked Cirner, whose vehicle was allegedly parked in two parking spots, if he would move his car into one spot or the other so the taxi could park in the second spot. Palo Alto police claim Cirner suddenly began yelling racial epithets at the driver, who backed off and got back into the taxi. Cirner got out of his car, approached the passenger side door of the taxi, and attempted to punch the driver while continuing to yell racial epithets, according to police. At one point during the escalating situation, after the taxi driver took out his cell phone to try to take a picture of Cirner, police say Cirner went to the drivers side window of the cab, punched the driver once in the jaw, and grabbed the taxi drivers cell phone out of his hand. According to police, Cirner then threw the drivers cell phone back at him, striking the driver in the head so hard that the phones screen cracked. Palo Alto police say Cirner then returned to his own car, and allegedly backed it twice into the taxicab while attempting to leave the parking spot. Cirner finally fled after jumping a curb, and drove away westbound on University Circle. Palo Alto police caught up with him as he was travelling southbound on Alma Street. Palo Alto police say at least two independent witnesses observed the incident, and one of them called police. The taxi driver complained of pain to his jaw, according to officials, but did not require medical attention at the scene. Both vehicles sustained minor damage as a result of the two collisions. Police booked David Charles Cirner into the Santa Clara County Main Jail for felony robbery (for taking the victims cell phone by force), two misdemeanor counts of hate crimes (one for the physical assault, the other for damaging personal property), and misdemeanor hit-and-run.

732,"A sign reads Why? in English, French and Flemish at a memorial near the Maelbeek metro station in Brussels, after terrorist attacks on Tuesday. BY STEVE FYFFE The coordinated suicide bombings that killed at least 30 people and wounded hundreds more at an international airport and downtown subway station in Brussels on Tuesday were shocking but not surprising and shared many of the hallmarks of previous European terror attacks, according to Stanford terrorism experts. My research shows that in general, terrorist plots in Europe involve larger numbers of conspirators than do plots in the United States, said Martha Crenshaw, a senior fellow at Stanfords Center for International Security and Cooperation (CISAC). Belgian authorities said as many as five people may have been involved in the bombings, including two Belgian-born brothers with violent criminal records, and that several suspects were linked to the terrorist network that carried out the deadly Paris attacks last November. It is common for terrorist conspiracies anywhere to be formed from prior social groupings – friends and relatives, Crenshaw said. The bonds that link individuals are not entirely ideological by any means. Criminal backgrounds are also not surprising. Indeed, prison radicalization is a well-known phenomenon. A notorious neighborhood Many of the suspects in the Brussels bombings had ties to the inner-city neighborhood of Molenbeek, a majority Muslim enclave of mostly Moroccan descent with a long history as a logistical base for jihadists. French and Belgian police arrested Salah Abdeslam, who had been identified as the last surviving member of the 10-man team responsible for the Paris attacks and an apparent associate of the Brussels bombers, near his family home in Molenbeek just four days before the Brussels attacks. Brussels and particularly Molenbeek is one of those places that comes up a lot when youre talking about counterterrorism, said Terrence Peterson, a postdoctoral fellow at CISAC. You do have terrorism networks that use these areas, in the same way that organized crime does, to thrive. … It seems to be the place where all the networks are locating, in part because Belgian security hasnt been very effective in fighting terrorism. Source of foreign fighters Belgium is a small nation, with a population of around 11 million people, but it has the highest per capita percentage of any Western country of foreign fighters who have joined the battle in Iraq and Syria, according to a recent report, which estimated the total number at 440 people. People were even saying it was not a matter of if but when Belgium was attacked, said Joe Felter, a CISAC senior research scholar and former colonel in the U.S. Army Special Forces. Youve got a high concentration of radicalized individuals in that neighborhood of Brussels, so logistically it was easier for them to recruit, plan and coordinate the execution of these attacks, he said. Local residents loading up explosive-packed suitcases in a cab and driving across town to the airport exposes them to much less risk of compromise than would a plot requiring cross-border preparation and movement by foreign citizens. Felter said he was concerned that the Brussels bombings, for which the Islamic State group has claimed responsibility, would inspire copycat attacks in other countries. The real risk now is these home-grown, self-directed terrorist attacks, he said. A successful attack like this, with all its media attention and publicity, is only going to inspire and motivate more attempts going forward. Beyond Belgium Other European countries such as Denmark, which also has been struggling to deal with a high percentage of foreign fighters, are trying to proactively discourage citizens from travelling to Syria to fight, said Anja Dalgaard-Nielsen, former executive director of the Danish Security and Intelligence Service and a CISAC affiliate. Politicians are likely to talk about tougher legislation, but there are also measured voices, calling for a strong, long-term, preventive effort against radicalization to prevent problems from growing out of hand, Dalgaard-Nielsen said. Police need to prioritize community outreach and long-term trust building to try to ensure the collaboration of minority groups and socioeconomically disadvantaged communities in the effort against terrorism. Stanford political science Professor David Laitin, co-author of the recently published book Why Muslim Integration Fails in Christian-Heritage Societies, said his research found that Muslims faced higher discrimination in the economy, in society and in the political process compared with Christians from similar immigrant backgrounds. But there is no evidence that higher degrees of discrimination lead Muslims into the unspeakable acts that members of an inhuman cult are performing in the name of Islam, said Laitin, who is the James T. Watkins IV and Elise V. Watkins Professor in the School of Humanities and Sciences. From what we have tragically seen, the attractiveness of the present murderous cult does not derive from everyday discrimination, he said. Research has shown that it is not the poor and downtrodden who are radicalized in this way, but rather reasonably educated, second-generation immigrants from largely secular backgrounds. Europe divided Laitin said he expected to see many European countries tighten their border controls in response to the Brussels attacks, as well as greater support in the United Kingdom for the movement to leave the European Union in the upcoming referendum. The biggest short-term effect, in my judgment, will be the erosion of one of the great achievements of European integration, namely Schengen, which promised open borders throughout the continent, Laitin said. I foresee greater security walls that will come to divide European countries. Fighting a hostile ideology Felter said that while it is undoubtedly important to improve intelligence sharing and invest in greater security measures as part of concerted efforts to target the Islamic State group and interdict future terrorist plots, the key to undermining support for and defeating ISIS is combating its perverted version of Islam. And, he said, that effort would have to come largely from within the Islamic community itself. The symptoms may be suicide bombers in airports, but the root cause is this hostile ideology thats being pushed on these at-risk individuals through aggressive radicalization and recruitment efforts carried out largely via the Internet that then inspires them to carry out these self-directed, ISIS-inspired attacks, Felter said. Theres got to be a longer-term effort to address the root causes of this, to discredit and delegitimize the appeal of this ideology that theyre promulgating online and through social media thats inspiring these young men and women to go off and commit these horrible acts in the misguided belief that it is their religious obligation to do so. -Stanford News Service, image via AP Photo / Martin Meissner)",1,3,0
733,"The following is a collection of weekly police, court and fire stories from around the Palos Verdes area this week. The victim was pushed to the ground by one of the suspects at a South Bay Starbucks. The 18-year-old is accused of driving the getaway car in a fatal South Los Angeles shooting.F The man was holding an Airsoft or pellet gun that was very realistic-looking, Sheriffs Lt. Rodney Moore told reporters. Police responding to a report of a gunman in Redondo Beach shot and killed the suspect, who turned out to be armed with a pellet gun. One suspect is outstanding after the early morning search near Marine Avenue and Walnut Avenue. Police say the suspect was captured on video surveillance using credit cards stolen from the vehicle burglaries. The woman was in a car when she was shot, according to reports from the scene. The 52-year-old man left a suicide note before departing from his home last week. She was found about 9 p.m. Tuesday, according to Long Beach police.

734,"A onetime South Bay resident was sentenced Monay to seven decades in federal prison for traveling repeatedly to Cambodia to molest impoverished children, four of whom testified to grueling sexual attacks that had jurors holding back tears. Ronald John Boyajian was found guilty in March of federal counts of international travel with intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct with minors, engaging in illicit sexual conduct with a minor in foreign places, and commission of a felony offense involving a minor while required to register as a sex offender. Boyajian — who was previously convicted more than 20 years ago on nearly two dozen counts of statutory rape in Orange County — declined to participate in his sentencing hearing, telling the court he was unprepared to go forward. Calling Boyajians crimes extremely, extremely serious, U.S. District Judge Christina Snyder imposed the 70-year sentence, ordering lifetime supervised release and mandatory sex offender registration if he is ever released from federal prison. Boyajian, acting as his own attorney, kept the case at a stalemate for seven years prior to the start of the six-week trial in Los Angeles. The case docket has more than 1,500 entries, most of them motions filed almost daily by Boyajian in which he objected to each aspect of the proceedings and accused the judge of conspiring against him behind the scenes. His latest attempt to delay sentencing was denied late last week by Snyder. Federal cases are very complex, especially when there are international aspects and witnesses from abroad, Eileen M. Decker, the U.S. attorney in Los Angeles, told City News Service. We expect these cases to take many years. We are in a unique situation to do this. If we do not address this terrible crime, we fear it would go unpunished. Three women in their 20s, who were children when they were sexually assaulted by the defendant, gave brief victim impact statements last week, telling the judge that the attacks had lasting, painful impacts on their lives. Speaking through a translator, one of the women urged the judge not to allow this man to leave prison because possibly there are other children out there that it could happen to — just like it happened to me. Crying, she said, I dont want this to happen to other children. I want other children to have a happy life. Another woman told the court that since she was attacked by Boyajian more than seven years ago, she fears men and often finds herself grouchy for no reason. Boyajian, 55, who once lived in the Palos Verdes area, was sentenced to 30-year terms for each of the two travel offenses and 10 years for committing the offenses while being required by California law to register as a sex offender. It took a federal jury about five hours before returning guilty verdicts on all three counts contained in a federal indictment handed down in September 2009. This case is about a man who wanted to sexually assault children — and he found a place where he could do that, Assistant U.S. Attorney Vanessa Baehr-Jones told the jury at the start of the trial. Boyajian was arrested by the Cambodian National Police in February 2009 while on his 35th trip to Asia over a nine-year period. Boyajian began traveling to Cambodia — one of Southeast Asias poorest countries — shortly after completing his parole following convictions in Orange County for illegal sex with a minor and oral sex with a minor in 1994. Federal prosecutors presented evidence the defendant sexually assaulted girls who were between 8 and 11. One victim, who was 8 when she was molested, testified that he was cruel — he treated me like I wasnt even human. Boyajian paid pimps and sometimes the victims relatives to have access to the children. The attacks took place in the village of Svay Pak — known as Kilo 11 because it is located 11 kilometers outside of Cambodias capital city of Phnom Penh — where the victims were Vietnamese immigrants who lived in the poor community. A Cambodian police anti-human trafficking officer testified that Svay Pak was notorious as a place where foreigners went to have sexual contact with young girls. Boyajian went to Svay Pak to have unlimited access, prosecutors said. One of the females he assaulted — now an adult working in Cambodia to help fellow victims of predators — told jurors that Boyajian paid her grandmother to leave her alone with him in a wooden shack. She described being raped, beaten and bitten on the legs and calves by the defendant during multiple attacks. Boyajian was among the first defendants charged under an international law enforcement initiative specifically targeting Americans traveling to Cambodia for the purpose of sexually abusing children. Operation Twisted Traveler was an effort by the Justice Department and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to crack down on sex tourism. Boyajian has been in custody in Los Angeles since his removal from Cambodia seven years ago. In the years since he was charged, Boyajian lodged a raft of motions and continuances, ensuring the case remained deadlocked. In the minutes before the jury was called into the courtroom for opening statements on Feb. 3, Boyajian made a motion to have Snyder removed from the case. Following the verdicts, the defendant immediately filed motions objecting to the jurys racial mix, among other complaints. The investigation of Boyajian was begun by the Cambodian non- governmental organization Action Pour Les Enfants — APLE — whose investigators said they witnessed Boyajian visiting a child brothel in Svay Pak. It was here — halfway across the world — that foreigners like the defendant could freely target children who were being sold into prostitution, Baehr-Jones told the jury. Boyajian was charged under the Protect Act, which became law in 2003 and made it easier for U.S. authorities to prosecute people for overseas sex crimes. Federal authorities have made more than 70 arrests under the act in countries including Cambodia, Thailand and the Philippines. — City News Service, photo via Shutterstock",1,8,0

The criminal complaint also includes hate crime allegations. He was ordered to return on March 21, when a date is expected to be set for a preliminary hearing to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to proceed to trial. Garcia has been held in lieu of $750,000 bail since his arrest Jan. 25 and, if convicted as charged, faces a maximum sentence of more than 23 years in prison.

The Collaboration of our Federal and local partners and the tireless work of investigators from the various agencies in the task force, made this arrest possible and is a testament to the productive working relationship, first responders have here in Southern California when a community is threatened by criminal activity, said Pasadena Fire Chief Bertral Washington and Pasadena Police chief Philip Sanchez. The case against Garcia will be presented to the Los Angeles County District Attorneys Office on Monday for prosecution, authorities said. Arson and vandalism targeting houses of worship is a serious crime and we have zero-tolerance for willful acts of destruction in the City of Los Angeles, said LAFD Chief Ralph Terrazas and LAPD Chief Charlie Beck said in a written announcement. The destruction of a house of worship not only devastates the affected congregation, but affects the entire community. We will always investigate and prosecute the serious crime of arson to the fullest extent of the law. City News Service contributed to this report. File Photo by AP Photo/Jonathan Chandia",1,3,1
740,"- A fire that damaged a 129-year-old Episcopalian church Saturday morning in Pasadena has prompted an arson investigation. Authorities said the cause of the non-injury fire at Church of the Angels, which was reported at 2:20 a.m. at 1100 N. Avenue 64, just east of the Los Angeles city limits, is being investigated as suspicious. The Los Angeles Fire Department responded and battled the fire at the church as it was originally reported at a Los Angeles address. The Pasadena Fire Department was notified of the blaze after being given a corrected address and is taking over the investigation, according to the LAFDs Amy Bastman. It took 41 LAFD firefighters to knock down the blaze in 14 minutes, Bastman said. In addition to arson investigators, the House of Worship Task Force also was summoned to investigate, according to Bastman. At this time investigators are not calling this a hate crime, but referring to it as arson, graffiti, vandalism and a burglary, said Lisa Derderian of the Pasadena Fire Department. A few historic statues were significantly damaged and there is fire and smoke damage inside the church. The building, which was built in 1889, is the oldest church along the Arroyo Seco waterway, according to the churchs website. Police and fire investigators are on scene and will make notifications to other state and/or federal agencies if the need exists, Derderian said. --City News Service/Photo via Shutterstock",1,3,1
741,"A former Pasadena city employee and two other people were ordered Thursday to stand trial in a case stemming from the alleged embezzlement of millions of dollars from the city. Ex-Pasadena city employee Danny Wooten and co-defendants Tyrone Collins and Melody Jenkins are due back in Los Angeles Superior Court for arraignment April 1, according to Jane Robison of the Los Angeles County District Attorneys Office. Wooten, a 52-year-old former management analyst for Pasadenas Public Works Department, is charged with 20 felony counts each of embezzlement by a public or private officer and public officer crime, along with 19 felony counts of conflict of interest and five felony counts of filing a false tax return. Collins, 56, who owned Collins Electric, is charged with 10 felony counts each of embezzlement by a public or private officer and public officer crime. Prosecutors allege that Wooten directed more than $2 million to Collins. Melody Jenkins, 47, who had been a temporary employee for the city, is charged with one felony count each of embezzlement by a public or private officer, public officer crime and grand theft of personal property. Prosecutors allege that Wooten gave more than $40,000 in city funds to Jenkins. Wooten is also suspected of setting up bank accounts in his name and directing city money to two churches with which he was allegedly affiliated, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorneys Office. The criminal case involves allegations that more than $6 million in city money was embezzled over a decade. Wooten worked for the citys Public Works Department, which was in charge of moving the citys utility lines underground. Wooten is suspected of creating false invoices for the underground utility program between 2004 and March 2014. Along with the money that was allegedly directed to Collins and Jenkins, Wooten also is suspected of setting up bank accounts in his name and directing city money to two religious organizations with which he was affiliated. Wooten was fired by the city July 25 for personnel matters unrelated to the investigation, according to the city. The alleged embezzlement was discovered in 2014 after the city ordered an audit. According to the city, the audit found that Wooten -- a 12-year city employee -- submitted as many as 296 phony invoices to the city. Pasadena city officials announced in January that the city had received $5 million from its insurance carrier to settle a claim involving the alleged embezzlement. The payment represented the maximum amount of money that can be paid in connection with the insurance claim filed by the city, Pasadena city officials said. We are pleased that our insurance carrier has paid the maximum amount on the claim, but in no way does this minimize the importance of our internal efforts to strengthen our financial administration and internal controls, City Manager Michael J. Beck saidt in January. The city has undergone a comprehensive internal financial and personnel audit, changed or increased oversight for many of its financial processes and initiated most of the recommendations announced last year by a citizen advisory task force on financial administration and internal controls, city officials said. The city will continue to pursue legal means necessary to obtain a full recovery of the monies stolen, City Attorney/City Prosecutor Michele Beal Bagneris said. --City News Service, photo via Shutterstock",0,8,5
742,"An Arcadia woman is suing her former employer, alleging she was fired for refusing to participate in mandatory on-the-job Scientology classes. Annie R. Lees lawsuit against Pasadena-based Lusida Rubber Products Inc. and two company executives, Wayne Chin and William Johonnesson, alleges wrongful termination, religious discrimination, failure to prevent religious discrimination, harassment and retaliation. Lee is seeking unspecified damages and an injunction enjoining Lusida from requiring employees to take Scientology lessons. Chin declined to talk about the lawsuit today. Under the advice of my attorney, I have no comment at this time, Chin said. He said his lawyer will draft a response on his behalf in a few days. The suit states that Lee worked at Lusida Rubber from June through December of last year as a customer service representative. A month after Johonnesson was hired in September 2014, the company began requiring all employees to attend and engage in a mandatory, 30-minute class during work hours that was based on the teachings of L. Ron Hubbard and the Church of Scientology, the suit alleges. The courses were given three times a week at first, but then expanded to almost daily last December, the suit says. The sessions were not optional and every employee was required to take part regardless of their religious affiliation, according to Lees court papers. Lee claims she began feeling pressured and brainwashed into accepting thoughts, methodologies and religious beliefs that were not in line with her own faith. She says she complained about having to take the training courses, but was told she had no choice. Johonnesson, who the suit alleges advocated in favor of holding the Scientology sessions, told Lee she had to wear multiple hats or she would not be considered fit to work at Lusida, the suit states. The plaintiff contends Johonnesson repeatedly made negative remarks about other religions and urged her to denounce her existing religious beliefs and adopt Scientology as her new religion, of which Tom Cruise and John Travolta are noted followers. After one of the teaching sessions, Lee says she and other Lusida employees were asked why they took the classes and what they learned from them. Lee answered that she did not wish to be present in the classes or learn any of the Scientology teachings that she believed were being imposed on her, but that she was forced to be present, according to her court papers. Lee was fired last Dec. 18 after being given poor performance reviews, the suit states. Other workers who had the same complaints about the Scientology sessions were terminated later, according to the plaintiff.  Interestingly, most, if not all, employees who have replaced the terminated employees have been members of the Church of Scientology, the suit says. --City News Service",1,3,3
743,"- For the second time in two weeks, demonstrators with a Bay Area animal rights group were arrested outside a Petaluma poultry plant. Three activists, all Berkeley residents, were taken into custody by police just after 1 a.m. Monday when they stepped in front of a moving semi truck as it approached to deliver live chickens to Petaluma Poultry on Lakeville Highway, the group and Petaluma police confirmed. Bay Area Animal Save identified those arrested as Rachel Ziegler, Chai Masala Canaglia and Lewis Bernier. The trio was attempting to bear witness to the suffering and exploitation of the birds and stepped out into the road holding up large reflective signs that read, Stop – Please allow Us To Bear Witness and 5 Minutes Please, the group stated in a news release. According to the Petaluma Police Department, the demonstrators were arrested and booked into a Sonoma County jail on suspicion of two misdemeanors: obstructing traffic and disobeying a peace officer. Petaluma police Lt. Brian Miller told Patch the group has been gathering on Sunday nights outside the plant for about two months in what were initially non-permitted but peaceful demonstrations. However, after the poultry plant reached out to police and expressed concern for safety of their staff and the public, the Petaluma Police Department has been assigning officers overtime in order to have a presence at the protest site while not affecting the number of patrol officers on duty throughout the rest of the city, Miller said. We have no issue with them wanting to go and demonstrate but they have got to do it lawfully but when they are running out at the last minute in front of a tractor trailer …well, I would hate for another motorist to not see the truck and stop abruptly, Miller said. ALSO SEE: Poultry Plant Denies Activists Animal Cruelty Claims Last week, demonstrator Jonathan Frohmayer, an attorney and Berkeley resident, was arrested when he allegedly sat down in front of a delivery truck in the plants driveway and refused to move. Miller said Frohmayers arrest was after police had just left the scene after being there for four hours. It is unfortunate we are in this position that we need to be there and that there cant be a responsible, respectable demonstration, Miller said. What is disheartening is that we have tried quite a bit of engagement with the group and had a lengthy conversation with the organizer for almost two hours last Sunday. According to its news release, Bay Area Animal Save is part of the international Save network and holds vigils at Bay Area slaughterhouses to expose the cruelty and suffering endured by innocent animals exploited for food. The group strives to help the public understand that these animals killed for food are no different from the cats and dogs in our homes and that these animals feel pain and love just like humans. Bay Area Animal Save claims that in the latest incident, the truck slowed but kept driving into the three activists, forcing them to back away from it until it came to a stop. After the truck stopped, other activists stepped into the road and walked toward the truck … where the chickens, crowded into crates, instead of being visible to the outside, were obscured by metal sheeting placed on the outside walls of the crates, the group said in its news release. The group says security guards from Petaluma Poultry tried to prevent them from doing so by yelling and attempting to place themselves between the truck and the activists. The metal barricades prevented the nearly two dozen activists from witnessing the condition of the birds and honoring them before their deaths, the group says. They were prevented from even a look at the world around them or to experience the compassion offered by the activists before being killed, said demonstrator Leslie Goldberg. Alicia Santurio, the founder of Bay Area Animal Save, was in attendance at the gathering intended as a vigil for the birds. Its a disgrace that we live in a world where activists trying to give animals 5 minutes of love and compassion are the ones being arrested and charged with a crime, Santurio said. The real crime is the mass killing of sentient beings at Perdues Petaluma Poultry. I want to live in a world where the animal abusers are punished not the peaceful protesters.

744,"- A Berkeley resident was arrested early Monday on suspicion of trespassing after he allegedly refused to move from his position in front of a Petaluma Poultry truck at the business on 2700 Lakeville Highway, Petaluma police said. Jonathan Frohmayer, 32, of Berkeley, was among a group of 20 demostrators who had surrounded a large tractor trailer truck, not permitting the truck to move, according to a Petaluma police statement. Over the past few months numerous demonstrators have been contacted at Petaluma Poultry, police said. The demonstrators repeatedly have been attempting to impede the traffic of Petaluma Poultry vehicles entering their facility despite numerous advisements from Petaluma Police. The animal rights demonstrations have frequently been taking place at nighttime. At 12:20 a.m. Monday, officers responded to find the demonstrators allegedly blocking the truck from moving, creating a traffic hazard that was unsafe for the demonstrators in the roadway, the driver of the truck, and other motorists on the roadway, police said. Officers ordered the group to get out of the roadway. Although the demonstrators initially did not respond to the officers commands, all but one eventually complied, police said. The one demonstrator, later identified as Frohmayer, was allegedly sitting in front of the truck on the private driveway to Petaluma Poultry, and security staff on scene requested that he be placed under citizens arrest for trespassing, police said. Frohmayer was compliant with officers but refused to get out of the roadway, police said, and was taken into custody without incident. Frohmayer was transported to Sonoma County Jail where he was booked on suspicion of one count of trespassing. The Petaluma Police Department said it encourages and supports those who choose to exercise their constitutional right to free speech, however, it requests those who choose to do so be respectful of everyone in our community and obey all laws. According to a news release from Direct Action Network, Frohnmayer, an attorney and organizer with the grassroots animal rights network, was arrested for peacefully sitting in front of a transport truck outside of the slaughterhouse gates. Frohnmayer, a graduate of Stanford and the University of Oregon Law School, was participating in a vigil organized by Bay Area Animal Save when a truck holding thousands of chickens drove into a throng of activists, the group stated. The truck pushed right into us, activist Rachel Ziegler said. The security guards said they were going to run us over. According to Direct Action Network, or DxE, the activists were holding signs saying, No hate for truckers. Just love for animals, when the incident occurred. Security guards shouted at the demonstrators as the truck approached the facility, the group said. When the truck pushed into the activists, Frohnmayer sat down on the sidewalk in front of the entrance to the facility, refusing to leave unless the birds were spared. Vigil participants say Frohnmayer was moved by his concern over animal cruelty. A lot of the birds were struggling to breathe, said activist Leslie Goldberg. They could barely move at all. It was heartbreaking to see them in so much pain. The activists say the chickens are denied any protections in transport under the 28 Hour Law and endure horrific suffering on transport trucks. They cite recent DxE exposés inside of slaughterhouses as demonstrating the inherent cruelty of using animals for food. The activists say the police, instead of arresting Frohnmayer, should have charged Petaluma Poultry, which falsely markets itself as a happy place to roost, with animal cruelty.

745,"Richmond Mayor Tom Butt released a statement Saturday saying he is saddened and distressed as details emerge in an allegedly racially motivated fatal shooting against a Richmond resident earlier this month in El Sobrante. The victims cousin expressed her familys pain at the loss of 28-year-old William Sims, saying on a memorial page, His life was taken by three individuals who targeted and murdered Will for no other reason than the color of his skin. ...there are NO WORDS for this senseless killing. Around 2:10 a.m. on Nov. 12, a sheriffs sergeant was on patrol in El Sobrante and discovered Sims lying in the roadway near Appian Way and Garden Lane and suffering from a gunshot wound. Sims was pronounced dead at the scene. As we work to strengthen our city by bringing people together, we must acknowledge heinous acts of hatred, hostility and violence that occur in our community and nation as a whole, Butt said. Though Mr. Sims death occurred outside of Richmond city limits in the nearby unincorporated community of El Sobrante, his passing has left our community stunned and seeking justice for a young man who will be remembered as a talented musician and a kind-hearted member of our community, he said. I am appreciative of the response from law enforcement, which has led to the arrest of one suspect, and I hope that the remaining suspects are apprehended and brought to justice expeditiously, the mayor said. Contra Costa County sheriffs officials said on Tuesday that deputies had arrested one man and are seeking two others in connection with Sims death. Detectives believe that Sims was at the Capri Club in the 4100 block of Appian Way when some kind of altercation occurred. Sims, a musician and retail worker, had no known gang ties and no criminal history, according to the sheriffs office. Daniel Porter-Kelly, 31, was arrested last week and is facing murder and robbery charges in addition to a hate crime enhancement for the shooting. Contra Costa County prosecutors and sheriffs officials did not elaborate on the nature of the alleged hate crime, citing the ongoing investigation, but the mayors office today described the shooting as racially motivated. Deputies are still looking for two other suspects. Theyve been identified as 32-year-old Ray Simons of Hercules and 31-year-old Daniel Ortega, a resident of either Novato or Richmond, sheriffs officials said. During the investigation, sheriffs deputies arrested Ortegas mother on suspicion of interfering with the investigation. Shes been identified as Renee Brown, 54, of Novato and is being held on $500,000 bail, according to the sheriffs office. Butt added, I urge Richmond residents to maintain our citys values of respect and care for one another, especially during a time when we are experiencing a nationwide surge in hate-filled hostility and threats to public safety. Racism, bigotry, discrimination and all other forms of hatred and oppression have no place in our city. My office is committed to working with law enforcement along with local, state and federal representatives to ensure that we remain progressive in fostering an inclusive society and ensuring public safety for all, the mayor said. I offer my deepest condolences to the family and friends of William Sims and hope all who knew him can find comfort during this unimaginably difficult time, Butt said. Porter-Kelly is being held at the county jail without bail. Hes scheduled to be arraigned at the George D. Carroll Courthouse in Richmond on Monday, prosecutors said. Sims cousin launched a GoFundMe campaign, William Sims, Jr Memorial Fund, to raise funds to cover unanticipated expenses associated with his murder. Will was a gifted and talented musician, he was gentle, kind-hearted, caring and loved by his family and friends. We have a missing link in our world today, she wrote on the website, adding, This world we live is in need of love today. The only way to win over hate is by love. The memorial, as of this morning, has raised $6,120 toward its $15,000 goal. Anyone with information regarding the whereabouts of Ortega and Simons is asked to contact the Contra Costa County Sheriffs Office at (925) 646-2441. The two suspects are considered armed and dangerous and anyone who spots them should not approach them, according to the sheriffs office. --Bay City News contributed to this report/Images of Sims courtesy of GoFundMe effort",1,0,0
746,"Petalumas Interim Police Chief writes to residents regarding recent hate crimes and hurtful behavior: To Residents of Petaluma: In the past week, the Petaluma Police Department has received reports from concerned community members that a small group of individuals have not been demonstrating respectful behavior, and in some cases the behavior has been reported as a hate crime.

The Petaluma Police Department would like to remind the community that a criminal act committed in whole or in part because of the one or more of the following perceived characteristics of the victim will be investigated and prosecuted as a hate crime: Our mission is to keep the peace and maintain a safe community by delivering professional police services with innovation and excellence.

747,"A Sonoma County jury on Wednesday heard a recording of a mother and daughter using racial epithets about a sheriffs deputy they claim used excessive force during the daughters arrest last year. Michelle Lemos, 48, and Gabrielle Lemos, 19, are charged with misdemeanor resisting or obstructing Deputy Marcus Holton when he arrested the teen outside their Petaluma area home. Holton said he was investigating a possible domestic violence incident at the Liberty Street home around 11 p.m. on June 13, 2015. Gabrielles sister Karli was sitting in a truck, and Holton said when he opened the passenger door to talk with her, Gabrielle smashed against his right side where his weapon was holstered. Holton testified he then intended to arrest Gabrielle, but Michelle and another woman shielded her. At one point, Holton said, Michelle told Gabrielle to go inside the house, and Holton said he grabbed her arm to handcuff her but she resisted. Holton said he then grabbed her and took her to the ground. Holton said Michelle grabbed him by the collar and kicked him in the face and shoulder during Gabrielles arrest. Gabrielle was arrested, treated for facial injuries at Petaluma Valley Hospital and booked in the Sonoma County Jail. Michelle also was arrested for resisting arrest but was not booked. During a phone conversation between Michelle and Gabrielle around 2:45 a.m. June 14, both used racial slurs in reference to Holton, who is black. In the tape the jury heard this afternoon, Gabrielle also says she is fine, and laughs several times. I just think its funny that a grown man had to take me to the ground, the petite teen says and laughs. Defense attorneys claimed the tapes racial epithets would prejudice the jury against their clients. Theres a real danger the jury will convict her for being a bad person, Gabrielles attorney Izaak Schwaiger told the judge. Michelles attorney Jack Scott said any bias the defendants may have shown that night was related to gender, not race because they wanted a female deputy to be called to the chaotic event. About 10 male law enforcement officers responded, according to trial testimony. Deputy District Attorney Jenica Leonard argued for admitting the recording. She said during cross-examination of her witnesses, the defense violated Judge Gary Medvigys order to steer clear of introducing a racial element in the trial. Leonard said the tape shows how they (the defendants) asserted themselves from the moment Holton got out of his patrol car. Before the trial, Judge Medvigy ruled the tape would not be introduced as evidence, but he reversed his decision Wednesday afternoon. Your clients bum-rushed him (Holton) and your clients went ballistic, Medvigy said. In cross-examination, you just threw the kitchen sink at Deputy Holton. This case just reeks of racism and why they behaved so badly to Deputy Holton, Medvigy said. Medvigy also said the defendants did not want a black man to respond to the incident. That is loud and clear in the phone call. Im going to allow the tape, Medvigy said. The trial resumes Monday morning. Previous Lemos case coverage: --Bay City News/Shutterstock image",1,0,3
748,"Alameda County prosecutors say that theyve added a special circumstance allegation of lying in wait to the murder charge that a 27-year-old transient faces for the fatal stabbing of 18-year-old Nia Wilson at the MacArthur BART station last month. John Lee Cowell is accused of stabbing Wilson and her 26-year-old sister Letifah Wilson, who survived, at the MacArthur station at about 9:36 p.m. on July 22. Cowell also faces an attempted murder charge for allegedly stabbing Wilsons sister. If Cowell is convicted of murder and the special circumstance of lying in wait he would face life in prison without parole or possibly the death penalty if prosecutors pursue that option. His plea entry, scheduled for Wednesday, was postponed until Sept. 14 at the request of his attorney, Deputy Public Defender Christina Moore, who said she hasnt yet received all of the evidence in the case. Moore also objected to the filing of the special circumstance allegation, saying she hasnt seen any evidence to support the prosecutions contention that Cowell was lying in wait when he allegedly stabbed the two sisters. About 30 of Wilsons family members and friends attended Cowells brief hearing but they left the courtroom without talking to reporters. Video surveillance at the MacArthur station shows Cowell stabbing the two Wilson sisters and then running off, BART police Officer Russell Medeiros wrote in a probable cause statement that was filed when Cowell was charged. Cowell discarded a backpack and his sweatshirt at the parking structure at the station and when officers recovered it they found several items with his name and date of birth, Medeiros said. Acting on a tip from a passenger, BART police arrested Cowell at the Pleasant Hill station the night after Wilson was fatally stabbed. Cowells family said in a statement after he was arrested that hes suffered from mental illness most of his life and has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Alameda County District Attorney Nancy OMalley said after Cowell was arraigned on July 25 that her office is prosecuting Cowell as a three-strikes defendant because he has two prior felony convictions in Contra Costa County, one for second-degree robbery on Oct. 12, 2016, and one for assault with a deadly weapon on May 25, 2012. Many black community leaders have said that the District Attorneys Office should consider charging Cowell, whos white, with a hate crime for allegedly killing Wilson, who was black, but thus far prosecutors havent found evidence that would support that enhancement. — Bay City News; Image via Shutterstock",1,0,0

750,"An eighth-grade boy is being charged with making criminal threats against a school in Piedmont, police said today. The boys name is not being released because he is a juvenile. He made the threats against Piedmont Middle School at 740 Magnolia Ave. in four YouTube videos posted Dec. 4. Police became aware of the videos Thursday when officials with the Piedmont Unified School District called them. Police Capt. Chris Monahan said in one of the videos the boy pointed a pellet gun in a mirror and the image of the gun was caught on camera as he tells other students not to come to school tomorrow. The inference is dont come to school tomorrow or you might get shot, Monahan said. Some of the threats included hate speech, police said. The boy was cited and released into his parents care. He was given a notice to appear in court. Monahan said the videos have since been taken down. Police and school officials spoke with the student. They searched the students belongings and locker and no weapons were found. Police said officers also searched the students home where they found and confiscated pellet guns resembling the ones in the videos. Two guns belonging to the students parents were surrendered to police for safekeeping. Earlier this year, a 14-year-old student was arrested at Piedmont High School for having a BB bun in his backpack in the second reported gun-related case this year at a Piedmont school. — Bay City News; Image by Renee Schiavone, Patch",1,8,3

753,"Protests are expected throughout the day in Oakland and elsewhere as the Movement for Black Lives has called for a national day of action against police violence. Rallies are planned at both Oakland police headquarters and Frank H. Ogawa Plaza this afternoon, part of nationwide #FreedomNow protests expected to last throughout the day. Autonomous direct actions are likely to spring up, such as two protesters who chained themselves to the front door of the Oakland police building at 455 Seventh St. this morning. Todays actions follow a lengthy sit-in staged Wednesday afternoon when several protesters chained themselves to the Oakland Police Officers Association building around the corner from police headquarters. The protesters were allowed to stay but left voluntarily at about 3 a.m., Anti-Police Terror Project organizer Cat Brooks said today. Similar actions were staged at police union buildings in New York and Washington, D.C., on Wednesday. Protests have resurged in Oakland and throughout the country in recent weeks following the fatal shootings of Alton Sterling in Louisiana, Philando Castile in Wisconsin and Delrawn Small in New York. Recent protests over Sterling and Castiles deaths shut down Interstate Highway 880 in Oakland for hours. Oakland organizers of todays action say their demands are the recall of Mayor Libby Schaaf, to investigate and hold accountable the officers implicated in a sexual exploitation scandal, divest half the police budget and reinvest it in educational programs and to establish a civilian police commission, a proposal expected to go before voters this November but is opposed by the police officers union. We are taking action in solidarity with Movement for Black Lives organizers who are taking militant action for a future in which they can be free from state-sanctioned violence and oppression. We echo their call for #FreedomNow, Showing Up For Racial Justice organizer Sam Bickle said in a statement. Oakland resident Sarah Raridon was one of two protesters who chained themselves to the door at Oakland police headquarters at 9 a.m. today. She said she intended to remain there until they stop killing black people. Specifically as a white person, I see a lot of white people immobilized by guilt and fear, Raridon said. It will take a lot of us putting our bodies on the line to make change. She said she wasnt part of some larger organizing group beyond taking up the call to action, but that she had been seeing what was going on in the news and passion drove her to affix herself to the door of the police headquarters building with heavy chains and sit on the concrete in the hot sun today. This is the most direct way I could think of to physically stop police from murdering black people, she said. I really do feel that none of us are free until all of us are free. --Bay City News; Photo by Scott Morris, BCN",0,8,5
754,"Sobbing echoed through an often pin-drop silent auditorium as the many children of a slain Richmond police officer spoke of his traits during a memorial Friday. Those children were joined by elected officials at Richmond Memorial Auditorium in describing the spirit of Augustine Gus Vegas, a 58-year-old Vallejo man fatally shot while off-duty on Feb. 11. And several hundred people, throngs of uniformed personnel from cities across the Bay Area as well as mayors and other prominent officials, were part of the turnout for the memorial. Interim Richmond police Chief Allwyn Brown and the citys mayor, Tom Butt, were among the first to speak; both highlighted Vegass embodiment of the community policing that the city has strived to embrace. And as an officer, Brown said Vegass approach to the job could be summarized as peacemaking. Peacemaking, simply put, is a way of living and acting that emphasizes mercy and compassion, Brown said. Still, Brown said Vegas accepted the many faces of danger that police officers come to learn. But such danger is never expected to be lurking in the walls of your personal sanctuary, he said. Vegas was allegedly killed in his home at 35 Narragansett Court by 30-year-old Robert Vega, the father of Vegass 6-year-old grandson. Vega was arrested by Fairfield police the same day and charged on Wednesday with murder and the kidnapping of that boy by the Solano County District Attorneys Office. Butt said this murder robbed the city of a a dedicated public servant ... who had a commitment to the health and welfare of his entire community. Vegas was involved in a Vallejo nonprofit founded by his wife, Sandra. The organization, Foster Greatness, provides services for foster children. Along with his wife, Vegas was a deeply religious individual. His faith was cited as the reason he became a family man and made a late in life turn to the law enforcement profession. After graduating from Napa Valley Colleges Criminal Justice Training Center in 1990, Vegass son Joe recalled how his father had door after door slammed in his face. In 2001, the Richmond Police Department gave him a chance, he said. They saw in him what we saw in him. Vegas went on to serve in the departments regulatory, property crimes and homicide units. And in his full-time job of raising 10 children, he was portrayed as an ideal father. It takes a special man to have (that many) kids and make each one feel like the center of his world, Joe Vegas said. Enrico Rico Maldonado, Vegass second-oldest son, remembered how his father treated him like a champion even when he failed to make it past tryouts for football year after year. He told me that if he was making a team, Id be his No. 1 player, he said. He never neglected to tell us how proud of us he was. Other children shared anecdotes that similarly spoke to the unconditional love Vegas offered throughout his life. Vegass daughter Angel, who reportedly had a relationship with the alleged murderer, said her father died fulfilling a mission to protect and serve. He protected me, Angel said, tear-stricken and flanked by her brothers and sisters on auditoriums stage. He protected my baby. Vallejo Mayor Osby Davis, a friend of Vegass, recognized the importance of this. What better eulogy than to die as he lived -- saving and protecting his family, Davis said. --Bay City News/Image via The Richmond Police Department on Facebook",0,8,5

758,"An Islamic advocacy group is calling on authorities to step up protection for mosques after a San Jose Islamic center received a derogatory letter in the mail this week. On Thursday evening, the Evergreen Islamic Center at 2486 Ruby Ave. received a letter, which addressed the centers members as children of Satan, according to the Council on American-Islamic Relations. The letters author also called Muslims vile and filthy people and said members should pack their bags and get out of dodge, CAIR said. Additionally, the letter also said that President-elect Donald Trump is going to cleanse America and make it shine again. And, he is going to start with you Muslims. The San Jose Police Departments assault unit, which investigates hate-motivated crimes, responded to the incident and is conducting an investigation, according to police. The incident is one of many that have happened across the country since the Nov. 8 presidential election, targeting American Muslims and other minority groups, CAIR said. We urge local law enforcement authorities to work with Muslims community leaders to ensure the safety of all houses of worship, CAIR-San Francisco Bay Area Executive Director Zahra Billoo said in a statement. Our states political and religious leaders need to speak out against the mainstreaming of Islamophobia that we are witnessing in California and nationwide. Officials at the Evergreen Islamic Center reassured its followers through a post that the community was never under any direct and active threat. It is extremely important to make a note of the rapid reaction we received from the law enforcement, from our local leaders and our entire community, a director said in the message. It is heart-warming to know that there are so many good people out there including our long-term neighbors who reject hatred and have offered us unconditional support during these trying times.

759,"A Concord man who was sentenced last month to three years in state prison for a charge related to a 2014 church fire in San Francisco is now awaiting a federal trial on arson and hate-crime counts stemming from a blaze at a Pittsburg church in 2010. Hugo Scherzberg, 48, was indicted by a federal grand jury in Oakland on March 5 on charges of the arson of the Church of the Living God, Temple #21, in Pittsburg on March 20, 2010, and damaging a building because of its religious character. At the time of the federal indictment, Scherzberg was in San Francisco jail. He pleaded guilty in San Francisco Superior Court on Feb. 20 to a charge of possessing an incendiary device at the time of a fire at Pilgrim Community Church in the city on Nov. 23, 2014, according to San Francisco district attorneys office spokesman Alex Bastian. Bastian said Scherzberg was initially charged with both arson and possession of an incendiary device in connection with the 2014 fire, but San Francisco prosecutors dropped the arson charge as part of the plea deal. After a motion by Scherzberg to withdraw his guilty plea was denied, he was sentenced in Superior Court on April 17 to three years in state prison for the incendiary device possession conviction, Bastian said. On April 29, a federal magistrate ordered Scherzberg transferred to U.S. District Court to face the federal charges. Scherzberg made his first appearance in the federal case before U.S. Magistrate Kandis Westmore in Oakland on Monday and was assigned a federal public defender. He pleaded not guilty to the charges. Westmore ordered him detained in custody while awaiting trial and ordered him to return to the court of U.S. District Judge Haywood Gilliam on June 8 for a status hearing on the case. The two federal charges each carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and the arson charge has a mandatory minimum of five years, if Scherzberg is convicted. The Pittsburg church is part of the nondenominational Christian network of the Church of the Living God International Inc., based in Columbus, Ohio. The church has also rented space to the Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church. Several days after the 2010 fire, a Contra Costa County Fire Protection District spokeswoman said the blaze was a small fire set just inside a window of the church. No injuries were reported, but the fire caused an estimated $75,000 in damage to the structure and $50,000 in damage to its contents, the spokeswoman said. An insurance company later paid an unspecified amount in damage claims, according to the indictment. --Bay City News --Shutterstock image Also on Patch:",1,3,1

761,"A Pleasanton man who owns a small cabin in Calaveras County was stunned and horrified to discover that his retreat had been vandalized with anti-Semitic graffiti. Craig Mullins, the owner, believes the vandalism occurred on April 20. In addition to the extensive damage, which included cabinet doors ripped off of the hinges, the furniture, electronics and glass smashed, there was a noose and slurs sprayed on the walls. Mullins said he reported the damage to the local law enforcement agency, who believes juveniles are likely involved. The vandals caused more than $200,000 worth of damage, according to Mullins. Mullins launched a GoFundMe page to help pay for the many repairs. In this day and age its a shame to have this much hate against another race, Mullins said on his GoFundMe page. It just makes a person sick to think that this is going on. We have come so far in the last 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 years. Yet a few still live in the stone age.

762,"The Alameda County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously today to continue supporting the sheriffs offices controversial Urban Shield first-responder training exercise despite strong opposition by a large group of activists. Some of the dozens of speakers at a three-hour hearing on the law enforcement training exercise the sheriffs office has hosted every year since 2007 alleged that its racist and xenophobic and has a negative impact on communities of color and immigrants. Board members said they share some of the speakers concerns but said they will continue to back it as long as Sheriff Gregory Ahern keeps making efforts to improve it and lets them monitor it closely. Supervisor Nate Miley said, I initially was not a supporter of Urban Shield but I became a fan and a supporter over time. Miley said of Ahern, This man is not perfect but no one is perfect. We just need to weed out the toxic elements in Urban Shield. He said, I think Urban Shield is necessary. Supervisor Richard Valle said, We continue to dialogue with Urban Shield. We will move forward with funding and dig deeper into this. Scott Haggerty said, I see no reason to discontinue Urban Shield. Supervisor Keith Carson said, This is a complicated issue and will continue to be complicated on many fronts. Its crucial that the board keeps close oversight. Ahern said he has put in adequate safeguards to make sure that the annual Urban Shield training program bans racial profiling, excludes vendors who display derogatory or racist messages and excludes the sale or transfer of assault weapons and firearms. The event, which is held at the Alameda County Fairgrounds in Pleasanton each September, provides training for natural disasters as well as man-made disasters such as explosions, mass shootings and terrorism. Ahern said 30 law enforcement agencies from the Bay Area participate every year as well as two other agencies selected from other parts of the U.S. and another two agencies that are selected from foreign countries. At its meeting today, the Board of Supervisors discussed the findings of an 18-member panel of community members, health officials and educational officials that was formed last year to address the communitys concerns about the Urban Shield. Activists who oppose the training exercise made much of the task forces determination that it was in no position to accomplish its community relations goals or to make any recommendations or assessments related to the programs impact on communities. Executive Director of the Arab Resource & Organizing Center Lara Kiswani, who was appointed to the task force, said, The task force agreed that as a body it does not represent vulnerable communities or those impacted by the training program. Kiswani said, The primary reason for this is that the composition of the task force was disproportionately not representative of vulnerable communities and communities most impacted by policing in Alameda County. She said, This is what weve been saying for years. If decision-makers in Alameda County want to take disaster and emergency response seriously, as its residents do, then it has to implement programs that are inclusive, sustainable, and transparent. Tash Nguyen of the Ella Baker Center, who was also a member of the task force, alleged that, Urban Shield and its sponsors have revealed dangerous values and politics. Nguyen also charged that Urban Shield includes training scenarios that use stereotypes of Arab and Muslim people.

763,"An undocumented immigrant who became the face of a national debate over immigration fueled by candidate Donald Trump was found not guilty Thursday of murdering a woman on a San Francisco pier. The six-man, six-woman jury reached the verdict on the sixth day of deliberations following a four-week trial. Jose Inis Garcia Zarate was charged with murder, assault with a deadly weapon and being a felon in possession of a gun in the July 1, 2015 death of Kate Steinle, a 32-year-old Pleasanton native and San Francisco resident. The jury found him guilty of the gun possession charge but not guilty on all other counts. Steinle was walking on Pier 14 with her father and a family friend around 6:30 p.m. when she was struck in the back by a single bullet that had ricocheted off the pier before it hit her. Steinles death fueled a fierce debate over the treatment of immigrants without legal status — Garcia Zarate had been deported five times — and responsibilities local law enforcement should play in detaining them. Prosecutor Diana Garcia had argued the shooting was a deliberate act, while defense attorneys Matt Gonzalez and Francisco Ugarte described it as an accident, occurring after Garcia Zarate picked up a gun he found on the pier. Inside the courtroom, Garcia Zarates status as an undocumented immigrant played little role in the trial, which focused on whether he intended to pull the trigger and whether an accidental shooting was in fact possible. However, outside the courtroom the case became part of a highly politicized national debate over Sanctuary City policies after it became known that Garcia Zarate, who has prior criminal convictions for drug charges and returning to the country after deportation, had been released from city jail several months earlier without notification to federal immigration authorities. Before the shooting, Garcia Zarate had finished a federal prison sentence for illegal re-entry into the United States and was later released despite a request from federal immigration officials to detain him for deportation. San Franciscos decision to protect criminal aliens led to the preventable and heartbreaking death of Kate Steinle, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement Thursday night. I urge the leaders of the nations communities to reflect on the outcome of this case and consider carefully the harm they are doing to their citizens by refusing to cooperate with federal law enforcement officers. On Twitter, Trump wrote, A disgraceful verdict in the Kate Steinle case! No wonder the people of our Country are so angry with Illegal Immigration. San Franciscos Sanctuary City policy deliberately restricts communication and cooperation between local law enforcement and immigration authorities in an effort to encourage immigrants to report crimes and maintain communication with local police. Among those capitalizing on the case was then-candidate Donald Trump, who cited the death of beautiful Kate as justification for a crackdown on immigration. Gonzalez expressed condolences to the Steinle family for the awful tragedy they had suffered, but said the jurors decision should be respected. Should Trump or Attorney General Jeff Sessions choose to comment on the case again, he said, they should recall that they are under investigation themselves by a special prosecutor and may soon avail themselves of the presumption of innocence. I would ask them to reflect on that before they disparage the results of this case, he said. Ugarte said the case had been used to foment hate and drive a program of mass deportation. Nothing about Mr. Garcia Zarates ethnicity, nothing about his immigration status, nothing about the fact that he is born in Mexico has any relevance to what happened on July 1, 2015, Ugarte said. We believe the verdict is a correct and accurate reflection of the law and what happened, he said. Public Defender Jeff Adachi said his office had worked during the trial to not only present evidence to the jury but to the community to correct the record, given the amount of misinformation that had been put out about the case. Alex Bastian, a spokesman for the district attorneys office, said the verdict was not what prosecutors had hoped for, but that they would respect the jurors decision. This really is about the Steinle family, Bastian said. Theyve shown incredible resolve during this whole process. The Steinle family was not in the courtroom for the verdict, but attended on some other days. A local family member of Garcia Zarate attended court on some days but was not present for the verdict. Garcia Zarate, who has remained in custody since his arrest shortly after the shooting, will be sentenced to either 16 months in prison, two years or three years on the gun possession charge, depending on the ruling of Judge James Feng. A sentencing hearing has been set for Dec. 14. By Bay City News Photo courtesy of Kate Steinle GoFundMe",1,1,0

765,"The Stop Urban Shield Coalition will hold a rally in front of the Alameda County government building near Lake Merritt in Oakland at 4 p.m. today to protest the Urban Shield law enforcement disaster training event thats being hosted by the county sheriffs office this weekend. Sheriffs officials say the purpose of the conference, which is being held at the Alameda County Fairgrounds in Pleasanton, is to train law enforcement officers, firefighters and paramedics on how to respond to natural disasters as well as man-made disasters such as explosions and mass shootings. Urban Shield was launched several years after the terrorist attack on Sept. 11, 2001, which sheriffs officials said showed that law enforcement agencies werent well prepared for such attacks. More than 100 agencies and thousands of people, including some from foreign countries, have participated in past conferences. Sheriffs officials werent immediately available for comment on the details of this years conference, which began on Thursday and will continue through Monday. Members of the Stop Urban Shield Coalition allege that the conference increases the militarization of law enforcement officers. Mohamed Shekh of Critical Resistance, one of the groups that will be participating in the rally in Oakland today, said this years conference comes on the heels of President Trump announcing that he will be lifting restrictions on the transfer of military equipment to police departments. Sharif Zakout of the Arab Resource and Organizing Center said in a statement, Alameda County Sheriff Gregory Aherns Urban Shield fits neatly in line with Trumps greenlighting of military weapons going to police departments and his attack on immigrants. Zakout said, As Trump is seeking more deportations and increased police militarization federally, Ahern is doing so locally by collaborating with ICE and hosting Urban Shield. They both are waging war on communities of color. After the rally Stop Urban Shield organizers are also planning to hold a resource fair at the nearby Lake Merritt Amphitheater thats aimed at providing workshops, aid kits, and information on how communities themselves can respond to emergency situations without militarized law enforcement. In January the Alameda County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously to continue supporting the Urban Shield training exercise even though many board members said they share some of the concerns expressed by the Stop Urban Shield Coalition. Board members said they believe Sheriff Ahern has put in adequate safeguards to make sure that the training program bans racial profiling, excludes vendors who display derogatory or racist messages and excludes the sale or transfer of assault weapons and firearms. As part of its vote, the board included an amendment to form an 18-member panel of community members, health officials and educational officials that will address the communitys concerns about Urban Shield.

766,"Friends and family were mourning Friday a 16-year-old transgender Fallbrook girl who died last week in an apparent suicide. Taylor Alesana died April 2. In the months prior to her death, the Fallbrook High School sophomore posted several YouTube videos and she spoke about her transition. Alesana said in an online biography she was born in North Hollywood and lived in Poway and Escondido before moving to Fallbrook, where she began her transition and started a new school with a new name and new pronouns. In a post from October, Alesana detailed how the bullying against her started in middle school after she came out as bisexual and began wearing makeup. I feel for anyone whos just a little bit different -- they know what bullying is like, she said. She chronicled her troubles making friends at her new school, and being kicked out of various groups after they found out she was different. In a post from December, she said she was forced to go back in the closet for her own protection following being bullied online by a fellow student. She said she was suspended for retaliating. She said that hurtful words could lead to threats, which can lead to physical violence. If anyone is getting teased like I did, go to the school, go to the police and do whatever you can do to protect yourself, she said. Alesana did have many friends at the North County LGBTQ Resource Center, according to a statement from the organization, which described her as a beautiful and courageous girl looking for acceptance. But the support she received was not enough to counter the very difficult time she had at Fallbrook High School, the statement said. As a transgender teen she was constantly picked upon, bullied and attacked by her peers. With few adults to turn to, and with no support from her school, her life became too difficult. The organization hosted a memorial service for Alesana Thursday night. In a statement, Fallbrook High School said Alesana tragically passed away during the spring break. School officials said they were attempting to honor the familys request for privacy, and were helping the students and staffers affected by her death. Counseling and other services have been offered, the statement said. It is never easy when something like this happens, but we are working to move forward together and stronger than before, the statement said. --City News Service contributed to this article.

767,"SAN DIEGO, CA: A rise in theft pushed the crime rate in San Diego County up 6 percent last year, but it remains relatively low when compared with statistics compiled over the past 36 years, according to a San Diego Association of Governments report released Thursday. The report, Thirty-Six Years of Crime in the San Diego Region: 1980 Through 2015, states that the number of larcenies reported in 2015 was 11 percent higher than in the previous year. About a third of them involved an item being taken from a vehicle. The number of break-ins or other unlawful entry of a structure in San Diego County fell to a 36-year low in 2015, and about half of the 10,731 reported did not involve forced entry. Burglary was the only property crime to decrease in number from 2014 to 2015, according to SANDAG. The 84 homicides in the San Diego region in 2015 was 14 percent higher — or 10 more — than in 2014, although the violent crime rate has been on the decline since 1992. But a greater proportion of the slayings stemmed from arguments and fewer were tied to gangs, according to SANDAG. Last year, 10,938 violent crimes like homicide, robbery and aggravated assault were reported to local law enforcement agencies, which brought the rate to 3.35 per 1,000 population — 2 percent higher than in 2014. The overall crime rate in San Diego County in 2015 was 6 percent higher than a 36-year low in 2014, according to the annual crime report. About 85 percent of the 74,383 crimes reported to local law enforcement agencies last year were property crimes. Despite this years uptick, the crime rate was still the second lowest since 1980, SANDAG Criminal Justice Research Director Cynthia Burke said. And the region still has one of lowest crime rates in the nation. Researchers also found the number of domestic violence incidents across the region had increased 6 percent, violent crimes against seniors were up 10 percent and auto theft was up 5 percent. However, hate crimes had decreased by 12 percent and arson was down 13 percent. City News Service Photo: Shutterstock",0,8,5
768,"In the wake of a federal finding that police in Ferguson, Missouri, engaged in a pattern of racial bias, a San Diego police lieutenant said Thursday that the department employs ongoing strategies to fight actual and perceived bias in its law enforcement practices -- an effort that is never at an end state. We dont believe that theres an urgent problem (here), SDPD public- affairs Lt. Scott Wahl told City News Service. Its just that (avoiding bias) is an ongoing part of our culture that were always ... keeping in the forefront. Wahl made his comments following the U.S. Department of Justices conclusion this week that the Ferguson Police Department in Missouri has engaged in a widespread pattern of racial bias and constitutional violations, but that the fatal shooting of a black man there by a white officer though a tragedy did not involve prosecutable conduct. The San Diego Police Department is not completely free of race-related problems, as evidenced by a report SDPD Chief Shelley Zimmerman made last month to the citys Public Safety and Livable Neighborhoods Committee on data from traffic stops. According to cards filled out in 2014 by officers about their stops, black motorists accounted for 11 percent of vehicle stops and 23 percent of searches, despite comprising only 5.5 percent of San Diegos population, Zimmerman told the panel. Hispanic drivers made up 30 percent of the stops and 40 percent of the searches, while comprising 27 percent of the population. The comparable rates for whites and Asians were below their population shares. The data showed that the problem exists, according to Mark Jones, a black ex-Marine and leader of the Black Students Justice Coalition. Jones has pushed for changes in SDPD practices in the wake of fatal police shootings of unarmed black men such as the one in Ferguson. The police have to change their culture from within and enforce existing policies, Jones told the council committee. Police officials say officers collected the data early in the last decade but the practice diminished over time. The SDPD resumed the practice late in 2013. Those findings demonstrate the need for police agencies to constantly monitor their dealings with minority groups and other subsets of the communities they serve, according to Wahl. Everybody has bias, and we provide training to our personnel that helps them understand bias and what our personal biases are, and make sure they do not become a part of how we police, he said. Additionally, SDPD personnel attend an average of about 140 community hearings a month, sitting in on meetings of planning groups, town councils, neighborhood-watch organizations and religious congregations, Wahl said. Officers attending such sessions are directed to be receptive to any complaints about racially motivated police misconduct. Also, the department actively searches out such problems in its ranks through the SDPD Professional Standards Unit, according to Wahl. The need to identify and eliminate bias in the department is not a duty that will simply go away, the lieutenant said.  Its never at an end state, he said. Its always something that were addressing and were keeping an eye on. --By City News Service Subscribe via email to Patch Alerts and our Daily Newsletter, and stay in touch with your community and the Patch California regional network.

770,"The following is a collection of weekly police, court and fire stories from around the Redondo Beach area this week. The victim was pushed to the ground by one of the suspects at a South Bay Starbucks. The 18-year-old is accused of driving the getaway car in a fatal South Los Angeles shooting.F The man was holding an Airsoft or pellet gun that was very realistic-looking, Sheriffs Lt. Rodney Moore told reporters. Police responding to a report of a gunman in Redondo Beach shot and killed the suspect, who turned out to be armed with a pellet gun. One suspect is outstanding after the early morning search near Marine Avenue and Walnut Avenue. Police say the suspect was captured on video surveillance using credit cards stolen from the vehicle burglaries. The woman was in a car when she was shot, according to reports from the scene. The 52-year-old man left a suicide note before departing from his home last week. She was found about 9 p.m. Tuesday, according to Long Beach police. The driver was heading southbound on Studebaker Road when his vehicle hit a center median and a light pole. The pedestrian was struck at about 9:40 p.m. Friday in the 1400 block of Pacific Avenue. The crash shut down Pacific Coast Highway in both directions between Lewis and Alamitos streets, police said. Relatives of the victim are calling the incident a hate crime.

771,"By A.C. Thompson, ProPublica, Ali Winston and Darwin BondGraham for ProPublica It was about 10 a.m. on Aug. 12 when the melee erupted just north of Emancipation Park in Charlottesville, Virginia. About two dozen white supremacists — many equipped with helmets and wooden shields — were battling with a handful of counter-protesters, most of them African American. One white man dove into the violence with particular zeal. Using his fists and feet, the man attacked one person after another. The street fighter was in Virginia on that August morning for the Unite the Right rally, the largest public gathering of white supremacists in a generation, a chaotic and bloody event that would culminate, a few hours later, in the killing of 32-year-old Heather Heyer, who was there to protest the racist rally. The violence in Charlottesville became national news. President Donald Trumps response to it — he asserted there were some very fine people on both sides of the events that day — set off a wave of condemnations, from his allies as well as his critics. But for many Americans, conservatives as well as liberals, there was shock and confusion at the sight of bands of white men bearing torches, chanting racist slogans and embracing the heroes of the Confederacy: Who were they? What are their numbers and aims? There is, of course, no single answer. Some who were there that weekend in Charlottesville are hardened racists involved with long-running organizations like the League of the South. Many are fresh converts to white supremacist organizing, young people attracted to nativist and anti-Muslim ideas circulated on social media by leaders of the so-called alt-right, the newest branch of the white power movement. Some are paranoid characters thrilled to traffic in the symbols and coded language of vast global conspiracy theories. Others are sophisticated provocateurs who see the current political moment as a chance to push a white agenda, with angry positions on immigration, diversity and economic isolationism. ProPublica spent weeks examining one distinctive group at the center of the violence in Charlottesville: an organization called the Rise Above Movement, one of whose members was the white man dispensing beatings near Emancipation Park Aug. 12. The group, based in Southern California, claims more than 50 members and a singular purpose: physically attacking its ideological foes. RAMs members spend weekends training in boxing and other martial arts, and they have boasted publicly of their violence during protests in Huntington Beach, San Bernardino and Berkeley. Many of the altercations have been captured on video, and its members are not hard to spot. Indeed, ProPublica has identified the groups core members and interviewed one of its leaders at length. The man in the Charlottesville attacks — filmed by a documentary crew working with ProPublica — is 24-year-old Ben Daley, who runs a Southern California tree-trimming business. Many of the organizations core members, including Daley, have serious criminal histories, according to interviews and a review of court records. Before joining RAM, several members spent time in jail or state prison on serious felony charges including assault, robbery, and gun and knife offenses. Daley did seven days in jail for carrying a concealed snub-nosed revolver. Another RAM member served a prison term for stabbing a Latino man five times in a 2009 gang assault. Fundamentally, RAM operates like an alt-right street-fighting club, said Oren Segal, director of the Anti-Defamation Leagues Center on Extremism. Despite their prior records, and open boasting of current violence, RAM has seemingly drawn little notice from law enforcement. Four episodes of violence documented by ProPublica resulted in only a single arrest — and in that case prosecutors declined to go forward. Law enforcement officials in the four cities — Charlottesville, Huntington Beach, San Bernardino and Berkeley — either would not comment about RAM or said they had too little evidence or too few resources to seriously investigate the groups members. In Virginia, two months after the deadly events in Charlottesville, Corinne Geller, a spokeswoman for the Virginia State Police, would not say if the police had identified RAM as a dangerous group. Were not going to be releasing the names of the groups that we believe were present that day in Charlottesville, she said. Investigators, she added, are still reviewing footage from the event. Law enforcement has a mixed record when it comes to anticipating and confronting the challenge of white supremacist violence. Often working undercover at great personal risk, federal investigators have successfully disrupted dozens of racist terror attacks. In the last year, agents have captured three Kansas men planning to bomb a mosque and an apartment complex inhabited largely by Somali immigrants, arrested a white supremacist in South Carolina as he plotted a big scale attack, and investigated a neo-Nazi cell that allegedly intended to blow up a nuclear power plant. But there have also been failures. During the past five years, white supremacists, some of them members of gangs or organized political groups, have murdered at least 22 people, according to the Global Terrorism Database and news reports. And some government insiders say the intelligence services and federal law enforcement agencies have largely shifted their attention away from far-right threats in the years since 9/11, choosing instead to focus heavily on Islamic radicals, who are seen by some to pose a more immediate danger. State and local police have struggled to respond effectively to the recent resurgence in racist political organizing. Police in Sacramento were caught unprepared in June 2016 when neo-Nazis and anti-fascist counter-protesters, or antifa, armed with knives and improvised weapons, clashed outside the California State Capitol during a rally. Ten people were sent to the hospital with stab wounds. Taking a different tack, Gov. Rick Scott of Florida took the aggressive step of declaring a state of emergency in the run-up to this weeks appearance by Richard Spencer, a white supremacist scheduled to speak in Gainesville. Michael German is a former FBI agent who during his career infiltrated a Nazi skinhead gang and militia organizations. German, now a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law, said he is worried that law enforcement doesnt comprehend the threat posed by this latest iteration of the white supremacist movement. Police and federal agents, in his view, are looking at this whole thing so narrowly, as two groups clashing at a protest. In reality, German said, it is organized criminal activity. One of the first people known to have been targeted by RAM was a journalist working for OC Weekly, an irreverent liberal publication based in Orange County, California. The date was March 25, and writer Frank John Tristan was covering a Make America Great Again rally in Huntington Beach. The event, which had drawn more than 2,000 Trump supporters, marked what seems to have been RAMs public debut. About a dozen RAM fighters showed up, with members carrying an anti-Semitic sign and a massive banner emblazoned with the words Defend America. The march also drew a small contingent of anti-Trump protesters, including some militant antifa activists, and some people intent on physically blocking the procession as it moved along the Pacific Coast Highway. Before long, the scene turned violent and brawls between the political foes swept across the beach. The Trump supporters felt empowered to ridicule and intimidate me, Leopo recalled in an OC Weekly article. I kept shooting despite the insults and just as I was about to click the shutter on my camera, I looked up and locked eyes with a white woman carrying a flag. The woman struck Leopo and Feinzimer with the flagpole. A man shoved Feinzimer, sending him reeling. Tristan intervened, trying to calm the situation. Thats when two men attacked him. One was a RAM member who charged at Tristan and began punching him in the face. The other assailant, who wasnt a RAM fighter, grabbed Tristans sweatshirt and hit him with a series of punches. Tristan was staggered. Someone standing nearby fired off a thick stream of pepper spray, and Tristans beating ended. Then RAM members fanned out and began fighting with other people. Another RAM member confronted a masked counter-protester, grabbed the man, and threw him into the sand. From there he pummeled the counter-protester with his fist and elbow. Captured on video and shared through social media, the spectacle became a meme of the so-called alt-right. In the days after the mayhem, Tristan spent hours studying shaky smartphone videos and scrolling through social media posts trying to identify the men who attacked him. He concluded that a 21-year-old man named Tyler Laube was the RAM member who struck him. Laube appears with his face uncovered in several group photographs of RAM from their training sessions in an Orange County park and at the Huntington Beach rally. ProPublica was unable to contact Laube, but court records show he has had many entanglements with the law in recent years.  He has been convicted of fighting with a paramedic at a supermarket, illegally possessing a switchblade, disturbing the peace, and DUI, according to Los Angeles County court files. In 2015, Laube pleaded no contest to felony robbery charges — prosecutors said he partnered with another man to rob a 7-Eleven and another convenience store at gunpoint. While in jail before trial, Laube told a detective that hed gone to a Hollywood strip club and gotten high on Xanax — the potent, often-abused prescription benzodiazepine — before acting as the wheelman in the robberies, which occurred early in the morning in Redondo Beach, according to court transcripts. Laube, court records indicate, was on probation on the day he allegedly assaulted Tristan. In the six months since the violent rally, state parks police have opened no criminal case in connection with the assault on Tristan and made no arrests. It is unclear how much of the abundant photographic evidence and video footage the authorities have reviewed, if any. Capt. Kevin Pearsall, a regional superintendent with the parks police, says his officers cant act because theyve received no complaint from Tristan. However, former OC Weekly editor Gustavo Arellano says hes repeatedly contacted parks police via phone and email in hopes of getting them to investigate. Parks police documents and internal emails obtained by ProPublica show that Arellano has reached out to police brass and that detectives are aware of the assault on Tristan. Arellano said since the assault not a single law enforcement agency or official had contacted him about the alleged perpetrators. We know their identities, said Arellano, who supervised Tristan and the other journalists until recently, when he left the paper amid staff cuts. But what good is the truth when the law doesnt give a shit? No charges have been brought against the people who attacked Leopo and Feinzimer, either, though Pearsall says those incidents have been examined by police. According to Pearsall, his agency, which is tasked with maintaining order in Californias vast network of parks and recreational areas, doesnt have the resources to carry out extensive investigations and must turn to outside police forces for assistance in such cases. In an undated photo posted to their since-deleted Instagram account, RAM members pose in skull masks.Most of the time, the young men of the Rise Above Movement, nearly all of them in their 20s, look perfectly innocuous: close-cropped hair, clean-shaven faces, T-shirts and jeans. But for public events, RAM has developed its own menacing signature look, with members often wearing skull masks and goggles to ward off pepper spray. At times, RAM fighters have tied American flag bandannas around their faces to conceal their identities. A RAM recruiting video posted to YouTube and Vimeo highlights the organizations violent raison dêtre, cutting between choppy footage of RAM members brawling at public events and carefully shot scenes of them sharpening their boxing skills and doing push-ups during group workout sessions. There is an entire ecosystem of low-budget white supremacist media outlets — websites, blogs, forums, podcasts, YouTube channels and the like — and RAM members have been hailed as heroes on some of these platforms. They kicked the shit out of people in Berkeley. It was great, said a host on a racist podcast called Locker Room Talk. They like to go to rallies and beat up Communists. YouTube talker James Allsup saluted RAM members as the embodiment of the ideal American man. The group portrays itself as a defense force for a Western civilization under assault by Jews, Muslims and brown-skinned immigrants from south of the Rio Grande. The RAM logo features a medieval sword with a cross on the pommel — a symbol of the crusades — and an evergreen tree. On T-shirts they wear while training, the logo appears above three words, courage, identity, virtue. At rallies, members have waved red-and-white crusader flags and carried signs saying Rapefugees Not Welcome and Da Goyim Know, an anti-Semitic slogan meant to highlight a supposed conspiracy by Jews to control the globe and subjugate non-Jews. One RAM banner, which depicts knights on horseback chasing after Muslims, reads Islamists Out! A ProPublica reporter recently met at a restaurant in Orange County with a man who says hes a leader of the organization. This man, who appears frequently in the videos of RAM members fighting, would only agree to talk openly about the groups origins and intentions if we didnt reveal his name. No other RAM members or associates would speak to us. RAM, the leader said, came together organically. It started when he encountered a few other guys with similar political beliefs, including two active duty U.S. Marines, while exercising at different gyms in Southern California. They all liked Trump but didnt think his agenda went far enough. The men began hanging out. Their numbers grew. Many came from rough backgrounds — theyd been strung out on drugs or spent time behind bars — and currently labored at tough blue-collar jobs. Soon they had a name and a mission: They would physically take on the foes of the far-right. The RAM leader claims his organization isnt racist and complains he doesnt even know what the word racism means. Were proud of our identity, he said before launching into a long list of grievances. Whites, he said, are ignored by politicians, taught to be ashamed by leftist academics, and marginalized and driven from the workforce by economic globalization. Young white men, he said, are drawn to the extreme right because there is no other option for them. Theyre disenfranchised. This intense sense of victimization is widespread among figures involved in the so-called alt-right. I wouldnt say Im a fascist, the RAM leader continued, though he acknowledged that his worldview is close. He said hes trying to create a conservative counter-culture as an antidote to the complete degeneracy of contemporary American life and the left-wing ideology thats poisoning the youth. In the leaders eyes, your life should be dedicated to God and country and your people. While the RAM leader insists the group isnt racist, on social media channels, its members regularly espouse blatantly anti-Semitic and racist views. Ben Daley has used his Facebook page to bash Mark Zuckerberg and his Facebook Jew police for taking down his anti Muslim posts; to suggest that African Americans are shit and that former President Obama is a leech; and to cheer the fatal shooting of a black man. Good riddance, he wrote. The Facebook page of another member, Robert Boman, is laden with anti-Semitic graphics, including an illustration glorifying the Nazi SS and a cartoon depicting African Americans and Muslims as rabid dogs controlled by Jews. (Court and prison records show Boman served 18 months in prison for a 2013 robbery in Torrance.) The group has drawn recruits from the ranks of the Hammerskin Nation, the countrys largest Nazi skinhead gang, which has been tied to at least nine murders in four states, including a 2012 massacre at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin. At the ADL, Segal said law enforcement agencies are struggling to keep up with RAM and the scores of other extremist outfits that have emerged in recent years. Skillful use of social media and the broader internet has allowed some of these organizations to metastasize quickly into formidable operations. And whatever connection, if any, Trump has to their rise, the groups dont hesitate to invoke his presidency as validation for their belief systems. There are so many new faces, Segal said. It creates a challenge for law enforcement. Two veteran Southern California detectives who spoke to ProPublica were not familiar with RAM before our reporters brought the organization to their attention. After reviewing photos and videos of RAM in action, as well the social media pages of its members, the investigators said they were concerned by what they saw. The group, they said, seems to have ties to white supremacist gangsters known to law enforcement, a propensity for violence, and a desire to grow their numbers. The detectives spoke to ProPublica anonymously in order to freely discuss intelligence on white extremists and street gangs. Earlier this year, on April 15, about a dozen RAM members traveled from Southern California to Berkeley. The group was met there by a fan: Vincent James Foxx, a 31-year-old video blogger and livestreamer with a fondness for white supremacists and radical right-wing politics. Foxx, a father of three who runs a growing media operation called The Red Elephants, had become RAMs unofficial propagandist. After the Huntington Beach brawls, which he attended and filmed, Foxx put together a nearly 10-minute video glorifying the groups fighting abilities and uploaded it to YouTube, where it has garnered 174,000 views to date. Foxx and RAM were sure another Trump rally in one of the most liberal cities in America would provide an opportunity for violence. Two earlier political events in Berkeley had turned ugly, with crowds of left- and right-wing activists engaging in running street battles. Police seized knives, baseball bats, axe handles, nail-studded boards and other weapons during the previous clashes. Few were predicting that the April event, scheduled for Berkeleys Civic Center Park, would be peaceful. This is what RAM had been training for. For Foxxs part, he would be shadowing the group. He knew where the action would be. When leftist counter-protesters showed up to express their contempt for the president and his supporters, RAM, fighting as a pack, chased them down and attacked them — stomping, punching, kicking. Video shows Ben Daley pounding on a man who is trapped on the ground and kicking other opponents. In one incident, Daley and RAM member Robert Rundo manhandled a journalist, Shane Bauer of Mother Jones, shoving him and yelling at him Get the fuck out of here! ... Fake news! At times RAM fought alongside an ally, Nathan Damigo, a former Marine and founder of Identity Evropa, a prominent white supremacist organization; Damigo wound up punching a female antifa member in the face, an act that would become one of the enduring images of the days havoc. Foxx wasnt just documenting the violence at the rally — he was inciting it. On video Foxx posted to YouTube, he can be heard repeatedly encouraging RAM members and others to assault people. Get that fucking cuck! he screamed when a RAM member and four or five other men grabbed a counter-protester and began beating him. Charge! Foxx yelled as a mob of right-wingers went on the offensive. Reached via email, Foxx declined to be interviewed for this story. At 11:45 a.m. that morning in Berkeley, police arrested Rundo, a 27-year-old boxer who lives in the beach town of San Clemente, for assaulting an officer and resisting arrest. Oh shit … thats one of our guys, Foxx said as officers handcuffed Rundo, who was wearing a tight gray-and-black athletic shirt and a skull mask. Prosecutors would later decide not to bring charges. We reviewed it over the summer in July and declined to file charges, said Teresa Drenick, an Alameda County deputy district attorney. We determined we didnt have enough evidence to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt. Another violent incident in Rundos past was far more clear-cut. In 2009, in Queens, New York, where Rundo had grown up, he confronted two Latino men in a store. Flanked by several other men, Rundo chased his victims into the street where one of them tripped and fell to the pavement. Prosecutors charged Rundo with pouncing on the man and stabbing him in the right hand, right elbow, left arm, chest and neck, according to court records. In a sworn statement the investigating New York Police Department detective noted that the entire episode was documented by surveillance video and that Rundos comrades used some sort of club to bludgeon the stabbing victim and his friend. Rundo, who was 19 at the time, struck a plea deal, admitting his guilt in exchange for a sentence of two years in state prison on gang assault charges. He served about 20 months of his term, prison data shows.As a detective in the 109th Precinct, Francis Johnston helped to build the case against Rundo in 2009. Johnston, who is now retired, remembers Rundo as a hard character — a bit of an asshole — with a strong dislike for law enforcement. While police were eager to question Rundos accomplices, they were never able to identify them — and Rundo never gave up their names. At the Berkeley rally, RAM certainly wasnt the only violent element on the scene — antifa cadres hurled bottles and other projectiles and instigated a number of melees. But throughout the day, interviews and video show, RAM was perhaps the most effective and disciplined group as the fighting dragged on for hours. At least 11 people were injured in the violence, with seven going to local hospitals for treatment, including a stabbing victim, according to local officials. From the second we got there it was just chaos, said the RAM leader. People like to say were Nazis and stuff, but all the people weve beaten up are white college kids. German, the former FBI agent now with the Brennan Center in New York, says he was shocked by the news reports he was seeing online about Berkeley. He thought: This isnt a riot. Its basically low-level political warfare in the streets of an American city. German, who studies national security and civil liberties at the Brennan Center, said he couldnt believe law enforcement was allowing the two sides to battle it out with each other for hours with minimal intervention. The protests in Berkeley really caught my attention, he said. This should not be happening. In his view, police and federal agents should be focusing on RAM and similar organizations. This is black and white, German said. There are certainly people exercising First Amendment rights at these demonstrations. However, these people are in the middle of brawls and open about it — theyre posting images of violence and communicating their intent to commit violence. Its very different than someone exercising their right to stand on a stage and preach their ideology. In June, RAM made its way to San Bernardino for a protest by Act for America, a controversial group that urges legislators to pass bills banning Islamic sharia law in the U.S. Act for America, which says its goal is to protect and preserve American culture and to keep this nation safe, has been labeled a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, which has highlighted its ties to Billy Roper, a veteran white supremacist organizer. In San Bernardino, the RAM forces included at least two members of the Hammerskin Nation, a loosely structured but highly aggressive Nazi skinhead gang with chapters across the U.S. and in Europe.ProPublica identified the men as Hammerskin members by reviewing video footage, photos, social media channels and court files. California has the largest racist skinhead population in the U.S., predominantly based in Southern California, Joanna Mendelson, a researcher at the ADL, testified at a recent California state Senate hearing.Adherents have their own unique subculture and are dedicated to furthering Hitlerian ideology. The gangs, she noted, range from a few members to a few hundred members, and have been responsible for some of the countrys most violent hate crimes. One of the Hammerskins who has trained with RAM and appeared with them at rallies is Matthew Branstetter, a 25-year-old Huntington Beach resident. In April 2011, Branstetter and an accomplice beat a Jewish man unconscious and robbed him in an Orange County park. Branstetter was convicted of aggravated assault with a hate crime enhancement, and sent to prison for 20 months. While the San Bernardino march, which attracted about 300 people, was nominally a protest against sharia law, it quickly devolved into an opportunity for protesters to mock Muslims and deride their faith. One man carried a sign that said Islam is not an American religion. Another wore a shirt that said Muhammed was a Homo. A smaller crowd of counter-protesters also turned out to condemn what they saw as racism and Islamophobia. Police tried to keep the two groups separated, corralling them on opposite sides of a street. But that didnt stop RAM, which brought about 15 members to the event. The groups members crossed the street and began beating counter-protesters, eventually running many of them off. In a video from the scene, RAM members boast about their actions. We physically removed em, said Daley. We chased em down the block, smashed up their car, added Rundo, describing an incident in which RAM forces shattered the rear window of a car driven by counter-protesters. San Bernardino police did not respond to requests seeking comment. Rundo also said, on video, that RAM members are fans of a white supremacist slogan called the 14 Words. The slogan was authored by David Lane while he was serving a 190-year sentence in federal prison for his role in the murder of Jewish talk show host Alan Berg and a series of armored car robberies that netted more than $4 million, money that Lane and his co-conspirators planned to use to fund a race war. Lane wrote: We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children. Lanes message has been enthusiastically adopted as a call-to-arms by the current generation of right-wing radicals, many of whom believe that Americas ongoing demographic transformation is rapidly pushing whites towards extinction. The only answer, they believe, is an uprising. What happened in Charlottesville last August looked a lot like an uprising, and RAM was right in the middle of it. You will not replace us! Jews will not replace us! yelled Daley and another RAM member, Tom Gillen, as they stood before a statue of Thomas Jefferson on the campus of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. It was the night of Aug. 11. The men held torches. They were surrounded by hundreds of young white men, all of them shouting the same words. Both of the Californians were known to law enforcement in Los Angeles County. Gillen, a surfer and 23-year-old native of Torrance, had been jailed in 2014 for possessing an illegal handgun — someone had grinded off the serial number on the gun, making it untraceable. Police seized the weapon, destroyed it and barred Gillen from owning any other guns. Gillen, like other RAM members, would not speak to ProPublica. Daley had been arrested on a gun charge that same year. He was convicted of illegally carrying a concealed snub-nose .357 Magnum revolver and sentenced to seven days in jail. Police also discovered an array of bullets in his pickup truck, including .38-caliber ammunition and .223 rifle rounds, the latter used in bolt-action hunting rifles and military-style assault weapons. In a brief text message, Daley declined to comment on his arrest or his activities with RAM. He did, however, say that he had signed up for the U.S. military and would be going through basic training shortly. That night in Charlottesville, Daley and Gillen clashed violently with a handful of college students whod gathered at the Jefferson statue holding a banner denouncing racism. RAM and the white supremacists quickly prevailed, and drove the students off the campus and into the night. Charlottesville police did little to intervene as the conflict unfolded. Whooping and giving straight-arm Nazi salutes, white supremacists began to celebrate their victory. Some chanted the words blood and soil, an old Third Reich slogan. The violence would continue — and escalate dramatically — the next morning as racists from around the country gathered around a monument to Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee for the Unite the Right rally. And once again RAM members were at the heart of the fighting. Charlottesville police declined to comment about RAM. Today, according to the anonymous RAM leader interviewed by ProPublica, his organization is trying to stay away from rallies. RAMs next moves, he explained, are confidential. Oren Segal of the ADL said RAM could prove durable or fizzle out in a matter of months. Its too soon to tell. But in both their short-term menace and their uncertain long-term future, Segal said RAM is quite representative of what he called the new alt-right youth brigades. The self-described alt-right really wants to strike while the iron is hot, he said. They believe that now is the time to go from online to the real world. And frankly, the street fighting element very much fits this narrative.

772,"The 32nd season of Survivor begins Wednesday with a 90-minute episode from 8-9:30 p.m. with Nick Maiorano, a personal trainer from Redondo Beach, among the 18 contestants. Just like in the spring 2014 season, the seasons theme is Brains vs. Brawn vs. Beauty. I love the divisions, said host and executive producer Jeff Probst in a video supplied by CBS. I love that we literally have some of the smartest people that have ever played this show this season and I like that we have brawn. You look at the hot tribe and you go, Theyre hot, guys and girls. Maiorano is member of the Beauty Tribe, Gondol. I do three things better than most people, the 30-year-old said. I listen to you, Im interested in you and I accept you. I can pretend to do those things. I pretend to do them daily. Probst described Maiorano as obviously a great-looking guy. He looks like Superman. But Nick has got an edge for sure, Probst said. Hes cocky, bordering on arrogant, thinks he knows everything, 100 percent villain. He knows that. Theres no question hes not a hero. I think hes going to stir up chaos and I think hes smart enough to maybe pull it off. Maioranos fellow Gondol tribe member Anna Khait, a 26-year-old professional poker player from Brooklyn, New York, said she would play with my flirt card. Ill flirt with a female if need be. Ill do what I need to do. Other tribe members include 19-year-old Julia Sokolowski, a self- described Survivor superfan who noted that a year ago today, I was sitting in a high school classroom, raising my hand to ask to go to the bathroom and now Im out here in Cambodia, playing Survivor; Caleb Reynolds, the fourth-place finisher in the 2014 season of the CBS competition series Big Brother; and Tai Trang, a 51-year-old gardener from San Francisco who was born and raised in Vietnam. Tai is a guy that when he walked in the door, he was on the show, Probst said. Hes that energy I wish I had more of. A proud man. Gay man. Asian American man who has this great love of the world and people and thats as beautiful as it gets. Tai would be one of the greatest winners ever if he could get to the end.

773,"Laws to protect Californians from DUI offenders, help establish an earthquake early warning system, reform the California Public Utilities Commission, increase oversight of building contractors, require police to securely stow any handgun left in a car, improve tour bus safety, crack down on water-guzzling households, and more take effect on January 1. The new laws are the result of 17 bills that were introduced by Senator Jerry Hill, passed by the Legislature and signed by Governor Jerry Brown in 2016. Here are summaries of the bills that led to the new laws and what they do: Senate Bill 24 – JPA Pension Fix for San Mateo County Resolves a pension problem that prevented the cities of San Mateo, Belmont and Foster City from completing their Joint Powers Agreement for shared fire service.

San Mateo County Firefighters and the California Professional Firefighters supported SB 24, along with the cities of San Mateo, Belmont and Foster City. SB 62 – California Public Utilities Commission Office of the Safety Advocate Establishes the Office of the Safety Advocate within the California Public Utilities Commission to advocate for continuous, cost-effective improvement of safety management and safety performance of public utilities. SB 438 – Earthquake Early Warning Implementation Complements the $10 million included in the 2016-2017 budget for the statewide earthquake early warning system by establishing the Earthquake Early Warning Advisory Board within the Governors Office of Emergency Services. The new law brings California closer to statewide implementation of the earthquake early warning system. In emergencies, the alerts sent by the warning system will help prevent devastating and life-threatening missteps. Governor Browns announcement of his signing the bill is here and view video of the press conference held at the Office of Emergency Services headquarters here. SB 465 – Building Construction Contractors: Discipline, Reporting and Building Standards SB 465 is aimed at increasing oversight of contractors by closing the gaps in information that were revealed by the collapse of a balcony at a Berkeley apartment building on June 16, 2015. Ashley Donohoe, 22, of Rohnert Park, her cousin, Olivia Burke, 21, of Ireland, and four of their friends were killed. Seven other students from Ireland, including Aoife Beary who had been celebrating her 21st birthday, were hospitalized for weeks after the balcony gave way and sent them plummeting five stories to the ground. Aoife Beary, her mother Angela, Ashley Donohoes mother, Jackie, and representatives of the Irish Consulate testified to policy committees in the Capitol about the devastating loss felt by families from California to Ireland – and urged legislators to support SB 465, which was co-authored by Senator Loni Hancock, D-Oakland. The new law: SB 512 – Governance, Accountability and Transparency at the California Public Utilities Commission SB 512 reforms the governance structure of the California Public Utilities Commission by more clearly outlining the roles and responsibilities of commissioners and staff, and by requiring the CPUC to reach out to communities affected by CPUC decisions, instead of only to regulated utilities. To do so, SB 512 makes the following statutory changes: It 1) requires the commission to annually approve performance criteria for the commission and the executive director, and to annually evaluate the performance of the executive director based on those criteria; 2) requires the CPUC to reach out to those affected by its proceedings; 3) requires CPUC judges to adhere to ethics provisions of the Administrative Procedures Act; 4) allows the public to receive hearing transcripts at no charge; 5) permits the CPUC to meet in locations other than San Francisco; 6) requires the CPUC to modify its annual report to clarify how long the CPUC takes to finish rate or penalty cases; and 7) allows local governments to receive intervenor compensation when participating in CPUC efforts to improve safety, enabling local governments that have suffered catastrophes to seek such compensation. SB 661 – The Dig Safe Act of 2016 SB 661 addresses safety problems involving excavations and gas pipelines that are beneath soil or are otherwise underground by making clarifications to the so-called one-call law (Call 811 before you dig) and by creating the Safe Excavation Board, an appointed board of excavation stakeholders that is funded by fees on utilities. The board is to 1) investigate accidents and other one-call violations; 2) develop standards for safe excavation; and 3) coordinate education and outreach efforts. SB 812 – Improving Tour Bus Safety Improves the safety and oversight of tour buses operating in California by strengthening the California Highway Patrols tour bus inspection program. The law was prompted by a tour bus accident in San Franciscos Union Square in November 2015 that injured 20 people, at least five critically. After the crash, the CHP determined that the bus had never been inspected and was not registered with the California Public Utilities Commission, as is required by law. The CHP later conducted a surprise inspection of the companys bus fleet and found over 60 violations, 29 for mechanical problems. SB 814 – Cracking Down on Water-Guzzling Households During a Drought A winner of Senator Hills 2016 Oughta Be a Law…Or Not bill idea contest for constituents, SB 814 pulls the plug on excessive water use by households that flout mandatory reductions during drought emergencies. The law requires urban retail water suppliers to set rules for identifying and cracking down on households that consume enormous amounts of water despite restrictions imposed during a statewide declaration of a drought. The new law ensures that every urban retail water supplier has a tool to curb excessive water use by customers. Households that guzzle water – while neighbors and most other Californians abide by mandatory reductions – will no longer be able to hide and persist in their excess. SB 869 – Safe Storage of Police Handguns in Vehicles Another winner of Senator Hills 2016 Oughta Be a Law… contest, SB 869 responds to numerous thefts of handguns that law enforcement officers had left in cars. The stolen firearms included guns used in two murders in the Bay Area. SB 869 closes a legal loophole that had exempted law enforcement officers as well as concealed weapons permit holders from requirements to securely stow handguns in a lockbox out of plain view, or in the trunk, if the weapons are left in an unattended vehicle. SB 996 – Affordable Housing Property Tax Cap Aids local nonprofit and religious organizations that provide affordable housing by increasing the assessed property value exemption from $2,000,000 annually to $10,000,000 annually. The new law applies to three local nonprofits, such as the Saint Francis Center in Redwood City and the Ministry Services of the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul based in Los Altos Hills, which provides housing, food and clothing services to low-income families. SB 996 provides property tax relief to such organizations so that they can continue to provide more affordable housing for low income people and families. SB 1004 – Young Adult Offender Pilot Program Hailed by Governor Brown for its innovation, SB 1004 authorizes a pilot program in five counties, including Santa Clara, to give nonviolent young adult offenders between the ages of 18 and 21 the opportunity to take advantage of supportive and educational services in the juvenile justice system, rather than serve their time in an adult county jail. Although legally considered adults, these young offenders are still undergoing significant brain development, and may be better served by the juvenile justice system with age-appropriate, intensive services. Research shows that people do not develop adult-caliber, decision-making skills until their early 20s. Psychologists note that this maturity gap makes young adults more likely to engage in risk-seeking behavior. SB 1028 – Utility Wildfire Mitigation Plans SB 1028 requires 1) utilities regulated by the California Public Utilities Commission to file wildfire mitigation plans, 2) the CPUC to review those plans, and 3) publicly-owned utilities to also file wildfire mitigation plans with their governing boards. SB 1039 – Business and Professions Omnibus Bill SB 1039 makes several changes to the statutes governing various boards and bureaus under the Department of Consumer Affairs; includes specified fee increases for several boards including the Dental Hygiene Committee of California, the California Board of Optometry, the Board of Registered Nursing, the Board of Pharmacy, and the Contractors State License Board; and eliminates the Telephone Medical Advice Services Bureau. SB 1039 specifies that the continuing education standards established for nurses by the Board of Registered Nursing shall recognize specialized areas of practice, as previously required, and require that content be relevant to the practice of nursing, be related to the scientific knowledge or technical skills required for the practice of nursing, or be related to direct or indirect patient or client care. The legislation requires the nursing board to audit continuing education providers at least once every five years to ensure adherence to regulatory requirements. The new law also requires the board to withhold or rescind approval from any provider that is in violation of the regulatory requirements. SB 1046 – Ignition Interlock Devices for Drunk Driving Offenders Extends a pilot program requiring drunk driving offenders in Alameda, Los Angeles, Sacramento and Tulare counties to install the devices known as IIDs. IIDs are calibrated to the driver and prevent a car from starting if the driver is not sober. The four-county pilot would run until January 1, 2019, when the program would be expanded statewide with minor modifications so that: SB 1046 also creates an early incentive program, providing DUI offenders with full driving privileges soon after arrest if they install an IID. Their ultimate IID time requirement would be reduced based on when the early installation occurred. Low income offenders would be eligible for assistance to pay for an IID based on a sliding scale pegged to household income. SB 1192 – Private Post-Secondary Education SB 1192 changes the California Private Post-Secondary Education Act of 2009 to improve the effectiveness of the Bureau for Private Post-Secondary Education and opportunities for student success, and extends the BPPEs operations for four years. SB 1193 – Healing Arts, Board of Pharmacy, Veterinary Medical Board Sunset Bill SB 1193 makes changes to the Pharmacy Law, Veterinary Practice Act and Psychology Licensing Law to strengthen the laws and improve oversight of licensees by these boards. SB 1196 – Professions and Vocations: Bureau of Real Estate, Bureau of Real Estate Appraisers, and Bureau of Security and Investigative Services Bill SB 1196 ensures that the Bureau of Security and Investigative Services is subject to review by the appropriate policy committees of the Legislature. The legislation changes provisions in the Alarm Company Act, the Locksmith Act, the Private Investigator Act, the Private Security Services Act, Proprietary Security Services Act, and Collateral Recovery Act to improve the oversight, enforcement and regulation of licensees by the bureau. The bill also adds a sunset review date for the Bureau of Real Estate and the Bureau of Real Estate Appraisers, and changes existing laws to improve oversight, enforcement and regulation by the CalBRE and BREA. SB 1196 includes several consumer protection and public safety reforms to operations and oversight by the Bureau of Security and Investigative Services, which licenses about 380,000 companies and employees that provide alarm services, locksmith services, private investigation, private security, repossession services and firearm and baton training. The changes are intended to ensure that an applicant for licensure as an armed security guard is capable of exercising appropriate judgment, restraint and self-control; that armed security guards are qualified for their jobs, and that California regulators step up their policing of the industry. SB 1196 also imposes stricter training standards and requirements to ensure that shootings and incidents of suspected excessive force are investigated. In addition, the new law enables gun permits to be revoked when warranted and improves oversight of companies. – SUBMITTED FOR PUBLICATION BY: Office of State Senator Jerry Hill / Image via Shutterstock",0,8,5
774,"A Millbrae man pleaded no contest last week in San Mateo County Superior Court to committing a hate crime in which he called another man a derogatory name before hitting him near a Redwood City gas station the day after the U.S. presidential election, prosecutors said this week. Around 11 p.m. on Nov. 9, Michael Goggins, 34, showed up to the Chevron gas station at 2215 El Camino Real, according to the district attorneys office. Goggins then yelled at an employee Why are you in my country? and accused him of being lazy, prosecutors said. When the employee called police, responding officers found Goggins at a nearby warehouse on Laurel Street. Goggins ignored multiple commands from officers and allegedly tried to bite officers as they were arresting him. After he was arrested, Goggins talked about hitting a Mexican and said aliens were invading the country, according to prosecutors. Officers took Goggins to a hospital, where he was given a psychological evaluation. Following his arrest, police were able to locate another victim. The victim said Goggins had approached him and his friend that day as they were walking on Willow Street. Goggins allegedly said to the victim in Spanish, Im white, Im from here. Where are you from, wetback? He then punched the victim in the chest, prosecutors said. On Wednesday, Goggins pleaded no contest to making felony threats to a police officer and a misdemeanor hate crime for violating a victims civil rights. The no contest plea comes with the condition that he wont serve no more than 120 days in county jail and will be referred for consideration into a mental health program, according to prosecutors. Goggins will appear next in court on Friday for sentencing. He remains in custody on $50,000 bail, prosecutors said. Goggins defense attorney was not immediately available for comment. The hate crime case is one of many reported nationwide following the election of Donald Trump as president. During the campaign, Trump called for a wall to be built between the U.S. and Mexico and threatened to deport millions of undocumented immigrants. ALSO SEE: --Bay City News/Shutterstock image",1,0,0
775,"- Oakland police and the FBI today asked for the publics help in finding the suspect or suspects in the fatal shooting of a 27-year-old man with a disability at a bus stop near the Oakland-Berkeley border in February. FBI Assistant Special Agent in Charge Bertram Fairries said at a news conference at Oakland police headquarters that Patrick Scott Jr. was an innocent victim who was shot while waiting in the 6200 block of Market Street at about 10:50 a.m. on Feb. 3 for a bus to his grandmothers home. Scotts mother Carol Jones drove him to a nearby hospital but he was pronounced dead there a short time later. There was no reason for this killing, Fairries said. Joining Fairries at the news conference, Oakland police homicide investigator Michael Jaeger said Scott didnt do anything to deserve what happened. Jaeger said Scott was a reserved person who stayed home a lot. However, Jaeger said police believe Scott was the intended target of the shooting based on evidence that was recovered at the scene. Jaeger said police arent releasing a description of the suspect or suspects at this time. Fairries said the FBI and Oakland Crime Stoppers are offering a reward totaling $30,000 for information leading to an arrest in the case. Jones, who said she suffers from sleepless nights, said Scott was born with a disability but declined to elaborate. Jones said her son was a good boy who was never in trouble and was living his life at the time he was shot. She said shes worked tirelessly to find the people responsible for Scotts death and has distributed about 1,500 fliers about the case so far in her neighborhood and at local churches. Asked by reporters what she would like to say to the suspect in the case, Jones said, I know what you did was wrong but if you have a guilty conscience its best to turn yourself in. Jones said, I dont hate you. No one is perfect and I forgive you for what you did to my child. She said, Do the right thing and turn yourself in. Authorities said people who have information about the case should call the Oakland police homicide unit at (510) 238-3821 or the FBIs San Francisco division at (510) 553-7400. --Bay City News/Photo via Shutterstock",1,7,0

778,"Body camera footage from the Oakland Police Department shows that officers consistently treat black residents with less respect than they show to white residents, according to a new study from Stanford researchers published in the Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences. The study controlled for the officers race, the type of the infraction or crime in question, the location of the encounter and the outcome of the interaction. Even when taking these factors into account, an individuals race remained the strongest factor in determining the amount of respect he or she received. Our findings highlight that, on the whole, police interactions with black community members are more fraught than their interactions with white community members, said Jennifer Eberhardt, a co-author of the study and professor of psychology at Stanford. To be clear: There was no swearing, said Dan Jurafsk, a professor of linguistics and of computer science who also worked on the study. These were well-behaved officers. But the many small differences in how they spoke with community members added up to pervasive racial disparities. The differences in treatment were relatively simple. White residents were more likely to receive an apology or a thank you when talking to police, while black people were much more likely to hear more subtle signs of disrespect, such as being call dude or bro or being told to keep their hands on the steering wheel. This was the first systematic study of body camera footage of its kind, the researchers said. Read the full study here. Relations between the police and black communities the took hold of the nations attention in 2015, after Michael Brown was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, and nights of protests led to conflicts between the residents and local law enforcement. A subsequent investigation by the Justice Department found large disparities in the treatment of black civilians compared to white. This included explicitly racist emails between officials, the use of law enforcement measures as fundraising efforts, and systematically targeting black residents for increased scrutiny and maltreatment.

779,"Two Oakland police officers who allegedly exchanged inappropriate racial and homophobic text messages face suspension for violating city and department policy, city spokeswoman Karen Boyd said today. However, the suspensions are subject to due process and grievance procedures, Boyd said. In addition, all Police Department employees will undergo refresher training about the citys anti-discrimination, non-harassment policy and complaint procedures because several officers involved in the case appeared to be unclear about their obligations to report the misconduct, according to Boyd. The citys policy prohibits any form of unlawful employment discrimination, harassment or other inappropriate conduct based on race, color, religion, sexual orientation or any other group protected by federal, state or local law that creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment. Boyd didnt name the two officers who face suspension. She said, In keeping with our commitment to transparency and accountability to the public, the city of Oakland is providing as much information regarding the outcome of this investigation as we are allowed to share by law. But Boyd said the city is constrained from releasing additional details because it is a confidential personnel matter that prohibits the disclosure of peace officers names. — Bay City News",1,0,3
780,"SEBASTOPOL - Three war veterans came to the aid of a woman who was assaulted at a Sebastopol cemetery on Memorial Day morning, police said. Police Officer Joseph Furry responded around 9:30 a.m. Monday to an assault by a woman on another woman at Sebastopol Memorial Lawn at 7951 Bodega Ave. The victim was on the ground and being attended to by three members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 3919 when he arrived, Furry said. Witnesses and the 60-year-old victim said the suspect, later identified as Holly Mae Lewis, 36, of Santa Rosa, was angry because she could not find a relatives gravesite. Lewis made racial comments regarding the victims speech and started slapping, kicking and punching her, Furry said. The veterans, ages 68 through 83, were preparing for a Memorial Day ceremony nearby and came to the victims aid. One of the veterans tackled Lewis and another, a retired Sebastopol police lieutenant, struggled to stop Lewis from pulling the victims hair, Furry said. Lewis fled in a blue minivan but witnesses were able to provide a partial license plate. Sebastopol police dispatcher Tracy Peters used different combinations of the numbers and letters in the license plate and the last name on the gravesite of Lewis relative to discover the vans license plate, Furry said. Police identified Lewis as the suspect and contacted her at her Santa Rosa home. She was arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon other than a firearm and committing a hate crime. Lewis posted $30,000 bail and was released from the Sonoma County Jail. The victim was treated at the scene and didnt require transport to a hospital, Furry said. -Bay City News, image via Selena N.

782,"Two men were reportedly asked to leave the Roseville Galleria on Saturday because they were kissing in the mall, according to Fox 40. 21-year-old Daniel Chesmore and his boyfriend Jose Guzman, 24, recorded audio of the guard who asked them to leave, according to Fox 40. He said, If you continue to kiss, you will be asked to leave the mall. Period ... I counted you guys kissing 25 times. I told you before, we contact any couple... A Galleria representative told the news station that, Persons that violate the Code of Conduct are asked to leave the property, but Fox 40 reports that diplays of affection are not mentioned in the Gallerias code of conduct. Facebook users swarmed to the Roseville Gallerias Facebook page after the incident. These were all posted in the span of one hour Monday night. Kelly Garland: I find the actions of your company reprehensible. I have family and friend of the LGBT community who are wonderful, cash spending, contributors to a sane society. To kick out two men who kissed on the cheek is ridiculous. I would rather see that then some over hormoned teens making out. I will NEVER shop at your mall EVER. Shame on your code of conduct. Meg Woods: Your security guard was COMPLETELY out of line for discriminating against Daniel Chesmore and Jose Guzman. General Manager Eddie Ollmann needs to be canned for this. Brushing off the press, making excuses for his employees discrimination, and lying about mall policy, how despicable can you be? ... He should have issued an immediate formal apology and removed that security guard. Instead he made an asshat out of himself, and the LGBT community and supporters arent going to let this go lightly.

783,"A Portland State University student was severely beaten and left for dead along a section of train tracks in Truckee last Tuesday in what the students family is calling a hate crime. Amtrak authorities investigating the case have said there is no evidence 22-year-old Aaron Salazars injuries suggest criminal intent, but the mans family believes he was beaten into a coma and burned because he is gay. Salazar was reportedly riding an Amtrak train back to Portland from Denver, Colorado, when he stopped for what should have only been a 10-hour layover during the 31-hour trip. He reportedly told his family over the phone that he planned to explore Sacramento during the layover, but he never made it. A worker at the train station in Truckee reportedly found Salazar lying near the tracks on May 15. Salazar sustained a broken pelvis, severe burns on his thighs, multiple brain injuries, and a damaged brain stem; he hasnt opened his eyes since he was found, according to a May 22 update on the GoFundMe.com page raising money for his medical expenses. Aaron has been trying to open his eyes recently and we are very optimistic, Austin Sailas wrote on GoFundMe.com. Aaron is still healing from the burns, and has been fighting a fever but even still his progress is remarkable. Unfortunately as many know we have been fighting with the AMTRAK department for Answers and at this point we are expecting a very long, and expensive process and are ready to fight. Doctors have apparently told Salazars family that the injuries are consistent with a beating, but no one has officially confirmed thats what happened. The Amtrak investigation is ongoing, and Salazars cousin, Sonia Trujillo, reportedly believes the company has clouded priorities. What Im concerned about is, were dealing with the Amtrak police department on an Amtrak train, Trujillo told RawStory.com. I dont know if theyre trying to protect the train or if theyre trying to protect the people. Salazar reportedly text his grandmother just before the train stopped in Truckee to tell her hed made a friend with whom he planned to explore Sacramento. No other information about that individual is available. Whats more, Salazars family says no money or belongings were taken. So, while the family believes Salazar was beaten, they maintain it must have been a hate crime because he was not robbed. I believe it was something deeper because the burn marks. Why burn somebody?, Trujillo asked RawStory.com. If youre going to hurt somebody, hurt them. But why are you going to burn somebody? A GoFundMe.com account quickly raised the familys initial goal of $5,000, so they increased it to $10,000 to help the family cover expenses — since Salazars parents arent working while they wait for their son to wake up.

784,"Laws to protect Californians from DUI offenders, help establish an earthquake early warning system, reform the California Public Utilities Commission, increase oversight of building contractors, require police to securely stow any handgun left in a car, improve tour bus safety, crack down on water-guzzling households, and more take effect on January 1. The new laws are the result of 17 bills that were introduced by Senator Jerry Hill, passed by the Legislature and signed by Governor Jerry Brown in 2016. Here are summaries of the bills that led to the new laws and what they do: Senate Bill 24 – JPA Pension Fix for San Mateo County Resolves a pension problem that prevented the cities of San Mateo, Belmont and Foster City from completing their Joint Powers Agreement for shared fire service. It allows the three cities to provide the JPA employees a defined benefit plan that those employees received as classic CalPERS members from their previous employment with the cities. San Mateo County Firefighters and the California Professional Firefighters supported SB 24, along with the cities of San Mateo, Belmont and Foster City.

The new law applies to three local nonprofits, such as the Saint Francis Center in Redwood City and the Ministry Services of the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul based in Los Altos Hills, which provides housing, food and clothing services to low-income families. SB 996 provides property tax relief to such organizations so that they can continue to provide more affordable housing for low income people and families. SB 1004 – Young Adult Offender Pilot Program Hailed by Governor Brown for its innovation, SB 1004 authorizes a pilot program in five counties, including Santa Clara, to give nonviolent young adult offenders between the ages of 18 and 21 the opportunity to take advantage of supportive and educational services in the juvenile justice system, rather than serve their time in an adult county jail. Although legally considered adults, these young offenders are still undergoing significant brain development, and may be better served by the juvenile justice system with age-appropriate, intensive services. Research shows that people do not develop adult-caliber, decision-making skills until their early 20s. Psychologists note that this maturity gap makes young adults more likely to engage in risk-seeking behavior. SB 1028 – Utility Wildfire Mitigation Plans SB 1028 requires 1) utilities regulated by the California Public Utilities Commission to file wildfire mitigation plans, 2) the CPUC to review those plans, and 3) publicly-owned utilities to also file wildfire mitigation plans with their governing boards. SB 1039 – Business and Professions Omnibus Bill SB 1039 makes several changes to the statutes governing various boards and bureaus under the Department of Consumer Affairs; includes specified fee increases for several boards including the Dental Hygiene Committee of California, the California Board of Optometry, the Board of Registered Nursing, the Board of Pharmacy, and the Contractors State License Board; and eliminates the Telephone Medical Advice Services Bureau. SB 1039 specifies that the continuing education standards established for nurses by the Board of Registered Nursing shall recognize specialized areas of practice, as previously required, and require that content be relevant to the practice of nursing, be related to the scientific knowledge or technical skills required for the practice of nursing, or be related to direct or indirect patient or client care. The legislation requires the nursing board to audit continuing education providers at least once every five years to ensure adherence to regulatory requirements. The new law also requires the board to withhold or rescind approval from any provider that is in violation of the regulatory requirements. SB 1046 – Ignition Interlock Devices for Drunk Driving Offenders Extends a pilot program requiring drunk driving offenders in Alameda, Los Angeles, Sacramento and Tulare counties to install the devices known as IIDs. IIDs are calibrated to the driver and prevent a car from starting if the driver is not sober. The four-county pilot would run until January 1, 2019, when the program would be expanded statewide with minor modifications so that: SB 1046 also creates an early incentive program, providing DUI offenders with full driving privileges soon after arrest if they install an IID. Their ultimate IID time requirement would be reduced based on when the early installation occurred. Low income offenders would be eligible for assistance to pay for an IID based on a sliding scale pegged to household income. SB 1192 – Private Post-Secondary Education SB 1192 changes the California Private Post-Secondary Education Act of 2009 to improve the effectiveness of the Bureau for Private Post-Secondary Education and opportunities for student success, and extends the BPPEs operations for four years. SB 1193 – Healing Arts, Board of Pharmacy, Veterinary Medical Board Sunset Bill SB 1193 makes changes to the Pharmacy Law, Veterinary Practice Act and Psychology Licensing Law to strengthen the laws and improve oversight of licensees by these boards. SB 1196 – Professions and Vocations: Bureau of Real Estate, Bureau of Real Estate Appraisers, and Bureau of Security and Investigative Services Bill SB 1196 ensures that the Bureau of Security and Investigative Services is subject to review by the appropriate policy committees of the Legislature. The legislation changes provisions in the Alarm Company Act, the Locksmith Act, the Private Investigator Act, the Private Security Services Act, Proprietary Security Services Act, and Collateral Recovery Act to improve the oversight, enforcement and regulation of licensees by the bureau. The bill also adds a sunset review date for the Bureau of Real Estate and the Bureau of Real Estate Appraisers, and changes existing laws to improve oversight, enforcement and regulation by the CalBRE and BREA. SB 1196 includes several consumer protection and public safety reforms to operations and oversight by the Bureau of Security and Investigative Services, which licenses about 380,000 companies and employees that provide alarm services, locksmith services, private investigation, private security, repossession services and firearm and baton training. The changes are intended to ensure that an applicant for licensure as an armed security guard is capable of exercising appropriate judgment, restraint and self-control; that armed security guards are qualified for their jobs, and that California regulators step up their policing of the industry. SB 1196 also imposes stricter training standards and requirements to ensure that shootings and incidents of suspected excessive force are investigated. In addition, the new law enables gun permits to be revoked when warranted and improves oversight of companies. – SUBMITTED FOR PUBLICATION BY: Office of State Senator Jerry Hill / Image via Shutterstock",0,8,5
785,"By TIM MORAN (Patch Staff) A worldwide anti-woman, purportedly pro-rape group was planning to meet at various locations throughout the world on their International Meetup Day this Saturday, but has decided to pull the plug as public scrutiny grows. According to a statement by the groups self-proclaimed leader Roosh V, he decided to cancel the meetings because he could no longer guarantee the safety or privacy of the men who want to attend on February 6. While I cant stop men who want to continue meeting in private groups, there will be no official Return Of Kings meetups, he wrote Wednesday evening. The listing page has been scrubbed of all locations. I apologize to all the supporters who are let down by my decision. The Return of Kings and Roosh V. have published blogs advocating for the legalization of rape when off public grounds and have often tweeted about the best ways to trick women into having sex with them. An official White House petition to label them a terrorist group has garnered more than 1,000 signatures. There were 13 of the mens rights locations for Saturdays 8 p.m. meeting in California, including: As word of Saturdays meetings spread through various news organizations and on social media, many readers met the announcement with incredulity, and some with pure outrage. Roosh V is Daryush Valizadeh, the writer of a number of books advising men on the best ways to have sex with women. He has been dubbed as the webs most infamous misogynist and says he bases his beliefs on neomasculinity. In one of his most notorious posts, he writes: I thought about this problem and am sure I have the solution: make rape legal if done on private property. I propose that we make the violent taking of a woman not punishable by law when done off public grounds. An odd Q and A on the event webpage– before it was taken down Wednesday night– made it clear women werent allowed to Saturdays meetup, and neither were gay or underage men. A question regarding the possibility of crazy feminists showing up elicited a chilling response. Record them with your camera, upload the footage to Dropbox, and then send it to me at roosh@rooshv.com afterwards so we can tear them up. According to the group meetup page, once all members had congregated near the meetup the host of the gathering was going to lead them to a secret location. The code phrase for group members was said to be Do you know where I can find a pet shop?, at which time another member would say Yes, its right here. Feminist groups planned to show up at the various meetups as part of a counter-protest, according to multiple media reports. Police departments in some Return of Kings targeted cities warned women not to interfere, fearing this may be a ruse for the men to commit rape. A look at the comments below the meetup info on the Return of Kings page made it appear like Roosh indeed has a following. The infamous blogger says he will be at the Washington D.C. meetup during the time. In all, 165 meetings are planned in 43 countries. Three sections of the Return of Kings have been formed, according to the blog: one each in Chicago, D.C. and Poland.  – Patch Editor Renee Schiavone contributed to this report.",0,8,5
786,"Laws to protect Californians from DUI offenders, help establish an earthquake early warning system, reform the California Public Utilities Commission, increase oversight of building contractors, require police to securely stow any handgun left in a car, improve tour bus safety, crack down on water-guzzling households, and more take effect on January 1. The new laws are the result of 17 bills that were introduced by Senator Jerry Hill, passed by the Legislature and signed by Governor Jerry Brown in 2016. Here are summaries of the bills that led to the new laws and what they do: Senate Bill 24 – JPA Pension Fix for San Mateo County Resolves a pension problem that prevented the cities of San Mateo, Belmont and Foster City from completing their Joint Powers Agreement for shared fire service. It allows the three cities to provide the JPA employees a defined benefit plan that those employees received as classic CalPERS members from their previous employment with the cities. San Mateo County Firefighters and the California Professional Firefighters supported SB 24, along with the cities of San Mateo, Belmont and Foster City. SB 62 – California Public Utilities Commission Office of the Safety Advocate Establishes the Office of the Safety Advocate within the California Public Utilities Commission to advocate for continuous, cost-effective improvement of safety management and safety performance of public utilities. SB 438 – Earthquake Early Warning Implementation Complements the $10 million included in the 2016-2017 budget for the statewide earthquake early warning system by establishing the Earthquake Early Warning Advisory Board within the Governors Office of Emergency Services. The new law brings California closer to statewide implementation of the earthquake early warning system. In emergencies, the alerts sent by the warning system will help prevent devastating and life-threatening missteps. Governor Browns announcement of his signing the bill is here and view video of the press conference held at the Office of Emergency Services headquarters here. SB 465 – Building Construction Contractors: Discipline, Reporting and Building Standards SB 465 is aimed at increasing oversight of contractors by closing the gaps in information that were revealed by the collapse of a balcony at a Berkeley apartment building on June 16, 2015. Ashley Donohoe, 22, of Rohnert Park, her cousin, Olivia Burke, 21, of Ireland, and four of their friends were killed. Seven other students from Ireland, including Aoife Beary who had been celebrating her 21st birthday, were hospitalized for weeks after the balcony gave way and sent them plummeting five stories to the ground. Aoife Beary, her mother Angela, Ashley Donohoes mother, Jackie, and representatives of the Irish Consulate testified to policy committees in the Capitol about the devastating loss felt by families from California to Ireland – and urged legislators to support SB 465, which was co-authored by Senator Loni Hancock, D-Oakland. The new law: SB 512 – Governance, Accountability and Transparency at the California Public Utilities Commission SB 512 reforms the governance structure of the California Public Utilities Commission by more clearly outlining the roles and responsibilities of commissioners and staff, and by requiring the CPUC to reach out to communities affected by CPUC decisions, instead of only to regulated utilities. To do so, SB 512 makes the following statutory changes: It 1) requires the commission to annually approve performance criteria for the commission and the executive director, and to annually evaluate the performance of the executive director based on those criteria; 2) requires the CPUC to reach out to those affected by its proceedings; 3) requires CPUC judges to adhere to ethics provisions of the Administrative Procedures Act; 4) allows the public to receive hearing transcripts at no charge; 5) permits the CPUC to meet in locations other than San Francisco; 6) requires the CPUC to modify its annual report to clarify how long the CPUC takes to finish rate or penalty cases; and 7) allows local governments to receive intervenor compensation when participating in CPUC efforts to improve safety, enabling local governments that have suffered catastrophes to seek such compensation. SB 661 – The Dig Safe Act of 2016 SB 661 addresses safety problems involving excavations and gas pipelines that are beneath soil or are otherwise underground by making clarifications to the so-called one-call law (Call 811 before you dig) and by creating the Safe Excavation Board, an appointed board of excavation stakeholders that is funded by fees on utilities. The board is to 1) investigate accidents and other one-call violations; 2) develop standards for safe excavation; and 3) coordinate education and outreach efforts. SB 812 – Improving Tour Bus Safety Improves the safety and oversight of tour buses operating in California by strengthening the California Highway Patrols tour bus inspection program. The law was prompted by a tour bus accident in San Franciscos Union Square in November 2015 that injured 20 people, at least five critically. After the crash, the CHP determined that the bus had never been inspected and was not registered with the California Public Utilities Commission, as is required by law. The CHP later conducted a surprise inspection of the companys bus fleet and found over 60 violations, 29 for mechanical problems. SB 814 – Cracking Down on Water-Guzzling Households During a Drought A winner of Senator Hills 2016 Oughta Be a Law…Or Not bill idea contest for constituents, SB 814 pulls the plug on excessive water use by households that flout mandatory reductions during drought emergencies. The law requires urban retail water suppliers to set rules for identifying and cracking down on households that consume enormous amounts of water despite restrictions imposed during a statewide declaration of a drought. The new law ensures that every urban retail water supplier has a tool to curb excessive water use by customers. Households that guzzle water – while neighbors and most other Californians abide by mandatory reductions – will no longer be able to hide and persist in their excess. SB 869 – Safe Storage of Police Handguns in Vehicles Another winner of Senator Hills 2016 Oughta Be a Law… contest, SB 869 responds to numerous thefts of handguns that law enforcement officers had left in cars. The stolen firearms included guns used in two murders in the Bay Area. SB 869 closes a legal loophole that had exempted law enforcement officers as well as concealed weapons permit holders from requirements to securely stow handguns in a lockbox out of plain view, or in the trunk, if the weapons are left in an unattended vehicle.

787,"Photo via Shutterstock By Bay City News Service A recent increase in the number of door-to-door solicitors operating in San Carlos has prompted authorities to remind the public to ask for a physical copy of their solicitors permit, according to the San Mateo County Sheriffs Office. Individuals and businesses that wish to sell door to door are required to obtain a solicitors permit from the city of San Carlos before contacting residents, and they have to carry a physical copy of that permit with them while engaging in door-to-door sales, according to sheriffs deputies. Solicitors routinely tell residents that their company does have a permit but hasnt given them a physical copy, according to deputies. Religious groups going door to door are protected by the First Amendment, however, and are not subject to the same requirements, according to deputies.

788,"A married American couple who collectively identify as travelling_butts on Instagram were arrested in Bangkok, Thailand, for exposing their buttocks in front of the sacred Buddhist temple Wat Arun, or Temple of Dawn. Travis and Joseph Dasilva, both 38, were taken into custody by immigration police at Don Mueang International Airport as they prepared to leave the country Tuesday, according to news reports. The couple admitted to taking down their pants and exposing their buttocks for a photo, later posted on social media, and could face jail time, the reports said. In a statement, the Thai government said they wont face a normal public indecency charge, but instead will be charged with committing indecency in a place of worship, which carries a long jail term. This is a reminder that everyone should have respect for Thai religion and culture, the statement continued. Their widely shared photo in front of one of Thailands best-known landmarks caused a stir in the Buddhist-majority country, prompting a police investigation. The couples nudity at a sacred site could also cost them a fine of up to 5,000 baht, about $154, the Bangkok Post reported. The men could be charged under Thailands computer crimes law because the image was posted online, Wisit Suwam, the deputy chief of the Bangkok Yai district police station told The Associated Press. The controversial law is often used against political activists to stifle free speech online or against those accused of insulting Thailands monarchy, the AP said. It carries punishments of up to five years in prison. As they travel the world, the Dasilvas have posted multiple pictures of their exposed fannies on their Instagram account, including the one in front of Wat Arun. San Diego City Commissioner Nicole Murray-Ramirez told the San Diego Gay and Lesbian News he is talking to American authorities in Thailand about the next steps after the two men reached out to him. Though I am very disappointed in their actions, I am talking to U.S. government officials to see what assistance we can give them, Murray-Ramirez said. Visitors to Thailands temples are expected to dress modestly. For women, short skirts, and capri type pants are discouraged, but skirts that fall below the knee are permitted. Tight-fitting leggings, ripped jeans and other clothing with holes, vests or tops without sleeves, sportswear of any type, sweatshirts and sweatpants, and any top with the sleeves rolled up, even if its warm, are prohibited. Sandals and flip-flops are permitted. The mens post on Instagram didnt garner a lot of sympathy. One user called it total disrespect if u know anything about Thai Culture. Another person commented: Why would you do something like this at a holy place. it may not be holy to you but it is to others and i am by no means a religious person. However, one user pointed out theres a lot worse out there, but this makes headlines in Bangkok. Who cares about rapes, murders and other forbidden (expletive) going on there. Death to those that show their butts at a temple.  The Associated Press contributed to this report. Paula Bronstein/Getty Images News/Getty Images",0,8,5
789,"A gang member accused of fatally shooting a decorated Navy pilot and wounding his cousin in an unprovoked attack outside a comedy club at Horton Plaza in downtown San Diego must stand trial on murder and other charges, a judge ruled Tuesday. According to evidence presented at a two-day preliminary hearing, Arrow Morris was outside the club arguing with his girlfriend at about 11:45 p.m. on June 10 when the 40-year-old defendant allegedly pulled out a gun and shot James Celani twice in the head and once in the chest. The 43-year-old victim died at a hospital. His cousin was shot in the leg. A woman who was in Morris group inside the club testified that security personnel visited their table two or three times because the defendants brother kept making disparaging comments about a gay comedian on stage. The witness -- identified only as Jazmyn -- said Morris, his girlfriend, Ashley, and his brother walked out of the club after Morris accused Ashley of having romantic feelings toward Jazmyn.She said she went outside and saw Morris rip his girlfriends purse from her hands and push her to the ground. As she ran toward the couple, Jazmyn said she saw Morris pull out a gun. After turning to run away, she said she heard four to five shots ring out. In other testimony, Morris girlfriend said he took off with her car after the shooting and left her and Jazmyn stranded. Once she got home, she said she lied to police about what she had seen until finally telling them she witnessed Morris shoot the victims. She testified that Morris had a gun in her car but told her that he wasnt bringing it into the club, and said she didnt confront him about the shooting because she feared for her safety. Morris was arrested two days after the shooting. Superior Court Judge Margo Lewis Hoy ruled that enough evidence was presented to order Morris to stand trial on charges of murder, attempted murder, being a felon in possession of a firearm and trying to dissuade a witness from testifying. He faces 79 years to life in prison plus an additional eight years and four months behind bars if convicted, said Deputy District Attorney Amy Maund. She said Morris has a 2011 conviction for assault with a deadly weapon in a road rage attack in which he struck a motorist with a hammer. Morris will be back in court Dec. 11 for arraignment.

790,"- Residents of the Mission District were stunned this weekend to find that a popular mural of music legend Carlos Santana had been vandalized with white paint, according to a community artist and organizer. Artist Mel Waters and others spent much of the day Saturday trying to clean up and repair the mural on 19th and Mission Street, according to artist and community organizer Roberto Hernandez. Murals are beloved in the Mission, and it is virtually unheard of for them to be defaced, Hernandez said in an interview earlier today. In this neighborhood, murals are sacred, he said. Theyre like your mother. They are not touched. Its an unspoken rule in this barrio (that) you respect murals. The mural of Santana, who grew up in the Mission, was created by Waters over several months in 2014. Its titled Para La MiSion and was designed to both honor the communitys native son and give hope to Latinos in the neighborhood who have been adversely affected by gentrification, Hernandez said. The worst part of the vandalism, Hernandez said, was the use of white paint, which he believes was racially motivated. This is obviously a hate crime. Its not something thats the norm in our community. We went out there and immediately got it cleaned up. We wanted to make a statement were not going to be part of this hate and anger. Hernandez said he asked police at the Mission District station to review security camera footage on the block for evidence of the crime but had not heard back as of Sunday. A San Francisco police spokesman said Sunday there werent other details about the vandalism available. --Bay City News/Photo via Shutterstock",1,0,2
791,"A San Francisco police officer said today he is being targeted and retaliated against for filing a complaint last year against other officers in which he claimed racial and religious discrimination. The San Francisco Public Defenders Office announced that the officer, whos not being named, initially made the complaint because in addition to being harassed for being of Afghan descent and Muslim, he also witnessed several incidents of racism and homophobia at the hands of officers at the citys Central Station. According to an Equality Employment Opportunity complaint filed on January with the citys Department of Human Resources, the officer said that he started working for the Police Department in 2016 and in June 2017 was assigned to the Central Station in the citys North Beach neighborhood. In the complaint, the officer described several incidents of misconduct and harassment by other officers, including an instance when other on-duty officers took him to a Broadway strip club to purposefully embarrass him. He also claimed to endure repeated accusations of his family being terrorists and of him having bombs or weapons. In addition, the officer said another officer once called him a sand ni**** about four times and on another occasion, someone vandalized his locker at Central Station, writing a flag with the word ISIS on it and the words go back underneath. The officer also said in the complaint that he witnessed other officers use the word fa**** several times and on one night, an officer confessed to him that he would only pull over drivers because they were black and Hispanic and figure out a probable cause afterward. Later that night, the same officer allegedly referred to a black driver as a monkey. After filing a complaint with the departments Internal Affairs division in November, against the advice of his superiors, the officer said he was moved to the Richmond Station. However, after growing tired with the units inaction, the officer went to the citys human resources department where he filed the EEO complaint, which was made public today. The officer is alleging that details of his initial complaint with the Internal Affairs unit were not kept confidential and led to him being retaliated against. Since making my complaint, I have been labeled a rat, singled out by my colleagues, and I now fear for my safety, the officer said. Last week, it was brought to my attention that IA shared confidential information about me and their investigation with those I accused of harassment, he said. I am truly ashamed of them. They have dishonored every principle and ethics the Police Department stands for, he said. According to Public Defender Jeff Adachi, the officer has not filed a suit with the Police Department and is more interested in seeing change within the department. This is not about money, this about wanting to improve the department, Adachi said. The officer said he has no plans to leave the department and is requesting that officers receive cultural sensitivity education and training, and that the police academy update its curriculum to include Middle Eastern cultural studies along with existing African American, Latino and LGBT cultural studies. The officer, who is still on his probationary period, is choosing to remain anonymous since he plans to stay with the department for years to come. The officer said he has wanted to be a San Francisco police officer since he was 8 years old, after an officer helped his family when they first arrived at San Francisco International Airport from Afghanistan. This comes at a time when there is increasing scrutiny on the Police Department, following the racist text messages, following (the U.S.) Department of Justices COPS (Community Oriented Policing Services) program coming in, and the so-called reforms that were supposedly implemented to ensure that this doesnt happen, Adachi said. Todays allegations come against a backdrop of several other alleged incidents involving misconduct, including two separate racist and homophobic text message scandals in 2015 and 2016. In 2017, Officer Joel Babbs claimed he was being retaliated against for complaining of harassment and discrimination within the department, after he was arrested and charged with using false vehicle registration stickers and filing a false police report, both misdemeanors. According to the San Francisco Police Department, it learned of the allegations in November and immediately began an investigation into them. Currently, there are three ongoing investigations into the incidents being conducted by both SFPD and the citys human resources department. The department said that within the last three years, it has implemented a number of measures that ensure that all members of the public and the department are treated with dignity and respect. The department has instituted implicit bias and procedural justice training for all sworn and civilian members; implemented best practices recommendations from the U.S. Department of Justice; instituted electronic audits of communications; entered into agreements with academic partners to analyze vehicle stops and the use of force; and launched the Not-On-My-Watch campaign to promote improved relations between officers and the public, SFPD said in a statement. — Bay City News; Image by Renee Schiavone, Patch",1,0,3
792,"San Francisco prosecutors today said they will not be filing charges against a transgender woman arrested Friday on suspicion of domestic violence but who has supporters who said she had been defending herself. Davia Spain, a 23-year-old performing artist and filmmaker who works for the SF LGBT Center, was arrested Friday on suspicion of domestic violence, battery and burglary. In an online campaign launched after her arrest, supporters said Spain was defending herself while confronting a person over an alleged sexual assault. Public Defender Jeff Adachi said attorneys from his office spoke with Spain over the weekend and based on their preliminary investigation they are confident the incident was self-defense. This was a situation where the encounter occurred and she was forced to defend herself, this was not a situation where she was the attacker or the aggressor, so for that reason we want this charge to be dismissed, he said. A petition calling for Spains release had gathered more than 1,800 signatures as of this afternoon. She is an important member of our Bay Area TLGB community and we would like her to return home to us as soon as possible, the petition reads. We know that these charges do not have merit, we know that Ms. Spain is not a danger to society and we know that she is unsafe inside SF County Jail. Please consider the voice of the community and release Davia Spain. Rebecca Rolfe, a spokeswoman for the SF LGBT Center, said the organization was strongly supportive of Spain. Alex Bastian, a spokesman for the district attorneys office, this afternoon said prosecutors had made the decision not to file charges after reviewing the case. We make charging decisions based on the law and this case will not be charged, Bastian said. Authorities indicated that there were multiple witnesses to the incident who gave different reports of what had occurred. Both Spain and the reporting victim, at whose home the incident occurred, had minor injuries. — Bay City News; Image by Renee Schiavone, Patch",0,8,5
793,"Sex workers in San Francisco will be able to come forward and report a violent crime without fear of arrest or prosecution for minor drug offenses or prostitution under policies recently adopted by city police and prosecutors, city officials announced Thursday. The policies adopted by police and the district attorneys office, thought to be the first of their kind in the U.S., are intended to protect the safety of sex workers and encourage them to report violent crimes and cooperate with law enforcement. The policies, developed in cooperation with sex worker advocacy organizations including St. James Infirmary and BAYSWAN, are a major step towards addressing violence against women wary of contacting law enforcement because of their criminalized status, said Minouche Kandel, director of womens policy at the citys Department on the Status of Women. >>Also See: Dog Flu Circulating In South Bay Research shows that most sex workers and people being exploited in the sex industry dont go to police when they are attacked or victimized out of fear of being arrested, city officials said. Our hope for this policy is to reduce the harm experienced by sex workers, in particular, women of color and transgender women engaged in the sex trades, who have no protections when reporting violence, or experience mistreatment at the hands of law enforcement, said Johanna Breyer, executive director of St. James Infirmary. The Police Department policy, put out in a bulletin in December, advises officers not to arrest people for sex work or minor drug charges when they come forward as a victim or a witness to report sexual assault, human trafficking, stalking, robbery, assault, kidnapping, threats, blackmail, extortion, burglary or other violent crimes. Sex workers reporting violent crimes will also be referred to community and victim resources. >>Also See: Twilight Home For Sale; 2-For-1 Mountain Cabins: CA Wow Houses Officers investigating a misdemeanor drug violation in which a violator reports being a victim or witness to a violent crime are required to collect and document evidence so that prosecutors can consider seeking a warrant. We understand that many times sex workers are themselves victims of predators and human traffickers, police Chief William Scott said. Our policy is written in the spirit of encouraging sex workers to feel safe coming forward to law enforcement, with the knowledge that they will be treated with respect and their concerns will be taken seriously and investigated. Similarly, the district attorneys office policy states that prosecutors will not charge victims or witnesses of violent crimes for sex work or misdemeanor drug related crimes, or use information gathered from them against them in future case, as long as they have been truthful. In addition, the district attorneys office policy states that prosecutors will not use immigration status against victims or witnesses of violent crimes in any way, or report them to immigration authorities except in cases where they are helping them apply for immigration relief. If we fail to prioritize this populations health and safety they will not come forward and work with law enforcement as witnesses and victims of violence, District Attorney George Gascon said. Ultimately, unreported crimes and criminals pose a threat to everyones public safety. The new policies follow on the heels of the announcement by Supervisor Hillary Ronen of a pilot program funding a mobile outreach van to work with sex workers operating in the Mission District. The van, which will be operated by St. James Infirmary between midnight and 5 a.m., will offer access to health care and services and gather information on the needs of a group that tends to remain in the shadows. Ronen said the pilot program was inspired by complaints from residents about violence and late night arguments associated with sex workers operating in the area of Capp and Shotwell streets, including incidents in which the women were violently attacked. — Bay City News; Image via Shutterstock",0,8,5
794,"A man accused of killing and robbing a San Francisco resident who he had befriended in August has a history of preying on sick elderly men in the gay community, prosecutors alleged in court Tuesday. Michael Phillips, 64, was arrested on Nov. 22 in connection with the death of James Sheahan, a 75-year-old man who was found dead with blunt force injuries on Aug. 14 in the 900 block of Bush Street. Sheahan is thought to have died somewhere between Aug. 11 and the 14th. Prosecutors allege Phillips befriended Sheahan, seeking to act as a sort of caretaker, and tried to get money from him before killing him when he refused. Prosecutor Michael Swart in court said prosecutors had video of Phillips coming in and out of Sheahans apartment, and that a search warrant turned up some of Sheahans belongings in Phillips possession. In addition, Swart said there is evidence that Phillips may have previously stolen items including guns and coins from two other terminally ill elderly men after seeking to serve as a caretaker. Youve got a person here who has a history of taking advantage of older gay men, Swart said. This is not the first person hes preyed on. Those older cases may be difficult to prosecute, however, because the victims are dead or the statute of limitations has expired, Swart said. Deputy Public Defender Kwixuan Maloof said he could not comment on the case until he had time to review it, but noted in court that based on the three-page police report, Im sure theres a lot more to this. Phillips entered a not guilty plea to ten felony counts including murder, first-degree robbery and elder abuse and elder theft, and bail was set at $3 million. He was ordered to return to court Nov. 30 to set a preliminary hearing date. — Bay City News; Image via Shutterstock",1,2,0
795,"The cities of San Francisco, Berkeley, Fremont and Watsonville and Contra Costa, Monterey, Santa Clara and Sonoma counties were among 29 jurisdictions nationwide to receive sanctuary warning letters from the U.S. Department of Justice Wednesday. The letters say the department is concerned that the cities and counties policies may violate a federal law that bars local governments from preventing their employees from communicating with federal immigration agents. Compliance with the law, known as Section 1373, is a condition of Justice Department grants to local governments under a program known as the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Program. Also See: Suspect Slaps, Yells Racial Slurs At BART Rider The letters signed by Acting Assistant Attorney General Alan Hanson ask the cities and counties to submit a response by Dec. 8 explaining whether they have laws, policies or practices that violate the law. The letters also ask the recipients to state whether they would comply with the law if they receive a Byrne grant in the current fiscal year, which began on Oct. 1. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement, Jurisdictions that adopt so-called sanctuary policies also adopt the view that the protection of criminal aliens is more important than the protection of law-abiding citizens and of the rule of law. >>Also See: Amazing Modern Design In El Cerrito Home: $1 Million I urge all jurisdictions found to be potentially out of compliance in this preliminary review to reconsider their policies that undermine the safety of their residents, Sessions said. San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera strongly disagreed with the Justice Departments analysis. San Francisco is in full compliance with federal immigration law, he said in a statement. Herrera said the administration of President Donald Trump is making novel and shifting interpretations of the Section 1373 law, going far beyond its text. The law means what it says, and we follow it, he said. >>Also See: Please Dont Help My Kids Herrera said San Francisco restricts other cooperation with immigration officials, but maintained that such local restrictions dont violate federal laws. This letter is the latest salvo in the barrage of Trump administration threats to sanctuary cities. The law is on our side, and we intend to beat back this threat, just like all the others before it, Herrera asserted. — Bay City News; Image via Shutterstock",0,8,5

797,"A San Francisco police officer arrested on suspicion of possessing child pornography today was booked into San Francisco jail this afternoon on a felony warrant out of Contra Costa County, according to the sheriffs department. Officer Joshua Enea, a 37-year-old Antioch resident and 10-year veteran of the department, was arrested on suspicion of felony possession of child pornography following an investigation by police internal affairs. Police say they learned that Enea might be in possession of child pornography in February, and removed him from direct contact with the public while the case was investigated. Enea is currently suspended without pay. He was booked into San Francisco jail this afternoon with bail set at $100,000. Police released a statement this afternoon saying The publics trust is of the utmost importance to the members of the SFPD. The Department will continue to work hard with the community to build and maintain this trust. Police said they worked with the Contra Costa County District Attorneys Office to file charges in the case. According to Transparent California, Eneas total pay and benefits with the department totaled $191,104.84 in 2016. Enea has appeared twice previously in news stories. In 2010, he was reportedly bit by a graffiti artist who was accused of hate crimes. And in 2015 he appeared in a story about a program in which volunteers drink in front of police to help them learn how to identify intoxicated drivers. Anyone who thinks they may have had suspicious contact with Enea is asked to call Internal Affairs investigators at (415) 882-8420. — Bay City News; Image by Renee Schiavone, Patch",0,8,5

800,"A San Leandro man accused of shooting a Burlingame man in the head at a 2012 Fort Mason Halloween party was sentenced Monday to nine years in prison, but the man is already out of custody due to credit for time served. Hun Chu Saelee, 35, was tried in April on four counts of attempted murder and four counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm in connection with an Oct. 28, 2012 shooting that left Ben Pessah, then 21, in a nearly month-long coma with a severe head injury. However the jury hung on the counts related to Pessah, and acquitted Saelee on charges relating to three of Pessahs companions, who were not injured. Prosecutors alleged Saelee shot Pessah and fired at his friends outside a party at Fort Mason around 12:40 a.m. after a dispute that started when he allegedly grabbed Pessahs girlfriends breast. However Deputy Public Defender Vilaska Nguyen portrayed the shooting as self-defense, alleging that the group had attacked Saelee using racial epithets and pursued him toward his car, where the gun was stored. Saelee had no prior arrest record and had obtained a concealed weapons permit after being shot in a previous attack in 2004. Prosecutors considered recharging Saelee but last month reached a deal in which he pleaded guilty to one count of assault with a semi-automatic firearm. Saelee was sentenced to nine years in prison but had already served nearly five years in jail prior to his release from custody in mid-May. With credit for time served, he will remain out of custody and serve the three years on supervised parole. Mr. Saelee is looking forward to moving on with his life, raising his daughter, and giving back to his community, Nguyen said. — Bay City News; Image via Shutterstock Also See:",0,8,5
801,"San Leandro Police have tracked down the man who drove into San Leandro on Tuesday with a noose hanging from the back of a pickup truck. A photo of the truck circulated on social media, causing concern around the city. Police reported on Thursday, The San Leandro Police Department understands the insensitive nature of this incident and quickly investigated the matter. Our concern was whether the owner of the truck had knowledge of the noose and was possibly the victim of a hate crime. The truck owner, who is not a San Leandro resident, was not the victim of a crime. Police counseled him on the subject and he agreed to remove the noose, they report. This reprehensible behavior cannot occur in our community without inquiry, said Lt. Isaac Benabou. For many people, the noose is symbolic to terrible events in our history. It is important that we continue to educate our public to these acts that may hurt so many.

Officers responded to a shots fired call just after 2 p.m. The person who reported the gunfire also provided a description of the person they believed was responsible. When officers arrived, they spotted a suspect matching the description in the area. According to a written release, He was not compliant with commands that were given by officers and a struggle ensued. During the struggle, a gun was forcibly removed the suspects waistband and the suspect was taken into custody. Police officers then checked the church and found that eight rounds had been fired into a statue at the church. No other damage was found. San Leandro Police Lt. Ted Henderson said, While we are not able to share the full details of this incident because it is still an active investigation, please know that we are taking this investigation seriously. We are investigating this act of vandalism as a hate crime. There is simply no place and no excuse for vandalism aimed at a place of worship in our society.

803,"A disabled homeless man alleged Thursday that Oakland police treated him like a suspect instead of a victim when a sniper who was killed in a confrontation with police last Friday fired multiple shots at him three days before last Fridays incident. Speaking at a news conference at the office of Oakland attorney John Burris, who is representing him and is considering filing a claim or lawsuit on his behalf, 30-year-old Patrick Reddic said Jesse Enjaian fired multiple shots at him on Feb. 14, grazing the back of his head and breaking the windows of his car. Reddic said hed been sleeping in his 2001 Toyota Camry while it was parked in the 9500 block of Las Vegas Avenue, where he said hed regularly parked his car and was known in the neighborhood. Reddic said that when officers responded to the shooting, I was treated like a criminal and officers took him to police headquarters in downtown Oakland, where they handcuffed him while they interviewed him, leaving him with two bruises. Reddic said officers later drove him back to the 9500 block of Las Vegas Avenue but told him that he had to leave the area or else he would be arrested. He said he had to drive away with flat tires and shattered windows to another location. Burris said, This was terrible, terrible police conduct. Burris said Enjaians confrontation with Reddic on Feb. 14 was Enjains second confrontation with neighbors in five days because Enjaian also fired shots in the same block on Feb. 10, damaging another residents car. Burris said Enjaian, a 32-year-old graduate of the University of California at Los Angeles and the University of Michigan Law School who worked in computer software, should have been arrested before he used a rifle last Friday morning to fire multiple shots at residents, parked cars and television news helicopters in the 9500 block of Las Vegas Avenue. According to police, Enjaian also fired shots at officers who responded to the Friday incident and one officer fired a shot that struck Enjaian and killed him. No residents or police officers were injured in the incident last Friday but Reddic said the whole thing could have been avoided. He said, I tried to prevent this massacre from happening. Reddic said he thinks police didnt treat him well because hes black and hes homeless. Burris said hes upset that police allowed Enjaian to continue to live in the neighborhood even though he was an active shooter. Referring to Enjaian, Burris said, Its clear he may have been partially impaired. Burris said hes particularly troubled by the multiple shots that Enjaian fired last Friday because the shooting area is adjacent to Bishop ODowd High School, which two of his grandchildren attend. Reddic said he knew Enjaian before the Feb. 14 incident but he said, I never had a problem with him before. Reddic said he fled to a neighbors house after Enjaian shot at him on Feb. 14 but then ran into Enjaian again and Enjaian told him, Im the person who shot at you and then yelled a racial slur at him and told him to get away from his house. A spokesperson for the Oakland Police said in an email that the department is conducting an internal affairs investigation into the Feb. 10 and Feb. 14 incidents in the 9500 block of Las Vegas Avenue. The spokesperson also said the officer who shot Enjaian last Friday will be investigated by the departments homicide and internal affairs sections and there are also independent and concurrent investigations by the Alameda County District Attorneys Office. Burris said Reddic was traumatized by what happened to him on Feb. 14 and was subjected to humiliation and emotional distress and hes investigating what legal liabilities the Oakland Police Department could face. Burris said Reddic, who uses a cane, became disabled after he was shot multiple times when he was a victim of a robbery in 2013. - Bay City News / Image courtesy Bay City News",1,0,0

806,"San Marino property crime increased by 67 incidents from 2009 to 2010, according to 2010 FBI Uniform Crime Reports released Monday. We deal with such small numbers that I hate to draw conclusions, San Marino Police Department Sergeant Jay Wilburn told Patch Tuesday. I try not to be too alarmed when I see changes like that.  Each year the FBI releases its Uniform Crime Reports, which include an Offenses Known to Law Enforcement category based on agencies submitting 12 months of complete offense data for that year. In the FBIs Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, property crime includes the offenses of burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft, and arson, according to the FBI website. The object of the theft-type offenses is the taking of money or property, but there is no force or threat of force against the victims. San Marino larceny-theft showed the most significant increase in the property crime category—up by 44 incidents—followed by burglary, which increased by 25 incidents. Aggravated assault and violent crime also increased, but on a smaller scale, and forcible rape and robbery decreased by two incidents each. Crime data for San Marinos Offenses Known to Law Enforcement for 2009 and 2010 can be found and compared in the table attached to this article. Wilburn said that property crime still seems to be most common for 2011, but could not give a definitive projection.  Theyre pretty much on par, said Wilburn. We took a big hit last year and it has kind of leveled off. Im not sure if thats driven by the state of the economy. I dont see us having a huge change in 2011. Wilburn suggested San Marino residents join to help keep incidents to a minimum, in addition to the SMPDs efforts. Probably the largest tool to decrease property crime is to be active, be alert and get involved, said Wilburn.",0,8,5

808,"Laws to protect Californians from DUI offenders, help establish an earthquake early warning system, reform the California Public Utilities Commission, increase oversight of building contractors, require police to securely stow any handgun left in a car, improve tour bus safety, crack down on water-guzzling households, and more take effect on January 1. The new laws are the result of 17 bills that were introduced by Senator Jerry Hill, passed by the Legislature and signed by Governor Jerry Brown in 2016. Here are summaries of the bills that led to the new laws and what they do: Senate Bill 24 – JPA Pension Fix for San Mateo County Resolves a pension problem that prevented the cities of San Mateo, Belmont and Foster City from completing their Joint Powers Agreement for shared fire service. It allows the three cities to provide the JPA employees a defined benefit plan that those employees received as classic CalPERS members from their previous employment with the cities. San Mateo County Firefighters and the California Professional Firefighters supported SB 24, along with the cities of San Mateo, Belmont and Foster City. SB 62 – California Public Utilities Commission Office of the Safety Advocate Establishes the Office of the Safety Advocate within the California Public Utilities Commission to advocate for continuous, cost-effective improvement of safety management and safety performance of public utilities. SB 438 – Earthquake Early Warning Implementation Complements the $10 million included in the 2016-2017 budget for the statewide earthquake early warning system by establishing the Earthquake Early Warning Advisory Board within the Governors Office of Emergency Services. The new law brings California closer to statewide implementation of the earthquake early warning system. In emergencies, the alerts sent by the warning system will help prevent devastating and life-threatening missteps. Governor Browns announcement of his signing the bill is here and view video of the press conference held at the Office of Emergency Services headquarters here. SB 465 – Building Construction Contractors: Discipline, Reporting and Building Standards SB 465 is aimed at increasing oversight of contractors by closing the gaps in information that were revealed by the collapse of a balcony at a Berkeley apartment building on June 16, 2015. Ashley Donohoe, 22, of Rohnert Park, her cousin, Olivia Burke, 21, of Ireland, and four of their friends were killed. Seven other students from Ireland, including Aoife Beary who had been celebrating her 21st birthday, were hospitalized for weeks after the balcony gave way and sent them plummeting five stories to the ground. Aoife Beary, her mother Angela, Ashley Donohoes mother, Jackie, and representatives of the Irish Consulate testified to policy committees in the Capitol about the devastating loss felt by families from California to Ireland – and urged legislators to support SB 465, which was co-authored by Senator Loni Hancock, D-Oakland. The new law: SB 512 – Governance, Accountability and Transparency at the California Public Utilities Commission SB 512 reforms the governance structure of the California Public Utilities Commission by more clearly outlining the roles and responsibilities of commissioners and staff, and by requiring the CPUC to reach out to communities affected by CPUC decisions, instead of only to regulated utilities. To do so, SB 512 makes the following statutory changes: It 1) requires the commission to annually approve performance criteria for the commission and the executive director, and to annually evaluate the performance of the executive director based on those criteria; 2) requires the CPUC to reach out to those affected by its proceedings; 3) requires CPUC judges to adhere to ethics provisions of the Administrative Procedures Act; 4) allows the public to receive hearing transcripts at no charge; 5) permits the CPUC to meet in locations other than San Francisco; 6) requires the CPUC to modify its annual report to clarify how long the CPUC takes to finish rate or penalty cases; and 7) allows local governments to receive intervenor compensation when participating in CPUC efforts to improve safety, enabling local governments that have suffered catastrophes to seek such compensation. SB 661 – The Dig Safe Act of 2016 SB 661 addresses safety problems involving excavations and gas pipelines that are beneath soil or are otherwise underground by making clarifications to the so-called one-call law (Call 811 before you dig) and by creating the Safe Excavation Board, an appointed board of excavation stakeholders that is funded by fees on utilities. The board is to 1) investigate accidents and other one-call violations; 2) develop standards for safe excavation; and 3) coordinate education and outreach efforts. SB 812 – Improving Tour Bus Safety Improves the safety and oversight of tour buses operating in California by strengthening the California Highway Patrols tour bus inspection program. The law was prompted by a tour bus accident in San Franciscos Union Square in November 2015 that injured 20 people, at least five critically. After the crash, the CHP determined that the bus had never been inspected and was not registered with the California Public Utilities Commission, as is required by law. The CHP later conducted a surprise inspection of the companys bus fleet and found over 60 violations, 29 for mechanical problems. SB 814 – Cracking Down on Water-Guzzling Households During a Drought A winner of Senator Hills 2016 Oughta Be a Law…Or Not bill idea contest for constituents, SB 814 pulls the plug on excessive water use by households that flout mandatory reductions during drought emergencies. The law requires urban retail water suppliers to set rules for identifying and cracking down on households that consume enormous amounts of water despite restrictions imposed during a statewide declaration of a drought. The new law ensures that every urban retail water supplier has a tool to curb excessive water use by customers. Households that guzzle water – while neighbors and most other Californians abide by mandatory reductions – will no longer be able to hide and persist in their excess. SB 869 – Safe Storage of Police Handguns in Vehicles Another winner of Senator Hills 2016 Oughta Be a Law… contest, SB 869 responds to numerous thefts of handguns that law enforcement officers had left in cars. The stolen firearms included guns used in two murders in the Bay Area. SB 869 closes a legal loophole that had exempted law enforcement officers as well as concealed weapons permit holders from requirements to securely stow handguns in a lockbox out of plain view, or in the trunk, if the weapons are left in an unattended vehicle. SB 996 – Affordable Housing Property Tax Cap Aids local nonprofit and religious organizations that provide affordable housing by increasing the assessed property value exemption from $2,000,000 annually to $10,000,000 annually. The new law applies to three local nonprofits, such as the Saint Francis Center in Redwood City and the Ministry Services of the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul based in Los Altos Hills, which provides housing, food and clothing services to low-income families. SB 996 provides property tax relief to such organizations so that they can continue to provide more affordable housing for low income people and families. SB 1004 – Young Adult Offender Pilot Program Hailed by Governor Brown for its innovation, SB 1004 authorizes a pilot program in five counties, including Santa Clara, to give nonviolent young adult offenders between the ages of 18 and 21 the opportunity to take advantage of supportive and educational services in the juvenile justice system, rather than serve their time in an adult county jail. Although legally considered adults, these young offenders are still undergoing significant brain development, and may be better served by the juvenile justice system with age-appropriate, intensive services. Research shows that people do not develop adult-caliber, decision-making skills until their early 20s. Psychologists note that this maturity gap makes young adults more likely to engage in risk-seeking behavior. SB 1028 – Utility Wildfire Mitigation Plans SB 1028 requires 1) utilities regulated by the California Public Utilities Commission to file wildfire mitigation plans, 2) the CPUC to review those plans, and 3) publicly-owned utilities to also file wildfire mitigation plans with their governing boards. SB 1039 – Business and Professions Omnibus Bill SB 1039 makes several changes to the statutes governing various boards and bureaus under the Department of Consumer Affairs; includes specified fee increases for several boards including the Dental Hygiene Committee of California, the California Board of Optometry, the Board of Registered Nursing, the Board of Pharmacy, and the Contractors State License Board; and eliminates the Telephone Medical Advice Services Bureau. SB 1039 specifies that the continuing education standards established for nurses by the Board of Registered Nursing shall recognize specialized areas of practice, as previously required, and require that content be relevant to the practice of nursing, be related to the scientific knowledge or technical skills required for the practice of nursing, or be related to direct or indirect patient or client care. The legislation requires the nursing board to audit continuing education providers at least once every five years to ensure adherence to regulatory requirements. The new law also requires the board to withhold or rescind approval from any provider that is in violation of the regulatory requirements. SB 1046 – Ignition Interlock Devices for Drunk Driving Offenders Extends a pilot program requiring drunk driving offenders in Alameda, Los Angeles, Sacramento and Tulare counties to install the devices known as IIDs. IIDs are calibrated to the driver and prevent a car from starting if the driver is not sober. The four-county pilot would run until January 1, 2019, when the program would be expanded statewide with minor modifications so that: SB 1046 also creates an early incentive program, providing DUI offenders with full driving privileges soon after arrest if they install an IID. Their ultimate IID time requirement would be reduced based on when the early installation occurred. Low income offenders would be eligible for assistance to pay for an IID based on a sliding scale pegged to household income. SB 1192 – Private Post-Secondary Education SB 1192 changes the California Private Post-Secondary Education Act of 2009 to improve the effectiveness of the Bureau for Private Post-Secondary Education and opportunities for student success, and extends the BPPEs operations for four years. SB 1193 – Healing Arts, Board of Pharmacy, Veterinary Medical Board Sunset Bill SB 1193 makes changes to the Pharmacy Law, Veterinary Practice Act and Psychology Licensing Law to strengthen the laws and improve oversight of licensees by these boards. SB 1196 – Professions and Vocations: Bureau of Real Estate, Bureau of Real Estate Appraisers, and Bureau of Security and Investigative Services Bill SB 1196 ensures that the Bureau of Security and Investigative Services is subject to review by the appropriate policy committees of the Legislature. The legislation changes provisions in the Alarm Company Act, the Locksmith Act, the Private Investigator Act, the Private Security Services Act, Proprietary Security Services Act, and Collateral Recovery Act to improve the oversight, enforcement and regulation of licensees by the bureau. The bill also adds a sunset review date for the Bureau of Real Estate and the Bureau of Real Estate Appraisers, and changes existing laws to improve oversight, enforcement and regulation by the CalBRE and BREA. SB 1196 includes several consumer protection and public safety reforms to operations and oversight by the Bureau of Security and Investigative Services, which licenses about 380,000 companies and employees that provide alarm services, locksmith services, private investigation, private security, repossession services and firearm and baton training. The changes are intended to ensure that an applicant for licensure as an armed security guard is capable of exercising appropriate judgment, restraint and self-control; that armed security guards are qualified for their jobs, and that California regulators step up their policing of the industry. SB 1196 also imposes stricter training standards and requirements to ensure that shootings and incidents of suspected excessive force are investigated. In addition, the new law enables gun permits to be revoked when warranted and improves oversight of companies. – SUBMITTED FOR PUBLICATION BY: Office of State Senator Jerry Hill / Image via Shutterstock",0,8,5
809,"A onetime Menlo Park man was sentenced this week to seven decades in federal prison for traveling repeatedly to Cambodia to molest impoverished children, four of whom testified to grueling sexual attacks that had jurors holding back tears. Ronald John Boyajian was found guilty in March of federal counts of international travel with intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct with minors, engaging in illicit sexual conduct with a minor in foreign places, and commission of a felony offense involving a minor while required to register as a sex offender. Boyajian -- who was previously convicted more than 20 years ago on nearly two dozen counts of statutory rape in Orange County -- declined to participate in his sentencing hearing, telling the court he was unprepared to go forward. Calling Boyajians crimes extremely, extremely serious, U.S. District Judge Christina Snyder imposed the 70-year sentence, ordering lifetime supervised release and mandatory sex offender registration if he is ever released from federal prison. Boyajian, acting as his own attorney, kept the case at a stalemate for seven years prior to the start of the six-week trial in Los Angeles. The case docket has more than 1,500 entries, most of them motions filed almost daily by Boyajian in which he objected to each aspect of the proceedings and accused the judge of conspiring against him behind the scenes. His latest attempt to delay sentencing was denied late last week by Snyder. Federal cases are very complex, especially when there are international aspects and witnesses from abroad, Eileen M. Decker, the U.S. attorney in Los Angeles, told City News Service. We expect these cases to take many years. We are in a unique situation to do this. If we do not address this terrible crime, we fear it would go unpunished. Three women in their 20s, who were children when they were sexually assaulted by the defendant, gave brief victim impact statements last week, telling the judge that the attacks had lasting, painful impacts on their lives. Speaking through a translator, one of the women urged the judge not to allow this man to leave prison because possibly there are other children out there that it could happen to -- just like it happened to me. Crying, she said, I dont want this to happen to other children. I want other children to have a happy life. Another woman told the court that since she was attacked by Boyajian more than seven years ago, she fears men and often finds herself grouchy for no reason. Boyajian, 55, who has lived in Menlo Park and the Palos Verdes area, was sentenced to 30-year terms for each of the two travel offenses and 10 years for committing the offenses while being required by California law to register as a sex offender. It took a federal jury about five hours before returning guilty verdicts on all three counts contained in a federal indictment handed down in September 2009. This case is about a man who wanted to sexually assault children -- and he found a place where he could do that, Assistant U.S. Attorney Vanessa Baehr-Jones told the jury at the start of the trial. Boyajian was arrested by the Cambodian National Police in February 2009 while on his 35th trip to Asia over a nine-year period. Boyajian began traveling to Cambodia -- one of Southeast Asias poorest countries -- shortly after completing his parole following convictions in Orange County for illegal sex with a minor and oral sex with a minor in 1994. Federal prosecutors presented evidence the defendant sexually assaulted girls who were between 8 and 11. One victim, who was 8 when she was molested, testified that he was cruel -- he treated me like I wasnt even human. Boyajian paid pimps and sometimes the victims relatives to have access to the children. The attacks took place in the village of Svay Pak -- known as Kilo 11 because it is located 11 kilometers outside of Cambodias capital city of Phnom Penh -- where the victims were Vietnamese immigrants who lived in the poor community. A Cambodian police anti-human trafficking officer testified that Svay Pak was notorious as a place where foreigners went to have sexual contact with young girls. Boyajian went to Svay Pak to have unlimited access, prosecutors said. One of the females he assaulted -- now an adult working in Cambodia to help fellow victims of predators -- told jurors that Boyajian paid her grandmother to leave her alone with him in a wooden shack. She described being raped, beaten and bitten on the legs and calves by the defendant during multiple attacks. Boyajian was among the first defendants charged under an international law enforcement initiative specifically targeting Americans traveling to Cambodia for the purpose of sexually abusing children. Operation Twisted Traveler was an effort by the Justice Department and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to crack down on sex tourism. Boyajian has been in custody in Los Angeles since his removal from Cambodia seven years ago. In the years since he was charged, Boyajian lodged a raft of motions and continuances, ensuring the case remained deadlocked. In the minutes before the jury was called into the courtroom for opening statements on Feb. 3, Boyajian made a motion to have Snyder removed from the case. Following the verdicts, the defendant immediately filed motions objecting to the jurys racial mix, among other complaints. The investigation of Boyajian was begun by the Cambodian non- governmental organization Action Pour Les Enfants -- APLE -- whose investigators said they witnessed Boyajian visiting a child brothel in Svay Pak. It was here -- halfway across the world -- that foreigners like the defendant could freely target children who were being sold into prostitution, Baehr-Jones told the jury. Boyajian was charged under the Protect Act, which became law in 2003 and made it easier for U.S. authorities to prosecute people for overseas sex crimes. Federal authorities have made more than 70 arrests under the act in countries including Cambodia, Thailand and the Philippines. – By FRED SHUSTER, City News Service.",1,8,0
810,"SAN FRANCISCO -- A judge on Thursday denied a motion for an injunction calling for increased security at San Francisco Pride events set to take place later this month, saying there wasnt time for changes to be made to the event. Attorney Ryan Lapine sought the injunction after filing lawsuits in San Francisco Superior Court last month on behalf of three people injured in shootings at the Civic Center Pride Celebration in 2013 and 2015. Shootings and other violent incidents have taken place in connection with Pride events nearly ever year since 2010, including a fatal shooting at the 2010 Pink Saturday celebration in the Castro District. That event has been canceled this year, in part due to security concerns by previous organizers. In his motion for an injunction, Lapine argued that other Pride celebrations around the country employ security measures including fencing, bag and security screening, and restrictions on alcohol, in order to reduce the risk of such incidents. He sought to have such measures put in place at the Civic Center celebration, including a possible move to a more secure location. Statements submitted as evidence indicate the San Francisco Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender Pride Celebration Committee has been warned of the security risks by police but chose not to increase security. However Judge Joseph Quinn on Thursday found that those statements were inadmissible for the purposes of the injunction. In addition, he ruled that the motion was filed too close to the event to give the Pride Committee any reasonable chance of making the changes it calls for. Outside of court, Lapine said he was delayed in filing the case by legal maneuvering that succeeded in keeping evidence from a previous case confidential and inaccessible until February. But despite the failure of the injunction, he plans to continue litigating the case. While concerned about security, especially following the weekends mass shooting in Orlando, Lapine said he hoped people would still attend Pride events. I hope that everyone still attends, I dont want that to stop, but just be vigilant, Lapine said. Understand that the committee doesnt really have security at the perimeters, so if you see something, go and report it to police, because the committee has abandoned their duties. SF Pride spokesman Sam Singer said that following the weekends shooting at an Orlando gay nightclub, the Pride Committee is working with police, the FBI and other federal law enforcement agencies to bring in additional security measures for the Civic Center celebration and parade. Those attending the events will see more uniformed officers, but most of the security measures will be invisible, Singer said. This is a very safe event, its a public event, Singer said. Its an opportunity to memorialize those who lost their lives to an act of terrorism in the LGBT community. Its an opportunity also to express joy at all the gains in civil rights the LGBT community has made. --Bay City News/Patch file photo",0,8,5

Around 11:30 p.m., the student reported the incident, which occurred near the schools Quarry Amphitheater, according to police. The student said she was walking on a footpath northwest from the Quarry Plaza when three men began calling out to her in an offensive manner, police said. When on student continued walking, one of the suspects then threw a rock at her, striking her in the head. The woman was able to flee the area and get help, according to police. She suffered minor injuries from the assault and emergency personnel treated her at the scene. Campus police are investigating the incident as a possible hate crime, police said. The suspects were described as three men in their early 20s. The assault may have been committed because of the actual or perceived protected characteristics of gender or sexuality of the student, campus officials said. The first suspect was unshaven and wore sweatpants with a dark baseball cap. The second suspect wore a light colored sweatshirt and no further description was given for the third suspect, according to police.

814,"An Indiana man pleaded no contest Wednesday to three felony charges stemming from an arrest in Santa Monica where police seized weapons, ammunition and bomb-making materials found in his car while heading to the 2016 LA Pride parade in West Hollywood. He was immediately sentenced to seven years and four months in state prison. James Wesley Howell, 22, pleaded no contest to one count each of unlawful assault weapon activity, possession of a destructive device on a public road or highway and possession of a destructive device, Deputy District Attorney Samuel Hulefeld said. Howell was arrested shortly before 6 a.m. on June 12, 2016, by Santa Monica police in the 1700 block of 11th Street, near Olympic Boulevard – mere hours after the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, that left 49 people and the gunman dead. Howell was found sitting in his car when officers responded to a report of a man knocking on a residents door and window. Officers examined Howells white Acura sedan with Indiana license plates and recovered three assault rifles, high-capacity magazines and ammunition along with a five-gallon bucket with chemicals that could have been used to make an improvised explosive device, police said. The sheriffs department bomb squad was called to help make certain the vehicle and area were safe. According to court documents, Howell also had a buck knife, a Taser, a black hood, handcuffs and a security badge in his car. Howell told police he was planning to attend the 46th annual LA Pride Parade and Festival in West Hollywood, but made no reference to doing harm there, according to Santa Monica police Lt. Saul Rodriguez. Santa Monica police Chief Jacqueline Seabrooks and Rodriguez said there was no known connection between Howell and the mass shooting in Orlando. Security was increased at the LA Pride festival as a result of the Orlando massacre and Howells arrest. During Howells arraignment on June 14, 2016, the prosecutor said the defendant had 20 pounds of explosive mix in his car, along with five gallons of gasoline – materials that could create an explosive similar to the one used in the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building. Some of the materials were already mixed in a bucket in the car, the prosecutor said. One day after the charges were filed against him in Los Angeles, Howell was charged with sexually molesting a 12-year-old girl in Indiana. According to the Indianapolis Star, Indiana officials believe Howell left for California after learning he was under investigation in the molestation case. Citing court documents and the victims family, the newspaper also reported that Howell threatened to kill himself, members of the victims family and police if they tried to arrest him.

815,"- An Indiana man who was bound for the LA Pride parade in West Hollywood when he was arrested in Santa Monica, where police seized weapons, ammunition and bomb-making materials found in his car, was ordered Tuesday to stand trial. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Upinder S. Kalra found sufficient evidence to require James Wesley Howell, 20, to proceed to trial on one felony count each of possession of a destructive device on a public street, possession of an assault weapon and manufacturing or importing a high-capacity magazine, along with a misdemeanor count of possession of a loaded firearm in a vehicle, according to Deputy District Attorney Sean Carney. Howell remains jailed in lieu of $2 million bail while awaiting arraignment March 28 at the Airport Branch Courthouse in Los Angeles. Howell was arrested shortly before 6 a.m. last June 12 by Santa Monica police in the 1700 block of 11th Street, near Olympic Boulevard -- hours after the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, left 49 people and the gunman dead.

816,"- The Living Torah Center Chabad in Santa Monica was vandalized sometime early Sunday morning or late Saturday night by someone who smeared feces and rice on the front window near a menorah display, according to authorities and officials at the synagogue. The discovery of the vandalism at 1130 Wilshire Boulevard was made by Rabbi Boruch Rabinowitz when he arrived early Sunday morning on the first day of Hanukkah. The vandalism did not include any anti-Semitic messages, but officials at the Living Torah Center Chabad on Wilshire Boulevard told the Los Angeles Times they suspect the building was targeted for religious reasons. This seems kind of intentional, Assistant Rabbi Dovid Tenenbaum told The Times. With a religious artifact in the window, we have to assume so. Santa Monica police officers came to the location and took a report, but no witnesses have come forward. We received a call about the vandalism shortly before 9 a.m. A report was taken and it will be investigated, Santa Monica police Sgt. Erika Aklufi told City News Service. Right now we are not classifying it as a hate crime, just as vandalism. Aklufi also said police have no suspects at this point and have not yet been able to pinpoint the time the vandalism was committed. Tenenbaum said the synagogue will soon install video cameras. The congregation is accustomed to occasional anti-Semitism, Tenenbaum told the newspaper. During a service about a month ago, Tenenbaum said, a man stood up and shouted Heil, Hitler, positioning his arms as if shooting a rifle. He ran away before anyone could catch him. About a year ago, a letter left in the synagogues mailbox contained a swastika and a message: Get out of here, you Jews. The night before, the congregation had celebrated the start of Hanukkah with menorah lighting, latkes and doughnuts at Rabinowitzs house. Rabinowitz arrived at the synagogue a little before 8 a.m. on Sunday morning to prepare for a service and found the noxious substances on the window. -- City News Service, photo via Google Maps",1,3,2

He was also charged with one misdemeanor count of carrying a loaded firearm in a vehicle. Howell was arrested in Santa Monica early Sunday morning after a resident called police to report a possible prowler. Police found Howell sitting in his car, and a subsequent search found three rifles -- an AM-15 .223 caliber rifle with two 30-round magazines, a .30-06 caliber bolt-action rifle and a .22 caliber Ruger semi-automatic rifle, according to court records. Prosecutors believe the weapons were bought by Howells father. Police also found 25 pounds of Shoc-Shot, a target explosives to let shooters know when theyve hit a target, in his car, court records show. Howell told police he was in town for the 46th annual Los Angeles Gay Pride Festival and Parade. The arrest came hours after a gunman killed 49 people and injured 53 others at a gay Orlando nightclub. Howells court-appointed attorney entered a not guilty plea on his behalf. Howell does have a history of gun violence. He was charged with felony intimidation and felony pointing a firearm last year in Indiana. Howell pointed a gun at a neighbor during an argument, according to Indiana court records. He agreed to plead guilty in April this year to a misdemeanor intimidation charge, and prosecutors agreed to drop the weapon charge. Howell was sentenced to one year in state prison. That sentence was suspended and Howell was placed on probation. As a condition of his probation, Howell agreed to surrender all weapons to authorities. On Monday, Indiana prosecutors filed a petition to revoke his probation, court records show. The judge granted prosecutors request to raise his bail from $500,000 to $2 million, citing his Indiana conviction and the fact that he drove from Indiana to Santa Monica, where he had no known connection. They considered him a flight risk. On Monday night the FBI searched Howells residence in Indiana, Laura Eimiller of the Los Angeles Bureau said. The FBI was helping with the investigation.

820,"Santa Monica, CA — An Indiana man, who was arrested in Santa Monica on Sunday with assault rifles and explosive powders, is scheduled to appear in court Tuesday. James Wesley Howell, 20, was arrested at around 5 a.m. Sunday on weapons and explosives charges, police said. He was arrested on the 1700 block of 11th Street after a resident notified police of a possible prowler, the Santa Monica Police Department said. The suspect was reportedly knocking on a residents door and window prompting the call to SMPD, Lt. Saul Rodriguez said. Howell said he was there to meet a friend. A subsequent search of the car found three assault rifles, high-capacity magazines and ammunition in addition to a five-gallon bucket of chemicals capable of forming an improvised explosive device, Rodriguez said. According to unconfirmed reports, the chemical was Tannerite, which is used as an exploding rifle target to let shooters know when theyve hit a target, according to the companys spokesman Dan Tanner. The powder can only be detonated by high-velocity impact, such as a bullet strike, making it unlikely to be used as an improvised bomb, he said. Santa Monica Police Department Chief Jacqueline Seabrooks said via Twitter that Howell told a police officer about wanting to harm Gay Pride event, which was happening in West Hollywood. Rodriguez said later, however, that Howell said only he was planning to attend the event and made no reference to doing any harm. He did not make any additional statements saying he was going to do anything further than attending the event, Rodriguez said. The arrest came hours after a shooting rampage at an gay Orlando nightclub where at least 50 people were killed and another 53 were injured. Authorities said there were no connections to the Orlando attack. Howell was arrested seven miles from the annual Los Angeles Gay Pride Festival. Howell is scheduled to appear at the LAX Superior Court at 8:30 a.m. Tuesday, but that could change as the FBI, which is assisting with the investigation, is consulting with prosecutors about possible federal charges, the bureaus spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said. He is being held at the Twin Towers Correction Center in lieu of a $500,000 bail. Howell has a history of gun violence. Last year, he was charged with two felonies, intimidation and pointing a firearm at another person. In a plea agreement, Howell agreed to plead guilty to intimidation and prosecutors dropped the firearm charge, according to Indiana court records. Howell was sentenced to one year in state prison with a suspended sentence and placed on probation. As part of the plea deal, Howell agreed to surrender all weapons to police during the term of his probation, court records show. On Monday, Indiana prosecutors filed a petition to revoke his probation, according to court records. --Photo courtesy of the Santa Monica Police Department",1,4,1
821,"SANTA MONICA - A onetime Southland resident was found guilty Monday of traveling repeatedly to Cambodia to sexually assault impoverished children, four of whom testified to grueling sexual attacks that had jurors blinking back tears. Delays kept the case against Ronald John Gerard Boyajian at a stalemate for seven years prior to the start of the month-long trial. This case is about a man who wanted to sexually assault children -- and he found a place where he could do that, Assistant U.S. Attorney Vanessa Baehr-Jones said. Boyajian traveled to Cambodia -- one of Southeast Asias poorest countries -- about three dozen times between 2002 and 2009, where he engaged in sexual activity with Vietnamese girls between the ages of 8 and 11 in a village outside Phnom Penh frequented by child molesters and known as Kilo 11. One of the girls -- now an adult working in Cambodia to help fellow victims of sexual predators -- told jurors that Boyajian paid her grandmother to leave her alone with him in a wooden shack. She described being raped, beaten and bitten on the legs and calves by the defendant during multiple attacks. Asked by prosecutors to identify her attacker after she took the stand last month, the girl slowly walked to the center of the area in front of the judge, met the gaze of every male in the room, then turned to the defendant and pointed to him. The federal jury deliberated for about five hours before returning guilty verdicts on all three counts contained in a federal indictment initially handed down in September 2009. Boyajian, who represented himself during the trial, seemed to nod his head as the verdicts were read, but otherwise showed no reaction. The United States is the world leader in civil rights, and if you are an American and you hurt a child -- no matter where it takes place in the world -- you will be prosecuted, Assistant U.S. Attorney David Herzog said outside court. All children must be protected from sexual predators -- and todays verdicts confirm that. Boyajian -- who was previously convicted in 1994 on nearly two dozen counts of statutory rape in Orange County -- was found guilty Monday of international travel with intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct with minors, engaging in illicit sexual conduct with a minor in foreign places, and commission of a felony offense involving a minor while required to register as a sex offender. He faces up to 30 years behind bars, with sentencing tentatively set for June 13 by U.S. District Judge Christina A. Snyder. Boyajian, now 55, was among the first defendants charged under an international law enforcement initiative specifically targeting Americans traveling to Cambodia for the purpose of sexually abusing children. Operation Twisted Traveler was an effort by the Justice Department and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to crack down on sex tourism. Boyajian has been in custody in Los Angeles since his removal from Cambodia seven years ago. In the years since he was charged, Boyajian lodged a raft of motions and continuances, ensuring the case remained deadlocked. In the minutes before the jury was called into the courtroom for opening statements, Boyajian made a motion to have Snyder removed from the case. When the jury left the courtroom after delivering its verdicts, the defendant told the judge to expect several new motions in the coming weeks, including one objecting to the jurys racial mix. This verdict was a long time coming, but the government is committed to prosecuting these types of crimes -- no matter the hurdles, Baehr-Jones told City News Service. These types of repeat offenders will not escape justice no matter where they travel and no matter how long it takes. The investigation of Boyajian was begun by the Cambodian non- governmental organization Action Pour Les Enfants -- APLE -- whose investigators said they witnessed Boyajian visiting a child brothel in Svay Pak, a red-light district on the outskirts of the capital Phnom Penh. It was here -- halfway across the world -- that foreigners like the defendant could freely target children who were being sold into prostitution, Baehr-Jones told the panel during her opening statement. In September, an 81-year-old pedophile who previously served time for molesting a Southern California child was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison for having sexual contact with two 12-year-old boys in Southeast Asia. Jack Dad Sporich was expelled from Cambodia in 2009 and -- like Boyajian -- charged in Los Angeles as a result of Operation Twisted Traveler. Witnesses said Sporich, who once lived in Santa Monica, drove his motor bike through the streets of the resort town of Siem Riep, dropping Cambodian currency to attract children. A third Southland man -- Erik Alex Peeters -- pleaded guilty in Los Angeles federal court to international travel and engaging in illicit sexual conduct with minors, and is expected to be sentenced later this year. Peeters engaged in sexual activity with at least three Cambodian boys whom he paid $5 to $10 for sex, prosecutors said. Boyajian, Sporich and Peeters were charged under the Protect Act, which became law in 2003 and made it easier for U.S. authorities to prosecute people for overseas sex crimes. Federal authorities have made more than 70 arrests under the act in countries including Cambodia, Thailand and the Philippines. --City News Service, photo via Shutterstock",1,8,0
822,"President Barack Obama left Los Angeles today, concluding a 19-hour-plus visit to the area. A motorcade that left about 10:10 a.m. took Obama to LAX, from where he boarded a flight to Palm Springs. A motorcycle officer assigned to the protective services detail that handles travel security for Obama was involved in a non-injury accident at about 10:20 a.m., on the southbound San Diego (405) Freeway at Olympic Boulevard in West Los Angeles, apparently while escorting the president from Westwood to LAX. While in the Southland, Obama criticized the tenor of the campaign to succeed him. Youre seeing in our election cycle a lot of the anger and frustration, Obama said at the first of two fundraisers in Hancock Park Thursday night. Some of it is manufactured for political purposes, some of it is hype. But the frustrations are there, and they are real. There are people who are afraid. They watch the evening news, whats happening in Syria and other troubled parts of the world. Fear, if not unaddressed, if not channeled, can result in some pretty ugly politics. It has never been more important for us as citizens to fight against that fear. Obama is scheduled for a weekend of golf in Palm Springs, prior to attending a summit of leaders from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Obama will be joined there by Secretary of State John Kerry. In an appearance Thursday on The Ellen DeGeneres Show set to air today, Obama criticized what he called the Instagram culture -- We expect quick answers without sacrifice. He also complained about what he described as politics that demonize opponents and about factually incorrect news. Following the taping of the show, Obama flew from Burbank on Marine One, the presidential helicopter, to Los Angeles High School. He then traveled by motorcade to the Hancock Park home of entertainment lawyer Aaron Rosenberg and Danny Rose, a producer of the CBS drama Scorpion, for a reception, concert and fundraiser for about 340 people. Tickets ranged from $1,000 per person to as high as $33,400 per couple, which included prime seating and admission to a reception with a presidential photo line. Some of the money went to the Democratic Hope Fund, which helps retire Obamas campaign debt. Obama began a nearly 20-minute speech by telling the crowd he keeps a checklist in his desk of campaign promises he made. We havent gotten 100 percent of what I wanted to get done, but we got about 80, Obama said. We have made progress. The country is indisputably better off now than it was. However, there is still work to be done, he said, citing Los Angeles needs. Right now as we speak, there are children in this city who have no place to sleep, Obama said. Theres still millions of people that dont have health insurance. Obama cited climate change, health insurance and lesbian and gay rights as other areas where there was still work to be done. The fundraiser also included John Legend singing his hit All of Me. Obamas second fundraiser of the night, also in Hancock Park, was what was described by the Democratic National Committee as a discussion and dinner, with tickets costing $10,000 per person. The fundraisers were the 38th and 39th Obama has attended in Los Angeles County as president. He has taken part in fundraisers during 21 of his 24 visits to Los Angeles and Orange counties as president. --City News Service, photo via Wiki Commons",0,8,5
823,"An 81-year-old pedophile who previously served time for molesting a Southern California child was sentenced today to 10 years in federal prison for having sexual contact with two 12-year-old boys in Southeast Asia. Jack Dad Sporich was expelled from Cambodia in 2009 and charged in a three-count federal indictment in Los Angeles as a result of a crackdown on sex tourists who travel to Southeast Asia to engage in illicit sex with children. Witnesses said Sporich, who once lived in Santa Monica, drove his motor bike through the streets of the resort town of Siem Riep, dropping Cambodian currency to attract children. Several boys stayed at his home in Cambodia, which had a swimming pool, water slide, video games, toys and clothing, authorities said. One of the victims, who was brought to Los Angeles to testify at todays hearing, told U.S. District Judge Philip S. Gutierrez through a translator that after the defendants arrest, he was threatened by Sporichs adopted adult children. He said he felt forced to leave his family and move to Cambodias capital city of Phnom Penh for safety. Speaking softly, he added that Sporichs adopted foster children are all grown up and they hate me. Sporich apparently moved to Cambodia in 2005, a year after his release from Atascadero State Hospital, a maximum security psychiatric center for sexually violent predators. In 1987, Sporich was convicted in Ventura County of lewd acts with a child under 14 years of age and sentenced to 18 years behind bars. In June, Gutierrez rejected efforts by Sporich to withdraw his May 2010 plea to traveling overseas for the purpose of engaging in illicit sexual conduct with minors. Under his plea deal, Sporich was sentenced today to the 120-month prison term, five years of supervised release and lifetime sex offender registration. Gutierrez also fined the defendant $125,000 and ordered him to pay about $15,000 in restitution to Hagar International, an organization which helps victims of human rights abuses in Cambodia and elsewhere. The judge said the plea agreement was very difficult for me to accept, adding that he was concerned that Sporich would resume abusing children when he is released. To expect that this man is going to do anything other than hurt children is fantasy land, Gutierrez said. This is a man thats already served 18 years (on child sex charges) -- and 18 years was not enough to stop him. Ten (more) years isnt enough to stop him. A longer sentence would be much more appropriate. Sporich was arrested by Cambodian authorities after two boys said they had been repeatedly molested by him. In summer 2009, Sporich was expelled from the country and brought to Los Angeles to face trial. Given an opportunity to address the court, Sporich apologized for the things that happened, and told the judge that he has a now-grown son in Cambodia who was not abused, touched or anything. Unfortunately, a lot of things happened with other children, Sporich said. Im truly sorry for the things Ive done -- and they have to live with it. Gutierrez said the one factor in Sporichs favor was his age. Sporich and two other men were charged six years ago under the Protect Act, which became law in 2003 and made it easier for U.S. authorities to prosecute people for overseas sex crimes. Federal authorities have made more than 70 arrests under the act in countries including Cambodia, Thailand and the Philippines. City News Service",1,8,0

The agencies will be collectively honored as one of three group recipients of the Helene & Joseph Sherwood Family Prize for Combating Hate. Other groups being honored are the Los Angeles Police Department for its Community Safety Partnership Program, a collaboration with the Los Angeles Housing Authority; and human-trafficking investigators from the state Attorney Generals Office, Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department and Long Beach Police Department and City Prosecutors Office. Carrie Braun, public affairs manager for the Orange County Sheriffs Department, will be honored individually for creating the Diversity Advisory Council that works to foster relationships between law enforcement and the black community, Turkish Muslims and LGBT residents. This years honorees have taken creative and effective steps to make our communities safer, said Amanda Susskind, director of the ADLs Pacific Southwest Region. Their contributions range from fighting terrorism to reducing hate against the most vulnerable in our society. What they have in common is that they make a tangible difference in protecting the community. The agencies that will be honored for their work on the San Bernardino attack that killed 14 people include the San Bernardino Police Department, FBI, San Bernardino County Sheriffs Department, California Highway Patrol, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, U.S. Attorneys Office and police departments from Colton, Fontana, Redlands and Rialto.

826,"Robert Matheson viewed the child porn imagery on his laptop as a novelty, sought stories about the abuse of a 10-year-old boys on a gay erotica website, indicated that he wanted to find a man who could pass as his grandson and wanted the privilege to guide and teach young boys through puberty, according to a sworn affidavit. (Warning, the affidavit contains graphic descriptions. It can be read to the right of this article.) The affidavit, submitted by Department of Homeland Security Special Agent Ricardo J. Rodriguez, was attached to the search warrant for the 66-year-old Mathesons Sierra Madre home. Rodriguez, who is assigned to the agencys Child Exploitation Investigations Group, outlined Mathesons original arrest in Canada, which uncovered the bevy of disturbing imagery on his laptop. The affidavit also goes into graphic detail about the material on Mathesons laptop, which contained thousands of images, more than 200 videos and literary features focused on young boys and sex. One excerpt from the affidavit, taken from a Canadian investigators questioning of Matheson in October, outlined that Matheson didnt originally see an issue with the imagery found in his computer. MATHESON stated that he knew material on his laptop was prohibited, but he had just not got around to deleting it. MATHESON also claimed that the last time he searched for child pornography was two to three years ago. MATHESON further stated that at one time, he found the types of images on his computer to be a novelty and that as long as the boys were not under duress, images of boys engaged in sex is acceptable. Some of the other notes in the affidavit include: The Sierra Madre Police Department is also as police investigate any potential related crimes. So far, none has come forward.

827,"- A woman was arrested Friday on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon following a fight with a mother carrying a child in a store in unincorporated Santa Rosa, a Sonoma County sheriffs spokesman said. Deputies arrested 52-year-old Santa Rosa woman Marion Forrest after they responded at 1:51 p.m. to the Dollar Tree store at 777 Sebastopol Road. The sheriffs office has also asked the district attorney to see if the offenses were a hate crime because a witness said someone said to the mother to shut her Mexican baby up. Sheriffs spokesman Sgt. Spencer Crum said, however, Its going to be a far stretch. The alleged fight between Forrest and the mother started when the child in the mothers arms was crying. Crum said Forrest allegedly told the mother to quiet her child and an argument started. Forrest allegedly started fighting the mother even though Forrests sister tried to stop her. Crum said a male employee intervened and he was allegedly hit on the head with a product separator. After that, the mother and Forrests sister Frankie Brouwer, 47, of Santa Rosa, allegedly started fighting. It kind of became a melee, Crum said. No one was injured but Brouwer was arrested on suspicion of battery and child abuse. Deputies asked the district attorney to charge Forrest with the same offenses. The mother had three children with her ages 2, 4 and 13. She was holding the 2-year-old. Crum said the offenses would rise to the level of a hate crime if Forrest wanted the baby to shut up because it was Hispanic rather than because it was just crying. Crum said the district attorney will make that decision. By Bay City News Service Photo via Mike Mozart/Flickr Creative Commons",0,8,5

833,"LOS ANGELES (CNS) - Civil rights groups sued the Los Angeles Police Department and the Sheriffs Department today over both agencies alleged failure to produce records related to the use of automatic license plate readers. According to the lawsuit filed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation andthe American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, the LAPD and the Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department refuse to provide requested information on policy and training, as well as a weeks worth of ALPR data collected by the agencies last year. Mounted on squad cars and telephone poles, the camera systems read license plates and record the time, date, and location a particular car was encountered. The plaintiffs allege they filed requests under the California PublicRecords Act for the documents, but while the departments produced some materials, they failed to give up materials related to the sharing ofinformation with other agencies. Neither agency has produced data collected during the one-week period, according to the complaint filed in Los Angeles Superior Court. Neither law enforcement agency immediately released a response to the suit. Location-based information like license plate data can be very revealing, said Jennifer Lynch, an EFF staff attorney. By matching your car to a particular time, date and location -- and building a database of that information over time -- law enforcement can learn where you work and live, what doctor you go to, which religious services you attend and who your friends are, she said. The public needs access to data the police actually have collected to be able to make informed decisions about how ALPR systems can and cant be used.

835,"- Law enforcement authorities and Muslim community leaders Monday condemned a series of letters sent to area mosques denouncing Muslims and warning of a pending cleansing of America under President Donald Trump, and local officials urged anyone who receives such a letter to come forward. I would encourage you, the community, that if you receive letters like this, please report them, said Stephen Woolery, FBI special agent in charge of the bureaus Counterterrorism Division in Los Angeles. Because we know that there is under-reporting in a number of crimes that occur. We encourage you to report these things so we can get to the bottom of it and we can keep the community safe. Joined by officials from the Los Angeles Police Department, Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department. Los Angeles School Police and Muslim community organizations, Woolery said the letters contained awful, awful language against Muslims, but did not contain any specific threat. Officials with the Council on American-Islamic Relations chapters in Anaheim and the San Francisco Bay Area reported that the mosques received a hand-written letter calling Muslims vile and filthy people, and telling them to pack your bags and get out of Dodge. The letters said President-elect Donald Trump would cleanse America and make it shine again. And, hes going to start with you Muslims. The letters were addressed to Children of Satan, and warned that Trump was going to do to you Muslims what Hitler did to the Jews. Woolery said the letters were delivered to the Islamic Center of Southern California in Los Angeles, along with mosques in Signal Hill, Northridge, Claremont and San Jose. He also said a similar letter was sent to a mosque in Georgia. The letters that were seeing, they all look similar in language, he said. I dont want to be too absolute but they look like they come from the same author. Los Angeles Police Department Deputy Chief Michael Downing said the letters sent to the Islamic Center of Southern California and the mosque in Northridge were postmarked Nov. 19. Were asking all communities -- if youve received letters like this to make sure you report those, Downing said at the news conference at the Islamic Center of Southern California. Hateful rhetoric creates fear among so many communities, and I think its also caused by people who are fearful of communities that are different from themselves, Downing said. ... The real message here is we are all Americans. This is our home, whether youre Christian, Muslim or Jew. Salam Al-Marayati, president of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, said he and other community leaders want to reassure people who are targets of hateful language or bullying that they are not alone. We will meet this kind of hate with force, he said. Let me just speak directly to the person who wrote these letters to the mosques: You are a coward -- unless you come here and debate the points that you apparently believe so much in. So let us bring this darkness that you are in to light, and let us discuss these issues directly ... Al-Marayati pointed to anti-Muslim sentiment among a fringe element of America that includes conspiracy theories about Muslims and Islam. The more you repeat a lie, the more it becomes fact, he said. So let us debate these issues out in the open. -- City News Service, photo courtesy of CAIR",1,3,3

Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas recommended the review of anti-bias programs and focused on training for sheriffs cadets. However, he and the board also requested information from the Probation Department, District Attorneys Office, Public Defender and Alternate Public Defender, Superior Court and Fire Department. This is an unprecedented moment in the history of our nation, Ridley- Thomas said. He later added, There is no denying that there is a crisis of confidence in law enforcement. The decision comes a month into Black Lives Matters sit-in outside LA City Hall, calling for the ousting of LAPD Chief Charlie Beck. In his motion, Ridley-Thomas pointed out that training criteria and certification for law enforcement professionals in California prohibit racial profiling, but said less overt bias can be equally damaging.

Ahmad Benson filed the lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court against Hudson News, which sells magazines, snacks and drinks at such places as Los Angeles International Airport, which the plaintiff serviced while working at warehouse in Carson from May 20l4 until February. The suit filed Monday alleges harassment, retaliation, failure to prevent discrimination and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Benson is seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. A Hudson News representative did not immediately reply to a request for comment. According to the lawsuit, Bensons supervisor did nothing to stop two co- workers from making racial taunts against him and even uttered some offensive remarks herself. It was common for plaintiffs supervisor to address him as (N---a,) the suit alleges. Shortly after Benson was hired, he says he was questioned about his ownership of a 2009 Mercedes-Benz C300. According to his lawsuit, his supervisor asked him, Are you selling drugs? There is no way a black man can have a car like that if he is not selling drugs. The alleged harassment escalated from comments about his car to Bensons African ethnicity and the fact that he lived for many years in Ghana, his suit alleges. The supervisor asked Benson, When you were in Africa, would you fight over food with the lions because there isnt any food?, according to his lawsuit. He alleges the supervisor also told the other employees, Be careful, Ahmad came from Africa and he might give you Ebola. With his boss present, other Hudson News employees frequently referred to blacks as N---as and said they like eating chicken, cornbread, greens and watermelon, the suit states. Bensons supervisor would laugh and mock Benson instead of becoming upset at the racial remarks, the suit alleges. The boss also chuckled when another Hudson employee called the plaintiff a black Somali pirate, the suit states. A co-worker asked Benson if he ran around bull-naked and lived up a tree like a monkey, and yet another said Africans eat their own and practice cannibalism when there was no food, according to his complaint. When Benson asked his supervisor to put a stop to the taunts, she replied, Everyone is a little racist, according to the lawsuit, which alleges some of the co-workers also made sexually oriented remarks toward Benson.

838,"A man accused of drugging and raping multiple men over a seven-year period starting in 2007 pleaded not guilty Friday to 41 felony counts related to the accusations, according to the San Mateo County District Attorneys Office. Prosecutors say that Joseph Paul Courtney, 31, of Pacifica, met three different men for consensual sex and allegedly ended up drugging them into unconsciousness before raping them. Courtney allegedly raped the men along with unidentified male associates, according to prosecutors. On at least one occasion, after regaining consciousness, the victim was allegedly shown a video recording of multiple men engaged in sex with him while he was passed out, prosecutors said. One of the men who saw such a recording of himself reported the alleged rape to Pacifica police, said District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe. At least 14 additional victims then came forward after media reports of the crimes, Wagstaffe said. Additionally, Courtney allegedly raped the men in full knowledge that he has AIDS, according to Wagstaffe. Courtneys attorney, Steve Chase, said all of the sex his client had was consensual and that he denies ever having sex while any of the men were unconscious. The alleged victims in the case met Courtney on a gay dating website or via a smart phone app and they expected to take drugs and have sex, Chase said. This case is so beyond the pale of the normal criminal case, Chase said. It is a different world that these men are in. Courtney has been charged with 41 counts of sodomy by force, sodomy of an unconscious person, continuous sexual assault and drugging his alleged victims. Because of a multiple victim enhancement to the charges, Courtney faces either 15 or 20 years to life in prison for each count, Wagstaffe said. Courtney is scheduled to appear in San Mateo County Superior Court in Redwood City on July 31 for the start of his jury trial. - Bay City News / Image via Shutterstock",1,4,0
839,"Laws to protect Californians from DUI offenders, help establish an earthquake early warning system, reform the California Public Utilities Commission, increase oversight of building contractors, require police to securely stow any handgun left in a car, improve tour bus safety, crack down on water-guzzling households, and more take effect on January 1. The new laws are the result of 17 bills that were introduced by Senator Jerry Hill, passed by the Legislature and signed by Governor Jerry Brown in 2016. Here are summaries of the bills that led to the new laws and what they do: Senate Bill 24 – JPA Pension Fix for San Mateo County Resolves a pension problem that prevented the cities of San Mateo, Belmont and Foster City from completing their Joint Powers Agreement for shared fire service. It allows the three cities to provide the JPA employees a defined benefit plan that those employees received as classic CalPERS members from their previous employment with the cities. San Mateo County Firefighters and the California Professional Firefighters supported SB 24, along with the cities of San Mateo, Belmont and Foster City. SB 62 – California Public Utilities Commission Office of the Safety Advocate Establishes the Office of the Safety Advocate within the California Public Utilities Commission to advocate for continuous, cost-effective improvement of safety management and safety performance of public utilities. SB 438 – Earthquake Early Warning Implementation Complements the $10 million included in the 2016-2017 budget for the statewide earthquake early warning system by establishing the Earthquake Early Warning Advisory Board within the Governors Office of Emergency Services. The new law brings California closer to statewide implementation of the earthquake early warning system. In emergencies, the alerts sent by the warning system will help prevent devastating and life-threatening missteps. Governor Browns announcement of his signing the bill is here and view video of the press conference held at the Office of Emergency Services headquarters here. SB 465 – Building Construction Contractors: Discipline, Reporting and Building Standards SB 465 is aimed at increasing oversight of contractors by closing the gaps in information that were revealed by the collapse of a balcony at a Berkeley apartment building on June 16, 2015. Ashley Donohoe, 22, of Rohnert Park, her cousin, Olivia Burke, 21, of Ireland, and four of their friends were killed. Seven other students from Ireland, including Aoife Beary who had been celebrating her 21st birthday, were hospitalized for weeks after the balcony gave way and sent them plummeting five stories to the ground. Aoife Beary, her mother Angela, Ashley Donohoes mother, Jackie, and representatives of the Irish Consulate testified to policy committees in the Capitol about the devastating loss felt by families from California to Ireland – and urged legislators to support SB 465, which was co-authored by Senator Loni Hancock, D-Oakland. The new law: SB 512 – Governance, Accountability and Transparency at the California Public Utilities Commission SB 512 reforms the governance structure of the California Public Utilities Commission by more clearly outlining the roles and responsibilities of commissioners and staff, and by requiring the CPUC to reach out to communities affected by CPUC decisions, instead of only to regulated utilities. To do so, SB 512 makes the following statutory changes: It 1) requires the commission to annually approve performance criteria for the commission and the executive director, and to annually evaluate the performance of the executive director based on those criteria; 2) requires the CPUC to reach out to those affected by its proceedings; 3) requires CPUC judges to adhere to ethics provisions of the Administrative Procedures Act; 4) allows the public to receive hearing transcripts at no charge; 5) permits the CPUC to meet in locations other than San Francisco; 6) requires the CPUC to modify its annual report to clarify how long the CPUC takes to finish rate or penalty cases; and 7) allows local governments to receive intervenor compensation when participating in CPUC efforts to improve safety, enabling local governments that have suffered catastrophes to seek such compensation. SB 661 – The Dig Safe Act of 2016 SB 661 addresses safety problems involving excavations and gas pipelines that are beneath soil or are otherwise underground by making clarifications to the so-called one-call law (Call 811 before you dig) and by creating the Safe Excavation Board, an appointed board of excavation stakeholders that is funded by fees on utilities. The board is to 1) investigate accidents and other one-call violations; 2) develop standards for safe excavation; and 3) coordinate education and outreach efforts. SB 812 – Improving Tour Bus Safety Improves the safety and oversight of tour buses operating in California by strengthening the California Highway Patrols tour bus inspection program. The law was prompted by a tour bus accident in San Franciscos Union Square in November 2015 that injured 20 people, at least five critically. After the crash, the CHP determined that the bus had never been inspected and was not registered with the California Public Utilities Commission, as is required by law. The CHP later conducted a surprise inspection of the companys bus fleet and found over 60 violations, 29 for mechanical problems. SB 814 – Cracking Down on Water-Guzzling Households During a Drought A winner of Senator Hills 2016 Oughta Be a Law…Or Not bill idea contest for constituents, SB 814 pulls the plug on excessive water use by households that flout mandatory reductions during drought emergencies. The law requires urban retail water suppliers to set rules for identifying and cracking down on households that consume enormous amounts of water despite restrictions imposed during a statewide declaration of a drought. The new law ensures that every urban retail water supplier has a tool to curb excessive water use by customers. Households that guzzle water – while neighbors and most other Californians abide by mandatory reductions – will no longer be able to hide and persist in their excess. SB 869 – Safe Storage of Police Handguns in Vehicles Another winner of Senator Hills 2016 Oughta Be a Law… contest, SB 869 responds to numerous thefts of handguns that law enforcement officers had left in cars. The stolen firearms included guns used in two murders in the Bay Area. SB 869 closes a legal loophole that had exempted law enforcement officers as well as concealed weapons permit holders from requirements to securely stow handguns in a lockbox out of plain view, or in the trunk, if the weapons are left in an unattended vehicle. SB 996 – Affordable Housing Property Tax Cap Aids local nonprofit and religious organizations that provide affordable housing by increasing the assessed property value exemption from $2,000,000 annually to $10,000,000 annually. The new law applies to three local nonprofits, such as the Saint Francis Center in Redwood City and the Ministry Services of the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul based in Los Altos Hills, which provides housing, food and clothing services to low-income families. SB 996 provides property tax relief to such organizations so that they can continue to provide more affordable housing for low income people and families. SB 1004 – Young Adult Offender Pilot Program Hailed by Governor Brown for its innovation, SB 1004 authorizes a pilot program in five counties, including Santa Clara, to give nonviolent young adult offenders between the ages of 18 and 21 the opportunity to take advantage of supportive and educational services in the juvenile justice system, rather than serve their time in an adult county jail. Although legally considered adults, these young offenders are still undergoing significant brain development, and may be better served by the juvenile justice system with age-appropriate, intensive services. Research shows that people do not develop adult-caliber, decision-making skills until their early 20s. Psychologists note that this maturity gap makes young adults more likely to engage in risk-seeking behavior. SB 1028 – Utility Wildfire Mitigation Plans SB 1028 requires 1) utilities regulated by the California Public Utilities Commission to file wildfire mitigation plans, 2) the CPUC to review those plans, and 3) publicly-owned utilities to also file wildfire mitigation plans with their governing boards. SB 1039 – Business and Professions Omnibus Bill SB 1039 makes several changes to the statutes governing various boards and bureaus under the Department of Consumer Affairs; includes specified fee increases for several boards including the Dental Hygiene Committee of California, the California Board of Optometry, the Board of Registered Nursing, the Board of Pharmacy, and the Contractors State License Board; and eliminates the Telephone Medical Advice Services Bureau. SB 1039 specifies that the continuing education standards established for nurses by the Board of Registered Nursing shall recognize specialized areas of practice, as previously required, and require that content be relevant to the practice of nursing, be related to the scientific knowledge or technical skills required for the practice of nursing, or be related to direct or indirect patient or client care. The legislation requires the nursing board to audit continuing education providers at least once every five years to ensure adherence to regulatory requirements. The new law also requires the board to withhold or rescind approval from any provider that is in violation of the regulatory requirements. SB 1046 – Ignition Interlock Devices for Drunk Driving Offenders Extends a pilot program requiring drunk driving offenders in Alameda, Los Angeles, Sacramento and Tulare counties to install the devices known as IIDs. IIDs are calibrated to the driver and prevent a car from starting if the driver is not sober. The four-county pilot would run until January 1, 2019, when the program would be expanded statewide with minor modifications so that: SB 1046 also creates an early incentive program, providing DUI offenders with full driving privileges soon after arrest if they install an IID. Their ultimate IID time requirement would be reduced based on when the early installation occurred. Low income offenders would be eligible for assistance to pay for an IID based on a sliding scale pegged to household income. SB 1192 – Private Post-Secondary Education SB 1192 changes the California Private Post-Secondary Education Act of 2009 to improve the effectiveness of the Bureau for Private Post-Secondary Education and opportunities for student success, and extends the BPPEs operations for four years. SB 1193 – Healing Arts, Board of Pharmacy, Veterinary Medical Board Sunset Bill SB 1193 makes changes to the Pharmacy Law, Veterinary Practice Act and Psychology Licensing Law to strengthen the laws and improve oversight of licensees by these boards. SB 1196 – Professions and Vocations: Bureau of Real Estate, Bureau of Real Estate Appraisers, and Bureau of Security and Investigative Services Bill SB 1196 ensures that the Bureau of Security and Investigative Services is subject to review by the appropriate policy committees of the Legislature. The legislation changes provisions in the Alarm Company Act, the Locksmith Act, the Private Investigator Act, the Private Security Services Act, Proprietary Security Services Act, and Collateral Recovery Act to improve the oversight, enforcement and regulation of licensees by the bureau. The bill also adds a sunset review date for the Bureau of Real Estate and the Bureau of Real Estate Appraisers, and changes existing laws to improve oversight, enforcement and regulation by the CalBRE and BREA. SB 1196 includes several consumer protection and public safety reforms to operations and oversight by the Bureau of Security and Investigative Services, which licenses about 380,000 companies and employees that provide alarm services, locksmith services, private investigation, private security, repossession services and firearm and baton training. The changes are intended to ensure that an applicant for licensure as an armed security guard is capable of exercising appropriate judgment, restraint and self-control; that armed security guards are qualified for their jobs, and that California regulators step up their policing of the industry. SB 1196 also imposes stricter training standards and requirements to ensure that shootings and incidents of suspected excessive force are investigated. In addition, the new law enables gun permits to be revoked when warranted and improves oversight of companies. – SUBMITTED FOR PUBLICATION BY: Office of State Senator Jerry Hill / Image via Shutterstock",0,8,5
840,"A San Francisco police officer known as the Hot Cop of the Castro pleaded not guilty today to two felony hit-and-run charges after he allegedly struck two pedestrians in a crosswalk in the citys North Beach neighborhood early Sunday and then fled the scene on foot. Police Officer Christopher Kohrs, 38, a seven-year veteran of the department who is currently out of custody on $100,000 bail, entered the Hall of Justice for his arraignment in San Francisco Superior Court this afternoon. Met by a barrage of media, San Francisco sheriffs deputies at the Hall of Justice ushered Kohrs into a backroom until Judge Edward Torpoco was ready to arraign him. Kohrs had previously gained social media fame as the Hot Cop of the Castro, stemming from his time patrolling the Castro District and participating in events such as the San Francisco AIDS Foundations Big Gay 10K race. Kohrs is accused of striking two men in their 40s around 2:20 a.m. Sunday at Broadway and Montgomery Street and then fleeing the scene on foot. The two men were hospitalized with very severe internal injuries, San Francisco District Attorney George Gascon said this afternoon. Police said the injuries are considered serious but not life-threatening. Kohrs was identified as the registered owner and driver of the orange and black 2009 Dodge Charger involved in the collision and left at the scene. Roughly eight hours after the collision, at about 10 a.m. Sunday, Kohrs turned himself in at police headquarters, according to the district attorneys office. Police said they are investigating whether Kohrs was driving while intoxicated. Judge Torpoco asked Assistant District Attorney Stephanie Zudekoff whether there were allegations that Kohrs was driving under the influence when the collision occurred, but Zudekoff said that such allegations are not included in the current complaint. Gascon said earlier this week that the lack of sobriety testing immediately after the collision could cause problems for prosecutors handling the case. Zudekoff urged the judge to prohibit Kohrs from driving, but Kohrs attorney Anthony Tall argued that his client would need to drive in order to attend meetings with the internal affairs unit at the Police Department. Torpoco ordered that Kohrs only drive to and from work-related meetings. Kohrs is currently on unrelated medical leave and if he becomes eligible to return to duty, he will then be suspended pending further investigation, according to police. Gascon said Kohrs actually had the green light when the collision occurred and that the people he hit were crossing the street against a red light. He said what makes this incident very disturbing is that a police officer left the scene of a collision. He didnt make himself available for drug and alcohol testing until almost eight hours later, Gascon said. Gascon said, hypothetically speaking, it makes it more difficult, but its not impossible to prosecute someone for intoxication-related charges in similar cases. Gascon was unable to comment on toxicology and forensic evidence collected by investigators. He said the officers conduct was egregious and that his office will be very aggressive in the prosecution of this case. He said when law enforcement officers, who are sworn to protect and serve the public, break the law, It makes a mockery of the whole system. Kohrs next court date, a pre-hearing conference, is set for Jan. 26. --Bay City News",0,8,5
841,"A 21-year-old man who allegedly repeatedly stabbed his two adoptive fathers at their home in Sherman Oaks pleaded not guilty Thursday. Matthew Boulet is charged with two counts of attempted murder and one count of aggravated mayhem stemming from the attack early July 24 in the 4600 block of Burnet Avenue. The charges include allegations that Boulet used a knife in the commission of the attack and inflicted great bodily injury on the two victims. Boulet allegedly stabbed one of his adoptive fathers multiple times in the neck, body, face, arms and ears, and stabbed his other adoptive father multiple times in the face, arms and body when that man tried to intervene, according to prosecutors. A pocket knife was recovered. Boulet was arrested early that morning by Los Angeles police. Neighbors identified the victims as Tom Boulet and Ken Coll, an openly gay couple who adopted Matthew Boulet when he was a boy. Tom and Ken have been very significant on our block, great role models of parenthood, neighbor Florence Riggs told ABC7. She said she had no idea what may have prompted the attack, but said she hoped its all going to be rectified in some way where everyone will heal. Authorities said the suspect was apparently home from college for the summer when the stabbing occurred. He is due back in a Van Nuys courtroom Sept. 26, when a date is scheduled to be set for a hearing to determine if there is enough evidence to require him to stand trial. If convicted as charged, Matthew Boulet could face a maximum sentence of life in prison. City News Service; Photo: Shutterstock",0,8,5

844,"Former Miami Dolphins player and Harvard-Westlake School alum Jonathan Martin pleaded not guilty Tuesday to criminal threats charges stemming from an Instagram post that led to a daylong shut down of the exclusive Studio City campus. Jonathan Martin, 28, is facing four felony counts of criminal threats and a misdemeanor count of possessing a loaded firearm. He is due back in court in Van Nuys April 25, when a date will be set for a hearing to determine if there is enough evidence for him to stand trial. Martin faces up to six years behind bars if convicted as charged, according to the District Attorneys Office. On Feb. 23, officials with Harvard-Westlake sent an early morning message via the schools emergency alert notification system advising students to stay home, apologizing for the short notice and citing student safety as the schools highest priority. According to online images of the Instagram message, Martin posted a photo of a shotgun with a several shotgun shells, emblazoned with the hashtags #HarvardWestlake and #MiamiDolphins. The text of the post read, When youre a bully victim & a coward, your options are suicide, or revenge. Martin, who retired in 2015, was at the center of an NFL bullying scandal during his playing days and claimed during that investigation that he had also been bullied at Harvard-Westlake. RELATED: Ex-NFLer Jonathan Martin Charged For Threat To Harvard-Westlake The Instagram post tagged former Dolphins teammates Richie Incognito and Mike Pouncey and a pair of former Harvard-Westlake classmates. Incognito was suspended by the Dolphins in 2013 in response to allegations of bullying and harassment -- some of it alleged to be racial in nature -- targeting Martin. Pouncey was also implicated in the scandal that led to extensive investigations by the NFL and the Dolphins. Incognito did not play the entire 2014 season, but later signed with the Buffalo Bills, where he still plays. Law enforcement sources told the Los Angeles Times that Martin was detained and briefly hospitalized at a mental health facility after the Instagram post came to light, and he was found with a loaded weapon in a car in Glendale. Detectives searched his home and found other weapons, an ax and a large knife, The Times reported.

845,"A judge dismissed a lawsuit by a gay former Los Angeles police officer who alleged she was forced to retire after about 30 years on the job because of discriminatory and retaliatory conduct by her superiors. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Deirdre Hill heard arguments on the citys motion to toss Sue Herolds lawsuit on Friday morning. She took the case under submission and granted the motion later in the day. Lawyers for the city argued that Herold, who joined the LAPD in 1984, could not prove that her sexual orientation played any role in disciplinary actions her bosses took against her. Among the accusations against Herold was that she was involved in vandalism of a desk and that she improperly accessed DMV records of one of her ex-girlfriends. The defense attorneys also said that Herolds commanding officers were unaware she participated in a previous lawsuit in 1987 against the city and that the prior legal action did not influence them in their discipline. In the earlier case, Herold was a co-plaintiff with former Sgt. Mitchell Grobeson, the LAPDs first openly gay officer. Herolds involvement in the Grobeson case caused her to be identified and recognized as an outspoken defender of the rights of gay LAPD officers, according to Herolds attorneys court papers. — City News Service, photo via Shutterstock",1,4,3
846,"A female member of the Los Angeles police bomb squad is suing the city, alleging the bosses did little when she complained that a male colleague stalked and harassed her even though he knew she was gay. Stefanie Alcocers Los Angeles Superior Court lawsuit, filed Monday, states that Officer Harry Lathrop told her that he was madly in love with her for six years and that he intended to leave his wife because of his deep love for her. Alcocer alleges she was forced to work in a hostile work environment and subjected to retaliation because she is gay and due to the fact she spoke out against inappropriate behavior on the job. She seeks unspecified damages. A representative for the City Attorneys Office did not immediately return a call for comment. According to the complaint, Alcocer joined the LAPD in September 1996 and was one of 40 candidates in 2008 vying to be a bomb technician. She was selected and was the only female bomb technician in her unit, the suit states. Lathrop, also a bomb technician, first made his alleged verbal advances toward Alcocer last April, the suit states. She responded that she did not have any romantic feelings toward him and that a relationship was never going to happen, the suit states. (Alcocer) told Lathrop to leave her alone and give her space, the suit states. However, on a daily basis thereafter, Lathrop stalked Alcocer, showing up at restaurants where she ate, drove by her work detail even when he was assigned elsewhere, sent her emails and text messages and bombarded her with telephone calls, the suit states. On one occasion, Lathrop cornered Alcocer in an LAPD parking lot and punched an LAPD truck when she refused to speak to him, according to her complaint. Last May, Alcocer and her domestic partner, who also is an LAPD officer, went to Washington, D.C. to attend an event honoring and raising money for the families of slain police officers, the suit states. Lathrop also attended and was registered at a different hotel than Alcocer and her partner, but he still showed up in the lobby of where the plaintiff was staying and asked her partner to speak with him, the suit states. Lathrops request was denied, the suit states. When Alcocer went to a Starbucks near her hotel, Lathrop walked up and asked, What about us?, the suit states. Alcocer replied, There is no us, the suit states. Alcocer complained about Lathrops alleged misconduct to supervisors during the next several months, concerned that Lathrop had access to the bomb squad explosives bunker, the suit states. But after she presented her case to Internal Affairs in September, nothing was done and Lathrop remained in the bomb squad, the suit states. The next month, Capt. Cathy Meek, the commanding officer of the bomb squad, told Alcocer that her complaints about Lathrop did not rise to the level of misconduct and declined to begin a personnel complaint against him, the suit states. Lathrop was removed from the bomb squad on Dec. 26, but Meek ordered that his equipment was not to be reassigned and that it was being stored for him, the suit states. He also was allowed to keep his city car and phone, according to the complaint. City News Service",1,2,0
847,"- Authorities announced a series of actions Tuesday in a crackdown against property owners and associates of a white supremacist gang allegedly involved with two San Fernando Valley homes. The homes in Canoga Park and Granada Hills have served as bases of operations for members of the San Fernando Valley Peckerwoods gang, according to Los Angeles City Attorney Mike Feuer. Authorities say the homes have been the sites of rampant criminal activity, including illegal gun and drug sales, as well as places to make pipe bombs, store stolen property, and recruit and train associates in counterfeit and identity theft. Feuer said he has filed lawsuits that ask the owners of the properties, both of whom live at the single-family homes, to change the conditions radically at those properties or to have them shut down. And those changes involve, in short, assuring that individuals who are a threat to the neighborhood are not allowed to be on that property and asuring other strategies that have been employed at properties like these not be permitted there. Were fighting to prevent white supremacist gangs from threatening our neighborhoods with their toxic brew of violence, crime and hate, Feuer said. My office will continue to take every step we can to combat them -- and all that they stand for. Feuer has filed an abatement lawsuit against Johnny Reed, an alleged member of the gang and a shot-caller for the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang, who lives at a single-family residence at 16440 Index St. in Granada Hills. Also named as defendants are Monica Lewis, the owner of the property, as well as her two adult sons, Norman and Robert Lewis. The property is located within 1,000 feet of John. F. Kennedy High School and Jane Addams High School and has a reputation in the community and among law enforcement as an alleged hub for white supremacist gang members and distribution of methamphetamine and heroin, Feuer said. Feuer also filed a lawsuit against Erik Cutshaw, whom he called a known associate of the SFV Peckerwoods gang, and who lives at a single-family residence at 7244 Loma Verde Ave. in Canoga Park. Also named as a defendant is his brother, Kenneth Cutshaw, the owner of the property. The property is 500 feet away from the Canoga Park Branch Library. Erik Cutshaw has been arrested at least three times since 2012 in connection with criminal activity at the property, Feuers office said. A third location, 7756 Farralone in Canoga Park, was informally abated by Feuer after Erik Cutshaw was arrested for allegedly planting a pipe bomb under a vehicle parked outside the property, a residence of a rival gang member. The bomb exploded at that location, which is directly across the street from Columbus Middle School. The City Attorney has successfully worked to cease the gang and nuisance activity at the 7756 Farralone property and it is not the subject of any of the lawsuits, a statement from Feuers office said. All occupants have been evicted, and the property is currently listed for sale. The filed lawsuits involving the 16440 Index property in Granada Hills and the 7244 Loma Verde property in Canoga Park seek an injunction prohibiting gang and criminal activity on each property, removal of any fortifications and structures that inhibit the service of search warrants, and prohibiting the installation of surveillance cameras, among other safety provisions. The injunctions would also prohibit any members or known associates of the gang in question or any other criminal gang, from accessing the properties at any time. Feuer displayed photos at Tuesdays news conference taken from inside the Farralone property that included swastikas painted on the walls, a confederate flag, knives and drug paraphernalia. While none of the arrests at the properties were directly tied to hate crimes, Feuer said, You can tell that our office believes very strongly, and I believe very strongly, that we need to be especially protective of people, especially now. There is no question that we are living in a nation of heightened tension. He added that his office is going to be vigilant in counteracting every inch, every moment when someone feels jeopardized is a moment that we need to reach out in assuring that they will be protected. Feuer also recently established an online method through which residents may report properties with gang and/or narcotics activity in their neighborhoods. Residents may report these properties by calling Feuers office at (213) 978-8340, or by visiting www.lacityattorney.org. All reports may be made anonymously. City News Service",1,0,0
848,"- Law enforcement authorities and Muslim community leaders Monday condemned a series of letters sent to area mosques denouncing Muslims and warning of a pending cleansing of America under President Donald Trump, and local officials urged anyone who receives such a letter to come forward. I would encourage you, the community, that if you receive letters like this, please report them, said Stephen Woolery, FBI special agent in charge of the bureaus Counterterrorism Division in Los Angeles. Because we know that there is under-reporting in a number of crimes that occur. We encourage you to report these things so we can get to the bottom of it and we can keep the community safe. Joined by officials from the Los Angeles Police Department, Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department. Los Angeles School Police and Muslim community organizations, Woolery said the letters contained awful, awful language against Muslims, but did not contain any specific threat. Officials with the Council on American-Islamic Relations chapters in Anaheim and the San Francisco Bay Area reported that the mosques received a hand-written letter calling Muslims vile and filthy people, and telling them to pack your bags and get out of Dodge. The letters said President-elect Donald Trump would cleanse America and make it shine again. And, hes going to start with you Muslims. The letters were addressed to Children of Satan, and warned that Trump was going to do to you Muslims what Hitler did to the Jews. Woolery said the letters were delivered to the Islamic Center of Southern California in Los Angeles, along with mosques in Signal Hill, Northridge, Claremont and San Jose. He also said a similar letter was sent to a mosque in Georgia. The letters that were seeing, they all look similar in language, he said. I dont want to be too absolute but they look like they come from the same author. Los Angeles Police Department Deputy Chief Michael Downing said the letters sent to the Islamic Center of Southern California and the mosque in Northridge were postmarked Nov. 19. Were asking all communities -- if youve received letters like this to make sure you report those, Downing said at the news conference at the Islamic Center of Southern California. Hateful rhetoric creates fear among so many communities, and I think its also caused by people who are fearful of communities that are different from themselves, Downing said. ... The real message here is we are all Americans. This is our home, whether youre Christian, Muslim or Jew. Salam Al-Marayati, president of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, said he and other community leaders want to reassure people who are targets of hateful language or bullying that they are not alone. We will meet this kind of hate with force, he said. Let me just speak directly to the person who wrote these letters to the mosques: You are a coward -- unless you come here and debate the points that you apparently believe so much in. So let us bring this darkness that you are in to light, and let us discuss these issues directly ... Al-Marayati pointed to anti-Muslim sentiment among a fringe element of America that includes conspiracy theories about Muslims and Islam. The more you repeat a lie, the more it becomes fact, he said. So let us debate these issues out in the open. -- City News Service, photo courtesy of CAIR",1,3,3
849,"- The Los Angeles Police Commission Tuesday requested a re-examination of the way the LAPD handles complaints of racial profiling by officers, with one member saying the existing efforts are inadequate. Community members arent convinced that we take bias seriously, said Commissioner Cynthia McClain-Hill. And I dont really believe that anyone sitting in this room believes that our data captures the full extent of inappropriate or biased encounters. McClain-Hill called for a deeper look at the LAPDs biased policing complaint procedures and the departments efforts to train officers about bias, including the unconscious or implicit kind. She noted that during the entire time the LAPD has been receiving and reviewing complaints of biased policing, the number of sustained complaints, particularly with respect to racial bias, has been at or near zero. Critics of the police department have expressed incredulity that virtually every complaint made by the public about racial profiling by LAPD officers has been deemed unfounded, as has been indicated in the departments periodic audits and reports on such complaints. The commission adopted McClain-Hills motion, which calls for LAPD officials to report back on the issue on Nov. 1, at a meeting to be held in the community. Her motion specifically requests that LAPD officials report on the biased policing complaint policies of other large cities, including Philadelphia, New York, Chicago, Dallas and Baltimore. She asked that officials find out how those municipalities define biased policing or racial profiling, as well as data on the number of complaints and the demographics of the cities and their respective departments. McClai-Hill also asked for more details on how the LAPD tries to identify any bias that a candidate may have during the recruitment process, and how anti-bias training is provided to officers and what supervisors are doing to ensure that officers are not engaging in biased actions. She also requested an update on how and when the department will roll out its planned implicit bias training. My goal here is to get us beyond the limitations, which seem obvious, of relying on a single metric -- that is to say just the numbers captured in biased policing complaint reports presented periodically to the commission, McClain-Hill said. She added that she hopes the report will promote a real and meaningful dialogue that can serve as the basis for real and meaningful policymaking, and does not want her motion to be interpreted as suggesting that she believes members of this department at large are inherently biased, or show up to work for any reason other than to do the very best job they can (in) protecting this city. --City News Service.

850,"Police have arrested a man accused entering a beauty salon, grabbing a hair stylist, dragging her to the rear of the business and sexually assaulting her. The brutal attack was caught on tape. The attack occurred about 7 p.m. Tuesday in the 14500 block of Vanowen Street, according to Los Angeles police Officer Anna Vardanian. The victim was alone in the store at the time of the assault when the suspect sexually assaulted her inside the store and ran away in an incident caught on video, authorities said. The assault occurred at Vanessas Beauty & Barber shop, where the woman was employed as a hair stylist, police said. Police said the suspect entered the salon and waited while the victim finished with a client. When the client left, the suspect dragged the victim to the back of the business, where he raped her. We need to get this predator off the streets and we need to do that as soon as possible, LAPD Lt. Jim Gavin said before the arrest. I would hate to think that we have other victims or potential victims out there. Gavin added, In my 28 years, Ill never forget this. This was shocking. I had never imagined I would witness something like that based on video. Although the suspect has not been identified, it previously was revealed he may go by the name Enrique. He was said to be about 30 years old, 6 feet tall and about 180 pounds. Anyone with information about the attack was asked to call Vardanian of the Sexual Assault Detail at (818) 374-0008 or 911.

851,"VAN NUYS, CA- Police hope surveillance video circulated today will flush out a man who entered a Van Nuys beauty salon, grabbed a hair stylist, dragged her to the rear of the business and sexually assaulted her. The attack occurred about 7 p.m. Tuesday in the 14500 block of Vanowen Street, according to Los Angeles police Officer Anna Vardanian. The victim was alone in the store at the time of the assault, Vardanian said. The man sexually assaulted the woman inside the store, then ran away, according to Vardanian. The victim was upset and shook up but she is better now, Vardanian said today. The assault occurred at Vanessas Beauty & Barber shop, where the woman was employed as a hair stylist. Police said the suspect entered the salon and waited while the victim finished with a client. When the client left, the suspect dragged the victim to the back of the business, where he choked and beat her, ripped off her clothes and raped her, in an ordeal that lasted about a half hour and was captured on surveillance video. We need to get this predator off the streets and we need to do that as soon as possible, LAPD Lt. Jim Gavin told NBC4. I would hate to think that we have other victims or potential victims out there. Gavin added, In my 28 years, Ill never forget this. This was shocking. I had never imagined I would witness something like that based on video. The police investigation has determined that the suspect may go by the name of Enrique. He is about 30 years old, about 6 feet tall and weighs 180 pounds. He has crew-cut dark brown hair and brown eyes, and was wearing a green jacket and blue pants. Anyone with information about the attack was asked to call Vardanian of the Sexual Assault Detail at (818) 374-0008 or 911.

852,"Nearly a dozen anti-Muslim/Middle Easterner hate crimes were reported in Los Angeles County in November and December, compared with one such crime during the comparable period in 2014, it was announced today. The analysis was conducted by the Los Angeles County Commission on Human Relations in the wake of the terror attacks that occurred in Paris in November and San Bernardino in December. Among the 11 incidents recorded: On Dec. 15, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors unanimously passed a motion to condemn the Dec. 2 attack that killed 14 people at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino, to recognize that no religion or race or ethnicity is responsible for these acts, and that fear-based stereotyping and scapegoating creates an atmosphere conducive to Islamophobia, xenophobia, discrimination, hate and bigotry. The motion directed county agencies to increase outreach and assistance to the targeted vulnerable communities. Last month, the Los Angeles Countywide Criminal Justice Coordination Committee established a task force to promote stronger relations and cooperation among police agencies and affected communities, and to more effectively prepare for any future incident that could result in a spike in hate crimes.

853,"Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton discussed her commitment to the middle class at three Los Angeles-area fundraisers today amid criticism from both the Republican National Committee and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. The fundraisers were closed to reporters, like most fundraisers for presidential candidates. An aide who asked not to be identified said Clinton discussed her commitment to build on the progress made under President Barack Obama, her fights to break down the barriers holding people back, including any American who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism, sexism and discrimination against the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. The Republican National Committee released a web video of comments made in 2008 by Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, critical of Obama, who she was running against for the Democratic presidential nomination, and slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. The video ends with a picture of the Clintons accompanied by the words, The Clintons: Only with you, when they need you. A tweet from campaign account of Sanders, who is running against Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, noted its been 17 days, 16 hours and 32 minutes since @HillaryClinton said she would look into releasing her paid speeches to Wall Street. There was no immediate response from the Clinton campaign to the video and tweet. Clinton began her seventh visit to Southern California since declaring her candidacy with a $1,000 per-person fundraiser at the Studio City home of Elizabeth Hirsh Naftali where individuals donating $2,700 had a photo taken with Clinton. Individuals raising $10,000 or couples contributing $5,400 to Clintons primary campaign had photos taken with the former first lady and became members of the Hillary for America Finance Committee, according to an invitation obtained by City News Service. The maximum individual contribution under federal law for a candidate seeking a partys presidential nomination is $2,700. The 68-year-old Clinton then attended a $2,700-per-person fundraiser at the SLS Hotel on Los Angeles-Beverly Hills border. Clintons final event was an evening reception in Hancock Park. Individuals raising $10,000 were co-hosts of the event and had a photo taken with Clinton. Individuals raising $27,000 had photos taken with Clinton, received a ticket to a host reception and became members of the Hillary for America Finance Committee. The fundraiser was held at the home of Jon Vein, the chief strategy officer and a co-founder of MarketShare, which describes itself as the worlds leading analytics technology provider for major brand marketers, and his wife, Ellen Goldsmith-Vein, a movie producer. Approximately 320 people attended the Studio City fundraiser while the SLS Hotel event drew approximately 175 people. Mayor Eric Garcetti was among the approximately 300 people at the Hancock Park event. The Southland fundraisers are part of a two-day California fundraising swing for Clinton, which began Sunday with three events in Northern California, according to the website politicalpartytime.org, which tracks political fundraisers. Clinton held 17 fundraisers during her previous visits to the Southland since declaring her candidacy on April 12. Clinton also participated in a roundtable discussion with a group of home care providers, appeared on the ABC late-night talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live and helped introduce the Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders for Hillary initiative in her past Southland visits during this campaign cycle.

854,"A transient pleaded no contest today to attacking and hurling racial epithets at an Hispanic postal worker as she was delivering mail in North Hollywood. Charles Thomas Miller, 61, pleaded to one count each of battery and misdemeanor criminal threats. He was immediately sentenced to time served and four years probation. The original criminal complaint included a charge of assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury. That charge was dismissed Oct. 5, following a preliminary hearing of the evidence. Miller, who has a 1978 conviction for robbery, was arrested Sept. 19 and released at midday today.

855,"The FBI has identified the man who was found dead in a burning vehicle that had crashed through a gate at Travis Air Force Base Wednesday evening as Sausalito resident Hafiz Kazi, 51, a native of India. Kazi had been living in the United States since 1993 most often in the San Francisco Bay Area, Special Agent in Charge of the FBIs Sacramento Office Sean Ragan said at an afternoon news conference in Roseville. He was a legal permanent resident of the United States, Ragan said. Kazi was driving a minivan containing five propane tanks, a gym bag, three phones, three plastic-one-gallon gas containers and several lighters, Ragan said. The van drove through the main gate at Travis Air Force in Fairfield without authorization around 7 p.m. Wednesday, crashed and caught fire before first responders could get to it. Initially it was believed the van driver had an accident and drove through the gate, Ragan said. Kazi was the only one inside and he was identified by fingerprints, Ragan said. The FBI notified a relative in India of Kazis death, Ragan said. There is no evidence of a religious motive for the intrusion at the base or a link to terrorism at this time, Ragan said. Investigators have identified some associates of Kazi through social media, email and phones, and the agency is looking for other associates and friends. The FBI also is working on some search warrants, Ragan said. There were no known threats to the air base or Solano County, Ragan said. A video was found on Kazis phone but it did not appear related to a possible motive for the bombing, Ragan said. We are trying to piece together his life and what led him to this event, Ragan said. A significant investigation of the incident is ongoing, and Kazis autopsy was underway Friday afternoon, Ragan said.

857,"-Police say they have arrested a Fairfield man in connection with three firebombings Thursday night and early Friday morning. Matthew Scott Jones, 39, is suspected of throwing an incendiary device through a window of an apartment in the 2900 block of North Texas Street around 10 p.m. on April 27. Two people were in the apartment at the time, and police said that Jones, their neighbor, used racial epithets toward them and had been acting erratically over the past month. Police extinguished the apartment fire and the victims were not injured. Police also responded to a car fire on Thomas Court at 11 p.m. Thursday. The fire was similar to the incident at the apartment an hour earlier, police said. Officers responded to a fire and explosion in front of the police station at 1000 Webster St. at 1 a.m. Friday. Witness descriptions of the suspect in the two earlier incidents and video of the suspect committing the firebombing in front of the police station led to the identity of Jones as the suspect, police said. Police located Jones driving his car around 1:40 a.m. in the 2900 block of North Texas Street near the apartment fire incident. Then around 12:06 p.m. Friday police said that a bomb squad was en route to the 2400 block of Crocker Circle, where businesses were evacuated after a similar incendiary device was located near chemicals that could have posed a threat if ignited. That device was rendered safe around 1:25 p.m., police say. Jones was arrested without further incident, and he was booked in the Solano County Jail for attempted murder, committing a hate crime, possessing a destructive device, possessing a destructive device with intent to injure, exploding a destructive device with intent to commit murder and arson. There are no other suspects in the incidents, police say.

858,"A federal judge in Oakland agreed today to release on $500,000 bond the widow of a man who shot and killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Florida last year. U.S. Magistrate Judge Donna Ryu said federal prosecutors failed to convince her that Noor Salman, 30, is a flight risk or a threat to the community. However, Ryu granted prosecutors a 48-hour stay so that they can appeal her ruling to the Middle District Court of Florida, which has jurisdiction in the case. The Florida court has the right to come to a different decision, Ryu said. That means the earliest that Salman could be released to the custody of her uncle, Abdallah Salman, who lives in Rodeo, is 11 a.m. on Friday. Ryu said Noor Salmans bond is secured by the $500,000 in equity that her uncle has in his house plus the $525,000 in equity that her mother, Ekbal Salman, has in her house, which also is in Rodeo. Salman, who was dressed in a red jail jumpsuit and wore her hair in braids at her packed hearing today, is accused of aiding and abetting her husband, Omar Mateen, in providing support to a foreign terrorist organization, namely, the Islamic State, in the attack at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando on June 12. Salman is also accused of obstructing justice by misleading local police and the FBI when she was questioned in the hours following the attack. Along with the 49 killed, 53 other people were injured in the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. Mateen died in a shootout with police. Salman was arrested in January at her mothers house in Rodeo, where she and her 4-year-old son had been living since September. Ryu said she believes the weight of the governments evidence against Salman is debatable at this time.Prosecutor Sara Sweeney alleged at a previous hearing that at the end of 16 hours of interrogation by FBI agents that began on June 12, Salman admitted she was aware that her husband left their home on June 11 with a rifle and a backpack full of ammunition and allegedly said she knew he was going to commit an attack. Sweeney also alleged that Salman was aware that Mateen was watching a Islamic State recruiting video, accompanied him on three trips to case possible shooting sites and was with him when he bought ammunition. But Ryu said what Sweeney described as Salmans alleged admissions were made at the end of a lengthy interrogation at which she wasnt represented by a lawyer and those statements might not be admissible in a trial. Ryu also said Salmans attorneys have argued that Salman was the victim of domestic abuse and a psychological evaluation shows that she suffers from cognitive deterioration that impairs her abstract thinking. Orlando Police Chief John Mina said in a statement that hes disappointed that Ryu plans to release Salman on bond. Mina said, Nothing can ease the pain we all feel about the senseless and brutal murders of 49 of our neighbors, friends, family members and loved ones. Mina added, But I have full faith that she will ultimately be brought to justice and I remain grateful to federal authorities who worked tirelessly on this case for months to see that some measure of justice be served in this act of terror that has affected our community so deeply. Charles Swift, one of Salmans lawyers, said Ryus ruling is a just, equitable decision that allows her to be reunited with her family. Another defense attorney, Linda Moreno, said shes glad that Ryu is allowing Salman to be released on bond, saying, Its extremely rare for so-called terrorists to be released on bond. Moreno said she believes Ryus decision is a statement on the weakness of the governments case against Salman. Moreno said Salman wants to be home and see her 4-year-old son. Swift said court officials decided it would be better that Salman be housed with her uncle at his Rodeo home instead of with her mother because her uncle speaks better English and has been the family member who has been communicating with federal authorities. Ryu said Salman has strong family support and has no prior criminal record. She is one of four daughters in a family of Palestinian descent, was born in the U.S. and primarily grew up in the East Bay. Salmans lawyers said that after she was divorced from her abusive first husband, she met Mateen on an online dating site and moved with him to Fort Pierce, Florida, when they married. If the Florida court doesnt reverse her ruling, Ryu said Salman will essentially be under house arrest for now because she wont be allowed to leave her uncles house except for when she meets with her lawyers or has to go to court and will have to wear a GPS monitor. Ryu also said Salman must participate in mental health treatment and cant renew her passport, which has expired. Ryu scheduled a status conference hearing for Salman for March 9 in Oakland. --Bay City News/Pulse shooting scene image via Orlando police",1,4,0
859,"The names of fallen Palm Springs police officers Jose Gil Vega and Lesley Zerebny were added Monday to the states peace officer memorial monument during a ceremony at the state Capitol. Vega and Zerebny were among 13 other officers memorialized during the 41st annual California Peace Officers Memorial Ceremony in Sacramento. The California Peace Officers Memorial Monument, which is on the Capitol grounds, includes the names of more than 1,500 fallen police officers who have been killed in the line of duty. Along with Vega and Zerebny, eight other officers who were killed in the line of duty last year were memorialized, as were five who died in previous years. Palm Springs police Chief Bryan Reyes was the keynote speaker at the ceremony, which also included a memorial procession of law enforcement vehicles and a Walk of Honor for the families of fallen officers. During an impassioned speech, Reyes decried state legislation that he believes put officers lives at risk. Though he did not specifically name Proposition 47 or Assembly Bill 109, which redefined punishments for non-violent offenders in a bid to reduce prison overcrowding, Reyes said the officers deaths put into focus the Assembly bills and propositions responsible for the watering down of our justice system -- a comment that drew sustained applause from the crowd. The further that society drifts from the truth, the more it will hate those that speak it. If I am hated, it just shows how much we have drifted, Reyes said. He praised the family members of officers for their support of their loved ones. Know they went to work that fatal day loving what they do because of the support of you, he told family members attending the ceremony. Know that theres always someone within our law enforcement profession to lean on during your time in need. Vega, 63, and Zerebny, 27, were killed last Oct. 8 after responding to a family disturbance call. John Hernandez Felix, 26, allegedly fired on the officers through the metal screen door of his home, striking Vega, Zerebny, and a third officer who survived his injuries. Their deaths marked the first time a Palm Springs police officer had been killed in the line of duty since Jan. 1, 1962, when Officer Lyle Wayne Larrabee died during a vehicle pursuit. The only other death in the department was that of Officer Gale Gene Eldridge, who was fatally shot on Jan. 18, 1961, while investigating an armed robbery. Vega had been with the department for 35 years -- five years past his retirement eligibility -- and had planned to finish his career last December. Zerebny had been with the department for about 18 months and had just returned to duty from maternity leave after the birth of a daughter. – By City News Service / Images credit: PSPD",0,8,5
860,"Union City Police Chief Darryl McAllister confirmed in an open letter to the community on Wednesday that his son, 18-year-old Tyrone Keith McAllister, was arrested for the brutal attack of a 71-year-old Sikh man in Manteca in the Central Valley. Chief McAllister said he is disgusted by the attack and revealed that his son has been estranged from our family and our home for several months now. The Chief reported that it pained him to discuss such a private matter, but felt the need to be transparent with the community. The attack was caught on video. Chief McAllister gives this description of the attack, The two men confronted the man, apparently in an attempt to rob him, but when the elder did not cooperate, one of the men violently kicked the man in the chest, catapulting him to the ground, and then kicked him again several times as he lay defenseless on the pavement. Words can barely describe how embarrassed, dejected, and hurt my wife, daughters, and I feel right now, the Chief continued in his open letter. Violence and hatred is not what we have taught our children; intolerance for others is not even in our vocabulary, let alone our values. Crime has never been an element of our household, our values, nor the character to which we hold ourselves. (Get Patch real-time email alerts for the latest news from your California neighborhood.

The incident was initially investigated as an attempted robbery, but now detectives are looking into whether the assault meets the legal requirements to be charged as a hate crime, according to Manteca police. Tyrone McAllister has been arrested on suspicion of attempted robbery, elder abuse and assault with a deadly weapon. Another suspect identified only as a 16-year-old juvenile was also arrested. Its difficult for us to comprehend how one of three kids who grew up with the same parents, under the same roof, with the same rules and same values and character could wander so far astray.

865,"LOS ANGELES, CA- The city of Los Angeles will pay $50,000 to resolve civil rights claims made by a Los Angeles police detective who lost his job after making racially charged remarks during a training session, the city attorneys office said today. Frank Lyga filed a federal lawsuit last summer, alleging he was discriminated against because he is a white police officer who was wrongfully perceived to be racist. Lyga alleged that his civil rights were violated when LAPD officials wrongfully decided to fire him because of his race, and that the citys action was motivated by political pressure from the African American community. The final settlement agreement signed today by the citys attorney does not include reinstatement of employment to the LAPD, which Lyga had also been seeking. Lyga, who worked for the LAPD for 28 years, said in his lawsuit that he decided to retire early rather than be fired. The settlement did not require the approval of the City Council, which only considers claim amounts of more than $100,000, according to Rob Wilcox, spokesman for the City Attorneys Office. Lyga drew headlines in 2014 after an audio recording surfaced of remarks he made during a question-and-answer session of a November 2013 training seminar about search warrants. He delivered an expletive-laden rant, calling a prominent black civil rights attorney an ewok, saying a female LAPD captain had been swapped around a bunch of times and describing a lieutenant as a moron. Lyga also allegedly discussed his fatal 1997 shooting of a fellow officer, Kevin Gaines. Gaines was off-duty and was involved in a traffic dispute with Lyga, who was working undercover at the time. The incident sparked tensions within the LAPD because Lyga is white and Gaines was black. At the end of his lecture, Lyga recalled a confrontation with Carl Douglas, the attorney representing Gaines family and the same man Lyga called an ewok. Douglas asked Lyga if he had any regrets about the shooting. He replied, No, I regret he was alone in the truck at the time... I could have killed a whole truckload of them and I would have been happy doing it. After the secretly recorded audio surfaced, Lyga admitted some of his remarks were inappropriate and apologized. But an LAPD disciplinary panel recommended that police Chief Chief Charlie Beck fire Lyga, saying that although he had not been accused of racism, his speech had an underlying racial tone. In his lawsuit, Lyga alleged he was told in another letter that he posed a significant liability to the LAPD, particularly if he were involved in another shooting of someone who was black.

866,"By ELIZABETH HSING-HUEI CHOU Los Angeles -- As Black Lives Matter activists entered an eighth day of a sit-in outside Los Angeles City Hall, police Chief Charlie Beck lamented today that local activists have not been interested in engaging in productive dialogue with him on policing issues. Members of the Los Angeles chapter of Black Lives Matter have long been calling for Beck to be fired. They contend he has done too little to protect residents of color, and has instead allowed questionable killings by police officers to go unpunished. A group of Black Lives Matter members and their supporters began staging a sit-in at City Hall last week after the Police Commission ruled that the shooting of 30-year-old Redel Jones by an LAPD officer was within department policy. Jones, who was black, allegedly lunged at officers with a knife as police hunted for a suspect who robbed a pharmacy in South Los Angeles. Protesters have pointed to a differing account by a witness who said police shot Jones while she was running away. Beck told the Police Commission today that in contrast to the heated exchanges with Black Lives Matter activists that tend to dominate discussions about policing in Los Angeles, he was able to engage in a more respectful conversation with activists and political leaders during a Washington, D.C., forum hosted last Wednesday by President Barack Obama. During the four-hour-long meeting, which was also attended by Mayor Eric Garcetti and political leaders from around the country, everybody was respectful, everybody listened to everybodys point of view, everybody took something away from it. He said that meeting serves as an excellent example of the fact that people can talk about this topic, that people dont have to be disrespectful in the way that they deal with the other stakeholders involved, that people can listen to other folks ideas and take away something from it. I wish Los Angeles would learn that lesson, he said. Beck said after the commission meeting he is more willing to take part in a dialogue with Black Lives Matter members as long as they are willing to listen to differing viewpoints. If I can get some folks in this movement to want to talk, instead of just scream, if they want to listen instead of just make demands and pontificate, then Im glad to do it, he said. Beck told reporters later that the conversation in Washington, D.C., was a good start for dialogue, although I would prefer to have that dialogue at home, rather than go 2,000 miles for it. Beck today also defined the bigger issued faced by Los Angeles as that of gang violence, rather than police conduct. He said members of the police department and city leaders on Sunday attended a rally to support activists in calling for peace among gang members. Well-known musicians such as The Game, Snoop Dogg and Big Boi were also in attendance. The rallys message, Beck said, was that our communities, particularly some of our communities, are far too violent, and that if we cannot show that we value our own lives, then how do we expect others to value our lives. Beck pointed to last years crime statistics showing a high incidence of shootings being perpetrated by black or Hispanic suspects against people of the same racial or ethnic group, and that the majority of homicides were due to gang violence. The true tragedy of Los Angeles is that we lose far too many young people, unfortunately primarily of color, to gang violence, he said. He told reporters after the meeting that police officers can become affected by the level of violence they encounter in a community. The police are a reflection of the community that they serve, he said. If the community is violent, then often times police have to respond to violence, and during that response you can become immune to it.Beck said he experienced this as a young police officer working in the gang unit during the height of the crime wave in Los Angeles. I literally dealt with hundreds and hundreds of homicides, he said. Pretty soon you felt, well, you begin to lose your humanity, you become immune to it and thats a very real issue in Los Angeles. We are raising kids in communities where they are exposed to violence far too often and far too early, and so we need to address that as a city and as a nation. Becks comments today were met criticism from Black Lives Matter activists and their supporters. Melina Abdullah, one of the leaders of the local Black Lives Matter group, accused Beck of dismissing the Los Angeles chapters activities by holding up the national Black Live Matter as a superior organization. I was in the back, texting Patrice Cullors (a founder of Black Lives Matter), who you tried to throw in our faces ... as if Black Lives Matter national is somehow separate from Black Lives Matter Los Angeles. I hope your investigatory work is better than this as a police officer, because if you investigated anything, you would know that Black Lives Matter began right here in Los Angeles. Black Lives Matter Los Angeles is Black Lives Matter. We are the first chapter. Patrice Cullors is a member of Black Lives Matter Los Angeles, so she wants to vigorously oppose what it is you said. Several activists also took issue with Becks statement that black and Hispanic residents should do more to reduce violence within their own communities, and to value their own lives more. Jody Armour, a USC professor, said that unlike gang members, a police officer is expected to protect the public. When you say, chief -- and this is in a spirit of continuing sharper dialogue, clearer dialogue -- How can we expect others to value our lives when we dont value our own lives, thats really a canard, a red herring and an attempt to change the subject. What were talking about when it comes to police brutality is someone who has taken an oath of office, given a badge and a gun, a monopoly of legitimate violence, they are under color of law in the name of all of us, he said. You cant say that about a gang-banger. Armour added that he has been a big supporter of LAPD. Ive been one of those who has gotten on there and said weve come so far from 2000 and 99, the consent decree ... weve come a long way, but that doesnt mean we rest on our laurels, Armour said. We have so far to go and thats what folks are saying, we still have so far to go. City News Service",1,0,0

In a way, I kind of feel sorry for her. Life was good, she was raking in $80,000 a year at her job as county clerk.

870,"An Indiana man pleaded no contest Wednesday to three felony charges stemming from an incident where police seized weapons, ammunition and bomb-making materials found in his car while heading to the 2016 LA Pride parade in West Hollywood. He was immediately sentenced to seven years and four months in state prison. James Wesley Howell, 22, pleaded no contest to one count each of unlawful assault weapon activity, possession of a destructive device on a public road or highway and possession of a destructive device, Deputy District Attorney Samuel Hulefeld said. Howell was arrested shortly before 6 a.m. on June 12, 2016, by Santa Monica police in the 1700 block of 11th Street, near Olympic Boulevard – mere hours after the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, that left 49 people and the gunman dead. Howell was found sitting in his car when officers responded to a report of a man knocking on a residents door and window. Officers examined Howells white Acura sedan with Indiana license plates and recovered three assault rifles, high-capacity magazines and ammunition along with a five-gallon bucket with chemicals that could have been used to make an improvised explosive device, police said. The sheriffs department bomb squad was called to help make certain the vehicle and area were safe. According to court documents, Howell also had a buck knife, a Taser, a black hood, handcuffs and a security badge in his car. Howell told police he was planning to attend the 46th annual LA Pride Parade and Festival in West Hollywood, but made no reference to doing harm there, according to Santa Monica police Lt. Saul Rodriguez. Santa Monica police Chief Jacqueline Seabrooks and Rodriguez said there was no known connection between Howell and the mass shooting in Orlando. Security was increased at the LA Pride festival as a result of the Orlando massacre and Howells arrest. During Howells arraignment on June 14, 2016, the prosecutor said the defendant had 20 pounds of explosive mix in his car, along with five gallons of gasoline – materials that could create an explosive similar to the one used in the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building. Some of the materials were already mixed in a bucket in the car, the prosecutor said. One day after the charges were filed against him in Los Angeles, Howell was charged with sexually molesting a 12-year-old girl in Indiana. According to the Indianapolis Star, Indiana officials believe Howell left for California after learning he was under investigation in the molestation case. Citing court documents and the victims family, the newspaper also reported that Howell threatened to kill himself, members of the victims family and police if they tried to arrest him. The status of the Indiana case was not immediately known. City News Service and Patch staffer Emily Holland contributed to this post; Image via Santa Monica Police Department",1,4,1

Calum McSwiggan, 26, also paid $7,000 in restitution in connection with his guilty plea Monday to a felony charge of vandalism causing more than $400 in damage, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorneys Office. McSwiggan admitted damaging a car bumper and mirror on June 27. Authorities said the vandalism occurred on the day he claimed that three men assaulted him in an anti-gay hate crime while he was in town from London. A misdemeanor charge alleging that he made a false report about the run- in with the men was dismissed under the plea deal, the District Attorneys Office reported. Had he gone to trial and been convicted of both counts, he could have faced up to 3 1/2 years in jail. On his Twitter account in June, McSwiggan posted, To reiterate, I did not fake this attack and am absolutely appalled that anyone would suggest or think that I did. He posted a longer explanation on his Facebook page, in which he wrote that he left The Abbey on foot with a guy he took a liking to and minutes later blacked out after being punched in the mouth and kicked in the body. I have spent my whole adult life campaigning for LGBT+ equality and did not take this attack lightly, he wrote in his Facebook posting. I cannot say for 100 percent that this was because I was gay but I cant think of any other justification for this random attack. In a moment of devastation, anger and blind rage I kicked the wing mirror of the attackers car until it broke and then ripped it off with my hands.

877,"- The Los Angeles Sheriffs Department on Thursday is looking into threats made against West Hollywood mayor allegedly by Donald Trump supporters a week after she published a letter telling the GOP frontrunner he is not welcome in town. In the letter, published last Monday in the Advocate, a gay newsmagazine, Mayor Lindsay Horvath said Trump and his campaign are not welcome in the LGBT-friendly city because of the hate speech and implicit calls to violence from the campaign. Shortly after the letter was published, the entire West Hollywood City Council received an email implying that Horvath had a secret abortion and contained links to graphic abortion videos. Horvath told Patch the email was an intimidation tactic because of her support for Planned Parenthood in West Hollywood and a womans right to choose. She also suspected then a Trump supporter was behind the email. In the week since Horvath said shes been getting threatening messages allegedly from Trump supporters in response to the letter via email and on social media. One person threatened to gut me like a fish, Horvath told Patch. This is the kind of the language that is indicative of the type of supporters that Mr. Trump attracts. And that is part of the reasons why she didnt want to Trump campaign in West Hollywood. Horvath has turned the threatening emails over to the West Hollywood Sheriffs Station. Horvath said it was standard procedure for her to turn over any threatening messages that are violent in nature. The department has started a preliminary investigation into the matter to see if any laws have been broken, sheriffs Lt. Sergio Aloma said Were looking to determine if the messages rise the level of a crime, he said. We need to see if they are protected by the First Amendment versus the stuff that crosses the line. Aloma said the departments Criminal Intelligence Unit has been consulted to determine the best way to move forward. At this time, we dont know where or who the messages are coming from, he said.

880,"By FRED SHUSTER Former NFL safety Darren Sharper pleaded no contest today to charges of drugging and raping two women he met in a West Hollywood nightclub and also struck plea deals to resolve similar charges in two other states, and he is expected to serve up to nine years in federal prison in Louisiana. Sharper, 39, reached deals with prosecutors in Arizona and Nevada and entered his pleas remotely from Los Angeles. He is expected to be transferred to New Orleans to enter another plea to resolve similar allegations there, and he will serve his prison time in a federal lock-up in Louisiana, attorneys said. Serving the nine years in prison will resolve the cases in all four jurisdictions. The most recent case against Sharper was filed in Las Vegas, where he was charged with sexual assault charges for having sex with two tourists in January 2014 while the women were incapacitated. Prosecutors said Sharper went club-hopping with the women and took them to his hotel room, where he drugged and sexually assaulted them while they were unconscious. The account is similar to allegations made against him in Los Angeles and two other cities. New Orleans officials said he sexually assaulted three women there in 2013. In Arizona, he was charged with drugging three women and sexually assaulting two of them in November 2013 in the Phoenix suburb of Tempe.

883,"Thousands of University of California service workers began a three-day strike Monday at campuses and medical facilities across the state, including at UCLA and UC Irvine Medical Center. Service workers represented by Local 3299 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees voted overwhelmingly last month to authorize a strike if no progress were made in negotiations. UC officials have repeatedly criticized the union for calling the strike, accusing the labor group of rejecting an offer of fair, multi-year wage increases and excellent medical and retirement benefits. The strike got off to a rocky start at UCLA, where a motorist apparently got impatient around 9:45 a.m., and tried to drive through the picketers crossing a street. Police and witnesses said a man in an SUV became irritated when union members were marching through the intersection of Westwood Plaza and Le Conte Avenue. Witnesses said the man initially got out of his SUV with some type of stick and threatened the picketers. He jumped back into his car, he gasses it, one union member told KNX Newsradio. Im holding on to his hood. He brakes, I thought he was going to stop, and as soon as Im trying to move he gasses it again and I just grabbed on again and as hes driving Im telling him to slow down. UCLA Police said three picketers were treated for minor injuries at the scene. The driver was taken into custody, although he appeared to have some difficulty breathing while being arrested and was taken to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center to be checked out, police said. There were no other reports of any other clashes involving union protesters. In light of the impasse in contract talks, the university system last month imposed contract terms on the union for the 2017-18 fiscal year, including 2 percent pay increases. The UCs latest contract offer to the union included annual 3 percent raises over the next four years, according to the university. The union denounced the move to impose contract terms, responding by issuing a notice of a strike set to last until Wednesday. Weve bargained in good faith for over a year to address the widening income, racial and gender disparities that front-line, low-wage workers at UC are living every day, AFSCME Local 3299 President Kathryn Lybarger said. Instead of joining us in the effort to arrest these trends, UC has insisted on deepening them -- leaving workers no option but to strike. UC officials issued a statement saying they strongly disagree with AFSCMEs decision to strike, which will negatively impact patients, students and the UC community. We are doing everything in our power to limit disruptions on our campuses and medical centers to ensure our patients get the care they need and our students the services they deserve, according to the UC. The UC insisted that its service workers -- including custodians, gardeners, food service workers and facilities maintenance staff -- are compensated at or above the market rate, and in some cases, by as much as 17 percent higher than comparable jobs. University officials said the union is demanding a 6 percent annual wage increase, which is twice what other UC employees have received. They said their final officer included, in addition to the pay raises, a lump-sum payment upon contract ratification, health benefits consistent with those of other workers and continuation of pension benefits for existing employees. New employees would be given a choice between a pension or 401(K)- style retirement plan. Lybarger, however, accused the university of subverting the bargaining process by imposing contract terms on workers. Administrators are already showing us that we can expect more unequal treatment if we dont stand up, fight back and hold UC accountable to its hollow claims of pioneering a better future, Lybarger said. According to the union, the strike will involve 9,000 service workers, but they will be joined by more than 15,000 Patient Care Technical workers. The union represents workers such as security guards, groundskeepers, custodians, respiratory therapists, nursing aides and surgical technicians. The workers span UCs 10 campuses, five medical centers, numerous clinics and research laboratories, according to the union.

884,"The first openly gay Los Angeles police officer was charged today assault with a firearm and criminal threats stemming from a dispute with his husband that led to a standoff with sheriffs deputies at the couples West Hollywood home. Retired Sgt. Mitchell Grobeson, 57, was arrested Friday after he allegedly holed up inside a West Hollywood home for nearly four hours before surrendering to a sheriffs SWAT team. He is expected to be arraigned this afternoon at the Airport Branch Courthouse. According to the District Attorneys Office, Grobeson pointed a handgun at his husband last week to force him out of the home. The husband subsequently contacted the sheriffs department, asking for help to remove some of his belongings from the home in the 800 block of West Knoll Drive, prosecutors said. When the deputies arrived at the home shortly after 10 a.m. Friday, Grobeson allegedly barricaded himself inside, beginning the standoff. Crisis Negotiation Team personnel made contact with the suspect requesting him to come out of the residence, according to a sheriffs department statement. The suspect agreed and surrendered to Special Weapons Team personnel without incident. Grobeson sued the city of Los Angeles in 1988, alleging discriminatory practices against gay and lesbian employees by the police department. He won reinstatement to the LAPD as part of a settlement to that suit but later claimed that his bosses held the suit against him and filed a second lawsuit. The entire legal saga took 25 years to play out, and Grobeson finally settled the second lawsuit in 2013. Grobeson is being held in lieu of $250,000 bail, according to the sheriffs department. He faces up to 14 years in prison if convicted, prosecutors said. City News Service",0,8,5

886,"ACROSS COLORADO -- The United States locks up a greater portion of its population than nearly any other country in the world, but the total number of people imprisoned has fallen slowly from its peak in recent years. According to new data from the governments Bureau of Justice Statistics, the number of people incarcerated decreased 1 percent to 1,505,400 people by the end of 2016. While the discussion of criminal justice policy often takes place at the federal level, the vast majority of people who are locked up in the United States are incarcerated by state authorities. At the end of 2016, states had about 1,316,205 incarcerated, while the federal system had a total of 189,192. Theres significant differences in incarceration rates across states as well. Colorado is in the middle of incarceration rates in the country, at number 23, with a rate of 356 per 100,000 people sentenced to a year or more behind bars in 2016. That amounted to 19,862 people in state prisons in 2016. Maine has the lowest rate with 137 per 100,000 sentenced criminals locked up. Louisiana has the highest rate at 760 people per 100,000. The Prison Policy Initiative — an advocacy group that studies the criminal justice system— points out that even states like Maine and Massachusetts, which have some of the lowest rates in the country, lock up a far larger portion of their populations than the vast majority of nations in the world. Check out the full list of state incarceration rates below. So what accounts for the large differences in incarceration rates by state?  The differences in locations prosecution policies matter a lot, Mark Kleiman, professor of public policy at New York University, told Patch. Differences in crime rates matter some, too. Kleiman explained that legislatures can send a message to local prosecutors by controlling the size of the states corrections facilities. If lawmakers decline to build more prisons, prosecutors and judges may adjust their practices to reduce the number of prisoners. If the legislature builds additional prisons, it can encourage a larger prison population. Nationally, theres been pressure to reduce incarceration, said Kleiman. The Obama administration, which was still in power for the period covered by the latest data, was explicit about its intention to reduce the nations incarceration rate. Women make up only about 8 percent of the incarcerated population. Of the entire population included by the Justice Department in this report, 111,422 women are in prison compared to 1,393,975 men. In Colorado, 1,803 women were incarcerated in 2016, roughly one-tenth of the 18,078 men behind bars. While the total national prison population decreased, the number of prisoners identified as Hispanic increased 1 percent between 2015 and 2016. According to The Sentencing Project, an advocacy group that studies racial disparities in criminal justice, black Americans are more than 5 times more likely than whites to be in imprisoned. In Iowa, Minnesota, New Jersey, Vermont and Wisconsin, that figure jumps to more than 10 times. Hispanics are disproportionately represented in prison as well, with an incarceration rate 1.4 times that of non-Hispanic whites.  Kleiman pointed to New York City, which has seen massive reductions in both crime and incarceration in recent decades, as a potential model for the country. The notion that you need huge amounts of incarceration to control the crime rate doesnt seem to be supported, he said. He argued that the city has been able to substitute good police working for putting people in prison, adding, Theyve also made policing less intrusive. The Prison Policy Initiative also points out that the topline incarceration figures do not count the entire population in custody. The Justice Departments statistics presented here, for example, do not count people kept in jails without being sentenced. It also does not include other punitive measures such as people on parole or probation. Incarceration rates do not always tell the complete story of the criminal justice system in each state, write Bernadette Rabuy and Peter Wagner for PPI. Notably, some of the states that are the least likely to send people to prison, such as Rhode Island and Minnesota, are among the most punitive when other methods of correctional control are taken into account. Given the recent fall in the crime rate overall, Kleiman was optimistic that the trend toward keeping fewer people in prison nationwide would continue. If crime were rising, though, there may be calls to lock more people up. The public is not panicked about crime, Kleiman said. The main way to get incarceration down is to get crime down. The Justice Department counts prisoners as sentenced if a court has sentenced them to a year or more in prison. Some people, however, sit in jail or prison for less than a year or without being formally sentenced, so these numbers undercount the number of people held by the government. It also doesnt count people held in immigrant detention centers or awaiting deportation. The figures do include children. Excluding people age 17 or under, some of the incarceration rates are significantly higher. For example, counting only sentenced adults, Texass rate jumps from 563 per 100,000 to 761 per 100,000. Louisianas rate jumps from 760 per 100,000 to 997 per 100,000 — nearly 1 percent of the adult population. Read the full report.

891,"Denver police once again asked the public for help Tuesday to solve the Aug. 9 triple-slaying of three people identified as itinerant near an RTD Light Rail station in the 700 block of Broadway Ave. The bodies of Nicole Nikki Boston, 28, Jerome Rome Coronado, 39, and Chris Little Cowboy Zamudio, 44, were found by police around 11 a.m. behind a building at 765 S. Broadway near the Interstate-25 overpass. The office of the Denver Medical Examiner said Monday all three died of gunshot wounds. Denver police on Aug. 9 said the trio appeared to be homeless, based on living conditions. RTD police were also assisting in the investigation. Denver police have not said whether they believe the three victims in this case knew their killer or killers, or whether the scene showed signs of an altercation. At this point, its unclear whether the act was a random attack. Police on Tuesday confirmed that another incident that happened nearby was not related to the triple homicide. Early Thursday morning at about 4:36 a.m. a man was stabbed about 500 feet away from the crime scene. He was hospitalized in critical condition. Kyle Cuffe, 20, was arrested in connection with that stabbing. Related: 3, Possibly Homeless, Found Dead In Denver Near I-25 Police and Metro Denver Crime Stoppers have offered $2,000 for information leading to an arrest in the case. Homeless are vulnerable People experiencing homelessness in metro Denver are already vulnerable, said Colorado Coalition for the Homeless spokesperson Cathy Alderman, and this incident just shows how exposed they are, she said. Predatory type people prey upon vulnerable people, she said. People experiencing homelessness are easier to assault, because they are sometimes [hiding] in unusual places. Theyre easy to steal from because they have no safe place to keep their belongings. Denver police reported in 2018 that crimes against homeless people in 2017 had risen by more than 40 percent to 1,008 incidents reported. Alderman said that might be a combination of more crimes being reported and more crimes happening. Many crimes go unreported because theres a distrust of the police, Alderman said. The National Coalition for the Homeless has campaigned since 2012 to pass national legislation categorizing attacks on homeless people as a form of hate crime. Alderman said that Colorado homeless advocates were starting to think about supporting that policy as well. Its always awful when tragedy is the thing that elevates an issue, but it is an opportunity to talk about how dangerous it is for folks to be forced to sleep outside and try to survive, to be concerned about their safety, their next meal, where they can use a sanitary bathroom, Alderman said. To have to worry about your life-and-death safety at the same time, its untenable to imagine thats how we let people live.  Image via Denver Police  Stay up-to-date on Denver news with Patch!

892,"A former U.S. Marine, accused of fatally stabbing a fellow former Marine who was his Thanksgiving dinner houseguest, is scheduled to be arraigned in Denver criminal court July 2. Chris Fernandez, 53, is charged with first-degree murder in the death of Logan Crosby Kelly, 24, in Fernandezs home on Nov. 23, 2017. Witnesses told police Kelly, a Florida native, had lived in Colorado for only three months and was invited, along with a co-worker, by Fernandez to his home in the 1500 block of South Patton Court for Thanksgiving dinner, according to an arrest affidavit. The two men arrived at Fernandezs home around 2:15 p.m., drank beer and watched football on television, the co-worker told police. After dinner, the group, along with Fernandezs wife, played Pictionary. Fernandez and Kelly began to argue about the Marines, the witness told police. At one point Fernandez hit Kelly a few times with the blunt end of an axe, but then the two made up and hugged. Before 10 p.m., the co-worker announced he was ready to leave, and he told police he went outside and started his truck. When he returned for Kelly, he told police Fernandez told him to leave without Kelly, the affidavit said. Believing Fernandez to be kidding, the co-worker told police he drove his truck around the block, then parked with the engine running and returned to collect Kelly, the arrest affidavit said. As he walked to the porch, he told police he observed Fernandez coming out of the house with a kitchen knife in his hand. Fernandez said, Im sorry, the man told police. When he walked past Fernandez into the house, he told police he saw Kelly lying on the floor in a pool of blood. He said he asked Fernandez what he did and Fernandez used a racial slur to describe Kelly. Police arrived around 10:04 p.m., the affidavit said. When interviewed by police, Fernandez reportedly said he had F---ed up and said he didnt remember what had happened, but he knew he had blood all over him. At one point Fernandez said he remembered sticking someone, but he couldnt remember with what, saying possibly a lead pipe. He also said he was drunk and couldnt remember what he had done. Fernandez was taken into custody and has been held in Denver County Jail on no bail. Kellys death was caused by sharp force injuries, the Denver Medical Examiner said.

893,"A 22-year-old Colorado student was severely beaten and left for dead along a section of train tracks in Truckee last Tuesday in what the students family is calling a hate crime. Amtrak authorities investigating the case have said there is no evidence Portland State University student Aaron Salazars injuries suggest criminal intent, but the mans family believes he was beaten into a coma and burned because he is gay. Salazar was reportedly riding an Amtrak train back to Portland from Denver, Colorado, when he stopped for what should have only been a 10-hour layover during the 31-hour trip. He reportedly told his family over the phone that he planned to explore Sacramento during the layover, but he never made it. A worker at the train station in Truckee reportedly found Salazar lying near the tracks on May 15. Salazar sustained a broken pelvis, severe burns on his thighs, multiple brain injuries, and a damaged brain stem; he hasnt opened his eyes since he was found, according to a May 22 update on the GoFundMe.com page raising money for his medical expenses. Aaron has been trying to open his eyes recently and we are very optimistic, Austin Sailas wrote on GoFundMe.com. Aaron is still healing from the burns, and has been fighting a fever but even still his progress is remarkable. Unfortunately as many know we have been fighting with the AMTRAK department for Answers and at this point we are expecting a very long, and expensive process and are ready to fight. Doctors have apparently told Salazars family that the injuries are consistent with a beating, but no one has officially confirmed thats what happened. The Amtrak investigation is ongoing, and Salazars cousin, Sonia Trujillo, reportedly believes the company has clouded priorities. What Im concerned about is, were dealing with the Amtrak police department on an Amtrak train, Trujillo told RawStory.com. I dont know if theyre trying to protect the train or if theyre trying to protect the people. Salazar reportedly texted his grandmother just before the train stopped in Truckee to tell her hed made a friend with whom he planned to explore Sacramento. No other information about that individual is available. Whats more, Salazars family says no money or belongings were taken. So, while the family believes Salazar was beaten, they maintain it must have been a hate crime because he was not robbed. I believe it was something deeper because the burn marks. Why burn somebody?, Trujillo asked RawStory.com. If youre going to hurt somebody, hurt them. But why are you going to burn somebody? A GoFundMe.com account quickly raised the familys initial goal of $5,000, so they increased it to $10,000 to help the family cover expenses — since Salazars parents arent working while they wait for their son to wake up. In the five days since the GoFundMe.com account was created, Samaritans from across the country have helped raised more than $14,000 (as of May 23). To donate, follow this link.

894,"- Denver police believe Robert Feldman, accused of first degree murder, strangled his wife on the day in 2015 she found out he was having an affair with another woman, according to an affidavit unsealed Monday. Robert Feldman, then 53, called police around 3 p.m. March 1, 2015 to report he found his wife, Stacy Feldman, 44, unresponsive in a bathtub with the shower running, the affidavit said. Feldman reportedly told officers his wife had attended a party the night before and consumed several doses of marijuana edibles. He said she was not feeling well when he took the children to a Temple function in Denver. Stacy Feldmans original autopsy said her cause of death was undetermined although it did list scrapes and abrasions on her face, torso and extremities. Stacy Feldman did not have any traces of marijuana in her system, although the medical examiner found traces of anti-depressants and other drugs. Denver detectives observed that Robert Feldman appeared to be overreacting and gave them conflicting stories about how he found his wifes body, the affidavit said. Feldman also allegedly interfered with fire rescue personnel who called him over-dramatic and purposely not cooperative as they tried to resuscitate Stacy Feldman. Feldman did not want to have an autopsy performed on his wife, the affidavit said. Denver police asked for another opinion from a national expert on domestic violence involving strangulation and suffocation. In December, 2017, the experts reports said he believed Stacy Feldman had been strangled to death and listed the cause of death as homicide, the affidavit said. At that point, Denver detectives made moves to arrest Feldman. Officers took him into custody on Feb. 13. Police got a break in the case when a woman called Metro Denver Crime Stoppers June 11, 2015 to say she had contacted Stacy Feldman by email March 1 when she figured out Robert Feldman had allegedly lied on a dating site about being divorced. She told police she had met Feldman in February through the Tinder dating site and that Feldman had come to her house for dinner, after which they had sex. She told police Feldman had said his last name was Wolfe. When Feldman blew her off and stopped returning her calls, she was able to find Robert Feldmans information and realized he was likely married to Stacy Feldman. She told police she found Stacy Feldmans email and contacted her to ask if the couple was divorced. The two spoke by phone and Stacy Feldman told her she and Robert were not divorced, the affidavit said. Stacy allegedly told the woman Robert had cheated on her before and that she was done with him. Police also got an anonymous letter from an acquaintance of the couple who said Robert Feldman had acted odd that day after dropping their two children off at religious school and that Stacy was supposed to pick the young children up, but never showed up. Robert finally showed up late to pick up the children, after another acquaintance took them to the temple carnival. Police also said Robert Feldman had taken out a $750,000 life insurance policy on Stacy Feldman, but there was no life insurance policy for Robert. Robert told Stacys family members that he was going to receive a large insurance payment, the affidavit said. In the recording of the 911 call made by Robert Feldman police said they heard a toilet flushing and Feldman made several guilty indicators to dispatchers, including not appearing to be out of breath while allegedly performing CPR on his unconscious wife, the affidavit said. Feldman was arrested and charged with first-degree murder. Hes being held in the Denver jail on no bond. Image: Robert Feldman via Denver District Attorneys Office",1,4,0
895,"- From The Colorado Independent By Susan Greene A prominent criminal defense investigator in Colorado is in jail for refusing to testify in a capital case she says is in conflict with her religious beliefs. Greta Lindecrantz, 67 and a devout Mennonite, had been subpoenaed by 18th Judicial District Attorney George Brauchlers office to testify in the appeal of her former client, Robert Ray, one of three men on Colorados death row. Ray and his co-defendant Sir Mario Owens were convicted and sentenced to death for the 2005 killings of Javad Marshall-Fields and fiancée Vivian Wolfe in Aurora. Rays appeal pivots partly on claims that he had inadequate legal representation at his 2009 trial. Prosecutors hope that testimony from Lindecrantz – a highly respected, veteran investigator who has worked on several death penalty cases and in defense of detainees at Guantanamo Bay – will help them prove that Ray had competent legal defense and prevent his conviction from being overturned. Lindecrantz faced both a subpoena by prosecutors and an explicit order by Arapahoe District Judge Michelle Amico that she testify about her work for Ray or risk being found in contempt of court and sent to jail for up to six months. This is now me telling you directly … and Im ordering you to answer the questions, the judge told her Monday afternoon. I dont want to do this, Ms. Lindecrantz. All I want to hear is the truth.Id have no problem saying the truth if death wasnt on the line, Lindecrantz, in tears, responded from the witness stand. I dont believe in killing fellow human beings or participating in that. Then came a slow, painful back and forth between Brauchlers Chief Deputy Ann Tomsic and Lindecrantz, who no longer works on Rays defense team but is resolute in her conviction that testifying on behalf of prosecutors could lead to what she considers state-sanctioned murder. Tomsic asked Lindecrantz more than 70 questions about her work for Ray. And, more than 70 times, Lindecrantz wouldnt respond. I cannot answer your question, shed say, her voice at once sad and shaky, yet firm. I cant answer your question, shed repeat with the next question. I cant answer your question, shed repeat again.

897,"Avon police officers recently participated in training on fair and impartial policing, reports the Hartford Courant. The training was recommended by the state after a report showed many police departments in Connecticut showed racial and ethnic bias when making traffic stops. Avon was not one of the 10 departments named, but chose to participate in the training anyway. The report showed that the percentage of minorities who were stopped for motor vehicle violations by police in the Farmington Valley exceeded that for the population as a whole in those communities. The training was attended by 30 local and state police officers, including officers from Avon, Canton, Farmington, Simsbury, Windsor, and Granby.

900,"The state Department of Correction has agreed to serve an inmate at Corrigan-Radgowski Correctional Institution in Montville something other than fish when it comes up on the prison menu after the inmate asked for help from the animal-rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, The Day of New London reported. The inmate — Howard W. Cosby — enlisted PETAs help after he requested a vegetarian diet as a practicing Buddhist and the DOC balked, claiming fish was not a meat. PETA wrote a letter that asserted, in part, that fish have thoughts, interests and a central nervous system. According to The Day, Deputy Warden Giuliana Mudano recently wrote PETAs attorneys to say the state would give Cosby a nutritionally adequate substitute whenever fish would appear in his menu cycle. Cosby was arrested for sexually assaulting a teenager in Bridgeport in 2002, convicted in 2004 and sentenced to 20 years in prison. Were very pleased that (the warden) has acceded to Mr. Cosbys legally grounded religious demands and acknowledged that fish arent swimming vegetables, said attorney Jeff Kerr, general counsel to PETA, in The Day story.

902,"By BRIAN MCCREADY (Patch Staff) Mike Lawlor, who is the Under Secretary for Criminal Justice Policy and Planning, said Tuesday there has been a significant drop in arrests and in pre-trial commitments to jail in Connecticut. The first six months of 2015 were marked by a significant decline in all data relating to new arrests and admissions to jail, compared to the first six months of 2014. It is worth noting that calendar 2014 had the fewest arrests in more than 40 years, Lawlor said. Between 2008 and 2013, the FBI reported that index crime [crime with victims] dropped 18.2 percent in Connecticut. During that same period, total statewide arrests dropped 27.3 percent in Connecticut. During 2013, the most recent year for which reported crime data is available, the FBI reported that violent crime dropped 10 percent in Connecticut, double the national average of 5 percent for that year. To sign up for news alerts and more, click here. We can now report that this trend is continuing, if not accelerating, in 2015, Lawlor said in a prepared statement. During the first six months of 2015, total statewide criminal arrests were down 9.3 percent compared to the first six months of 2014. Total arraignments in court for in-custody new arrests were down 4.8 percent. Total pre-trial admissions to jail were down 9.2 percent during the same period. The overall July 1 jail pre-trial population of prisoners being held because they could not post bail dropped 8.3 percent compared to July 1, 2014. The sentenced population in Connecticut prisons dropped 2.6 percent, with an overall drop in inmate population of 3.2 percent compared to July 1 of last year. For specific numbers, in the first six months of 2014 there were 44,335 arrests made in Connecticut, and for the first six months of 2015 that number has been reduced to 40,268 arrests. Also the number of arraignments has decreased from 17,482 over the first six months of 2014 compared to 16,636 in the first six months of 2015. Also the number of people incarcerated has also declined from 16,561 in 2014 to 16,025 in 2015 during the first six months of the year. One of the consequences of this continuing drop in admissions to DOC has been the closing of jail beds, including the 204 beds at the Bridgeport Correctional Center resulting in a full year savings of $2.1 million in reduced overtime and related costs, Lawlor wrote in a statement. Governor Malloys Second Chance Society initiatives are expected to continue to reduce crime over the next few years by focusing on recidivism reduction, prioritization of violent and firearms offenses and appropriate treatment and supervision of non-violent, low level offenders, added Lawlor. The recently opened Reintegration Center at Cybulski Correctional Institution is the first of many Second Chance Society initiatives expected to reduce recidivism and returns to prison. Connecticut was recently selected as a recipient of the MacArthur Foundations national Safety and Justice Challenge Grant aimed at safely reducing our jail population and, in particular, reducing the racial disparity in state jails. As part of the grant, Connecticut received $150,000 to prepare a plan by December to continue these reductions in crime and the consequent reduction in arrests and admissions to jail. MacArthur will then select 10 jurisdictions nationwide to each receive $4 million over two years to help implement the successful plans, Lawlor said.",0,8,5

Hayes, 51, describes himself in a hand-written civil rights complaint as an orthodox practicing Jew and claims that he has been continuously denied the kosher diet he has been requesting since May 2013. The complaint comes on the heels of the other man convicted in the killings, Joshua Komisarjevsky, seeking a new trialbecause tapes of Cheshire police calls allegedly were not provided to the defense team during his trial. Both men were convicted, in separate trials, with felony murder and sentenced to death for the 2007 killings of Jennifer Hawke-Petit and her children, Michaela, 11, and Hayley, 17. Both Komisarjevsky and Hayes are appealing their convictions. In his complaint, Hayes wrote that his First Amendment and Eighth Amendment rights are being violated. Hayes wrote that the denial of a kosher diet is a clear violation of my 1st Amendment Right to freely practice my religion of choice, Judaism. Hayes wrote that it is also cruel and unusual punishment since the denial of the kosher diet forces me to eat non-kosher food in order to survive (food is a basic need). I have also experience (sp) secondary weight loss due to refraining from eating non-kosher products. Hayes also wrote that he suffers a metabolic allergy to soy and his acceptable food choices are severely limited. I have been suffering almost starvation for the past year, Hayes wrote. Public Defender Thomas Ullmann, who represented Hayes at his trial, told Michelle Tuccitto Sullo of the New Haven Register that he is pleased Hayes  has some spiritual interest and is occupying his mind. The Register reports that Ullmann also said Hayes desire for kosher food is a legitimate request and added I am happy he is finding some spiritual solace.

906,"The following is a letter to the editor written by Bill Hillman, Chairman of the Bethel Republican Town Committee. As chair of the Bethel RTC, Im expected to support Republican Candidates. The reason I chose to lead the BRTC is because of the quality of our incumbent elected Senators Toni Boucher and Michael McLachlan, State Representative Steve Harding, and especially the incredible spectrum of talent in our other candidates seeking office. Dan OGrady has 20 years experience as Bethels Probate Judge. With an impressive 30 year career, the regional probate district would be well served electing as Judge Dan OGrady. Will Duff is seeking the 2nd district State representative office vacated by U.S. Senate candidate Dan Carter. Will has served Bethel as a selectman, on the board of education, and runs a local business. The Malloy menace-democrat-supermajority must be shaken loose of its death-grip on Connecticut. Its vital that we throw that majority out in both the State House and Senate so that Connecticut can rise from the gutter of business, jobs and people leaving. Truly change is needed, believe me; its also time to make Connecticut great again. The democrat blue-state problem cant be more profound than the job destroying tax loving delegation from Connecticut to the United States House and Senate. Clay Cope isnt your typical Republican. A fiscal conservative first selectman from Sherman, Clay has reached out to all the 41 Towns in the 5th district. An openly gay candidate who strongly honors our Constitution, he has a unique perspective that distances him from the incumbent puppet of the DNC. Dan Carter, an Air Force Veteran has proudly served us as a State Representative. His real-sense approach makes a strong contrast to his publicity seeking 40 year career politician and one percenter.

908,"By Wendy Ann Mitchell (Patch Staff) & Brian McCready (Patch Staff) In January 2012, at the Connecticut General Statutes Sec. 54-1m, also known as the Alvin W. Penn Racial Profiling Prohibition Act, requires the state to submit an annual report to the Governor and General Assembly to review the prevalence and disposition of traffic stops and complaints in Connecticut. Over the past fifteen years, racial profiling has been recognized as an issue of national, state, and local concern facing law enforcement agencies, William Dyson, Chair of the project wrote in the report. The state of Connecticut released their report in September 2014 of traffic stop data from information collected October 1, 2013 through May 31,2014. According to the report, Connecticuts requirement for police agencies to collect and report traffic stop information is the most extensive of its kind anywhere in the country. There are 2.54 million Connecticut residents who are of driving age or older. During that time frame there were 366,000 traffic stops across the state. The language that police agencies used to describe ethnicity and background information of traffic stops in their report is Blacks, Whites, and Hispanic, rather than African American and Caucasian. Blacks account for 8 percent of the population and were pulled over 14 percent of the time, while Hispanics account for 10 percent of Connecticuts population and were pulled over about 12 percent of all traffic stops. In Bethel there is a population of 14,326 residents 16 or older. There were 2,586 traffic stops in Bethel from October 1, 2013 through May 31,2014. Whites account for 89.04 percent of the population, Blacks, 2.52 percent and Hispanics, 8.04 percent.

910,"Police Chief Frank Cappiello issued a statement concerning allegations that some officers acted inappropriately to volunteers of State Senate candidate Sean Grace while campaigning in town recently. Cappiello conducted a review of the allegations made against the officers. As part of this review, in addition to examining all material evidence, I have spoken to Mr. Grace, both canvassers, the resident at the home where the incident took place, as well as, the officers involved. I share the following information to clarify any misperceptions that seem to have arisen. The police response was not self-initiated, but was a result of officers being dispatched to that specific area on a call for service after a concerned resident called and reported two males going from house to house knocking on doors. The Police Department has recently responded to unrelated calls for service involving unregistered solicitors from a private company, who were advised to discontinue their activities until they complied with the Towns soliciting permit process. Upon arrival, the officers found that the two males were not solicitors, but were political campaign canvassers. Following a brief conversation with other neighbors, who approached the officers and felt it necessary to speak on behalf of the canvassers, and after confirming that no trespassing or permitting issues had occurred, the canvassers were promptly allowed to continue with their campaign efforts in the area. The officers never told the canvassers to cease their activity, nor did they follow or monitor the canvassers travels after allowing them to continue. I applaud the resident who promptly reported the incident for doing exactly what we have been urging the public to do – look out for your neighbors, be vigilant and promptly report any unusual or suspicious activity immediately. See related story: Political Candidate Suspends Campaign Over Disturbing Incident I find that the Police Departments response to this call for service was proper and the officers investigation of the incident was thorough, expeditious and impartial. It involved absolutely no racial bias whatsoever on the part of the responding officers. This is a topic for which our personnel receive mandatory training during each recertification period and is a behavior that would never be condoned or tolerated by my Administration. Any unfortunate misperceptions surrounding this incident, which have been recently circulating, should not overshadow my officers daily dedication to duty and this Departments ongoing commitment to community service and safety. Although there is no wrongdoing on the part of the Woodbridge Police Department in this situation, due to the current climate that exists today, we are planning to proceed with additional training regarding situations of this kind, Cappiello concluded his official statement.",0,8,5

Bridgeport, CT - One of the two Connecticut men accused of stealing skeletal remains from a Worcester, MA cemetery has avoided charges. Prosecutors will not pursue a case against 41-year-old Felix Delgado of Bridgeport because bones found in his residence do not match those he was accused of stealing from the Hope Cemetery in February, reports the Worcester Telegram & Gazette. Forensic anthropologists from both Massachusetts and Connecticut were called in to study the remains and made the determination. Delgado and another suspect, Amador Medina of Hartford, were both allegedly found in possession of human bones, and they told authorities that they are priests who practice Santeria, a religion that mixes elements of African and Christian faiths. The bones in their possession were part of religious programs, they said. However, the use of human bones is not considered part of Santeria, reports the Telegram & Gazette, according to theology experts. The publication added that Palo, a similar religion from Africa, has been known to use human remains. While Delgado has avoided charges, Medina has not, and the case remains under investigation. Medina has been indicted on five felony counts of disinterment of a body and remains incarcerated, writes the Telegram & Gazette. He is back in court in Worcester later this month.

Five municipal departments and one state police troop in Connecticut were identified to exhibit a statistically significant racial or ethnic disparity that may indicate the presence of racial and ethnic bias including: Bloomfield, New Milford, Norwalk, West Hartford, Wethersfield and State Police Troop H. Additionally, 25 police officers throughout Connecticut were deemed to be more likely to pull people over based on race, the report notes.",0,8,5

The report data is compiled and analyzed every year by the Connecticut Racial Profiling Project. The data comes from stops made between Oct. 1, 2015 and Sept. 30, 2016. An in-depth follow-up analysis will be done on Berlin, Monroe, Newtown, Norwich, Ridgefield, Darien and State Police Troop B departments after some disparities were noted. The departments are invited to share in the analysis. ...racial and ethnic disparities in any traffic stop analysis do not, by themselves, provide conclusive evidence of racial profiling, researchers wrote in the report. Statistical disparities do, however, provide significant evidence of the presence of idiosyncratic data trends that warrant further analysis. In 2016 the Connecticut Police Chiefs Association released a press release that said to date no police chief has been informed that their department or officers have engaging in biased based policing from the reports findings. Executive Director Pamela Hayes said that the association was looking to identify actual driving populations because many of the departments singled out for further review are next to a larger and more metropolitan city. The Brookfield Police Department conducted 2,299 stops during the studys time period. How the stop ended: Here is a breakdown of the top 5 reasons for a stop rounded to the nearest percent. Data from stops is analyzed in a number of ways such as a comparison between daylight and complete darkness stops. The assumption of the technique is that officers profiling motorists are more likely to do it during the daylight where a motorists race is apparent. Researchers also compare the number of minority traffic stops to the towns minority population over the age of 16. Bridgeport, Middletown and Hartford appeared in the lowest rate of traffic stops, but researchers noted many werent correctly entered into the system. State Police Among State Police Troops:",0,8,5

A recent report by the Connecticut Racial Profiling Prohibition Project found that the Brookfield Police Department conducted 3,223 traffic stops from Oct. 1, 2013 through Sept. 30, 2014. The reasons a Brookfield police officer is likely to pull you over include: 29.8 percent; speeding infractions; 27.5 percent; cell phone offenses, 10.4 percent; defective lights, 1.3 percent; display of plates, 0.4 percent; equipment violation, 7.8 percent; moving violation, 3.5 percent; registration offense, 2.5 percent; seatbelts, 6.7 percent; stop signs, 0.7 percent; suspended license, 6.5 percent; failure to obey traffic control signals, 0.1 percent; window tint and 2.7 percent; other. There is a good chance you will be given a verbal or a written warning rather than a ticket in Brookfield. According to the report, among the 3,223 stops, officers gave a ticket 22.99 percent of the time, a written warning 33.79 percent of the time and a verbal warning 38.5 percent of the time. Of Brookfields total traffic stops 3.07 percent are for Black drivers and 75.76 percent of those stops involve non-residents, according to the report. Hispanics account for 8.72 percent of Brookfields traffic stops and 83.63 percent of those involve non-residents, the report states. Overall, 1,164 resident stops were made in Brookfield with 7.47 percent of these stops accounting for minority residents.

Canton police officers recently participated in training on fair and impartial policing, reports the Hartford Courant. The training was recommended by the state after a report showed many police departments in Connecticut showed racial and ethnic bias when making traffic stops. Canton was not one of the 10 departments named, but chose to participate in the training anyway. The report showed that the percentage of minorities who were stopped for motor vehicle violations by police in the Farmington Valley exceeded that for the population as a whole in those communities. The training was attended by 30 local and state police officers, including officers from Canton, Avon, Farmington, Simsbury, Windsor, and Granby. The animal control officer for Avon and Canton also attended. In Canton, the population that is at least 16 years of age is 96.75 percent white, 1.94 percent Hispanic, and 1.31 percent Asian/Pacific Islander.

925,"Avon Police Chief Mark Rinaldos former secretary has filed a complaint with the Connecticut Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities (CHRO) against the police department. Nichole Brown, of Farmington, claims that racial discrimination and retaliation factored into her demotion to a records aide, suspension and eventual termination. I was suspended without pay/transferred/demoted on or about March 27, 2012 due to my race/color (black), I was the recipient of bias in Respondents investigation and appeal process due to race/color and in retaliation for complaining about discrimination on or about April 11, 2012, and I was issued a written warning and terminated on or about June 6, 2012 and believe that my race/color (black), previous opposition were in part factors in this action, Browns complaint, dated July 17, stated. Rinaldo received notification from the CHRO of the complaint on Aug. 6. PDFs of the Browns CHRO complaint and previous appeals, as well as internal police department investigation reports and termination recommendation letters are attached to this article. While Brown felt that her punishment was more severe than usual for department employees, Avon Police Department leadership said that the actions were taken because of misconduct on her part. Any claim that the Town of Avon took an adverse employment action against Ms. Brown for reasons other than her own misconduct is in conflict with overwhelming evidence to the contrary, Avon Police Capt. Jeffrey Blatter wrote in an email to Avon Patch. Brown began working as a per diem dispatcher for Avon in 2009 and also was a Canton police dispatcher at the time. In November 2011, she left her Canton dispatching position and accepted a probationary administrative secretary II job in Rinaldos office. In March, she was suspended for five days without pay and demoted to a records aide position because department leaders felt that she overstepped her authority. By June, she was terminated. Im trying to be able to clear my name about being dishonest and unethical,  said Brown, who has worked for municipalities since she was 18 and was temporarily a police officer in Plainville. To be labeled as that was heartbreaking for me. Additionally, on Sept. 13, the state Employment Security Appeals Division in Waterbury dismissed Browns motion to reopen the case for a Aug. 16 appeal. Her appeal contested the Department of Labors July ruling that she was ineligible unemployment benefits. Brown had filed an unemployment benefits claim with the Employment Security Division in June after the town of Avon denied her unemployment benefits following her termination. Brown said the termination took a toll on her mentally and she and her husband financially. They went from two incomes to one and she is also concerned because they need insurance to cover therapy for their child who has Down syndrome. Browns Suspension and Demotion Her suspension and demotion were disciplinary measures taken after she drafted an update to a previous sick bank leave policy in February without authorization from Rinaldo, according to an internal investigation conducted late that month. She sent the policy to Town Manager Brandon Robertson and then to Human Resources, also intending it for two police union presidents. I was demoted for an innocent mistake and I admitted my mistake, Brown said, noting that she appealed the claim that her actions were dishonest and unethical. She said Rinaldo asked her to pull the file for the sick bank leave policy. A dispatcher needed to go on leave because a family member had medical issues. The existing policy allowed workers to donate unused paid sick days to employees who needed that time off for medical reasons. It didnt originally pertain to immediate family, but she said her edit from will not to will changed the meaning to allow it. Ms. Brown exceeded the scope of her assigned duties and responsibilities, and acted outside the authority of the chief of police, according to the investigation conclusion. Brown said she told the human resources assistant that she changed the word. No one was harmed or slighted in any type of way, Brown said. According to Blatters investigation report, Brown told him she was trying to help her fellow employee and was not trying to misrepresent the policy draft change. Brown said that when she couldnt find the chief to ask him what to do with the policy, she asked Blatter. She said he responded by asking her what she thought she should do and whether the chief needed to sign off on it. Brown admitted that she wasnt given direction on what to do, but she said she didnt think she needed the chiefs signature to draft an update to the policy so she took the initiative because it was out of date. Browns Termination On March 4, Brown was demoted to the Records Division. Brown said that two people that knew of her edit to the sick bank leave policy werent interviewed in the internal investigation. She tried to find a past email with evidence validating her claim, but she was given a new username and was not able to access her original email account. She contacted the information technology representative that serves the department on April 25 to ask for help accessing her original email account. Rinaldo asked Blatter to do a second internal affairs investigation when he found out that she did this without his permission. Blatter determined that Brown violated a department general order for attempting to access a department account she was not authorized to access. Brown said that she received notification of the investigation two hours after she asked Robertson about the status of a Freedom of Information request related to her demotion and suspension. In a letter Rinaldo wrote to Robertson recommending Browns termination, he also said that Brown showed disrespect to Lt. Kelly Walsh when she resumed work after her suspension. She didnt make eye contact with Walsh in a meeting outlining her new responsibilities as a records aide, the letter said. Brown said that was because she was taking notes. He also said that she created a hostile workplace environment by not being cordial to another coworker. In a letter Blatter wrote to Rinaldo recommending her termination, he said that in May, Brown threw mail on and around the in-basket for Rinaldos new secretary, Pamela Prado, who was promoted from records aide to fill the position. Brown left the room without saying a word to Prado, the report said. Brown said that she no longer knew who to trust in the department after her suspension and demotion, so she decided to do her job and avoid personal chit chat. Why Brown Filed CHRO Complaint Before going to the CHRO, two appeals Brown filed to overturn the disciplinary measures taken against her were unsuccessful. My understanding is that the people who made the decision to demote me were going to hear my appeal, she said. She wanted to file a grievance against the town with the State Labor Board of Mediation, but said the town refused to do so because her appeals were considered closed. They abused their authority and did everything to block my right to due process, Brown told Patch. Thats why I had to go to the CHRO. Brown said last week that the process for the CHRO complaint is still in its early stages. Timeline of Events",1,0,3
926,"A federal judge in Connecticut has rejected convicted killer Steven Hayes motions for a hearing and temporary injunction following a complaint he filed that he hasnt been given a kosher diet to conform to his religious beliefs, according to the New Haven Register. U.S. District Court Judge Alvin Thompson, in a ruling dated Tuesday, wrote that Hayes (one of the men on death row for the 2007 Cheshire home invasion triple homicide) is offered kosher meals, and the state Department of Correction has two rabbis who periodically monitor the preparation of kosher foods in the prison system, according to the Register, and that both certify the food and the preparation process comply with Jewish dietary laws. While Thompson didnt throw out the lawsuit, in rejecting the motions he found there is not a likelihood that it will succeed, according to the Register. Read more at the New Haven Register here. Hayes, 51, sued the state Department of Correction in August, claiming his rights are being violated because he isnt being given a kosher diet to conform to his religious beliefs. According to multiple reports, Hayes went on a food strike on Aug. 24 and had lost about 50 pounds. He filed an amended complaint on Nov. 7 in which he described extreme weight loss, according to the New Haven Register. Hayes, who is 5-foot-7, reportedly hasnt eaten any non-kosher food since Aug. 24 and now weighs less than 120 pounds after weighing 170 pounds in 2007. Hayes, via the Register, says he has suffered almost two years of emotional injury from having to choose between following God and starving or choosing sin to survive. In August, Hayes described himself in a hand-written civil rights complaint as an orthodox practicing Jew and claims that he has been continuously denied the kosher diet he has been requesting since May 2013. According to WTNH, the department offers kosher food, but Hayes contends it isnt kosher because of cross-contamination. Hayes and Joshua Komisarjevsky were both convicted, in separate trials, with felony murder and sentenced to death for the 2007 killings of Jennifer Hawke-Petit and her children, Michaela, 11, and Hayley, 17. Both Komisarjevsky and Hayes are appealing their convictions. In his August complaint, Hayes wrote that his First Amendment and Eighth Amendment rights are being violated. Hayes wrote that the denial of a kosher diet is a clear violation of my 1st Amendment Right to freely practice my religion of choice, Judaism. Hayes wrote that it is also cruel and unusual punishment since the denial of the kosher diet forces me to eat non-kosher food in order to survive (food is a basic need). I have also experience (sp) secondary weight loss due to refraining from eating non-kosher products. Hayes also wrote that he suffers a metabolic allergy to soy and his acceptable food choices are severely limited. I have been suffering almost starvation for the past year, Hayes wrote.

The teens, a 14-year-old and a 15-year-old, turned themselves in to police custody on Oct. 3 with the aid of a parent, according to a police press release. They were both charged with second-degree criminal trespass and second-degree criminal mischief. Their names werent released because they are juveniles. Hamden police responded to Hamden High School on June 27 on the report of criminal mischief. Investigation revealed that two Cheshire High School students entered the school during the early evening hours and vandalized several interior walls and doors throughout the building, according to police. Police said the juveniles used magic markers to write on these surfaces. In addition, the juveniles defaced a Hamden High School sign that depicts the schools core values and beliefs. The students wrote racial slurs, as well as sexual connotations, throughout the sign. Hamden High School sustained approximately $300 in damages, according to police. Detective Mark Consorte conducted an investigation which led to the application of the two arrest warrants. The teens are scheduled to appear in Juvenile Court in Waterbury on Oct. 14.

Darien received a disparity score of 4.5 out of a possible nine points. Darien Police Chief Ray Osborne said in a statement that the Darien department aims to treat all motorists fairly and equally, and that the public should not draw final conclusions from the reports findings. The Darien Police Department is strongly committed to treating all motorists who use ourroadways in a fair and impartial manner, wrote Osborne (his full statement can be viewed at the bottom of the story). We believe that it is of the upmost importance to treat all people that we encounter with respect and dignity. While we applaud the efforts to ensure public trust in law enforcement, peer review of previous reports has raised questions about some of the methodology used. It is our intention to meet with the project managers of the report in the near future for additional clarification and evaluation. Data from stops is analyzed in a number of ways such as a comparison between daylight and complete darkness stops. The assumption of the technique is that officers profiling motorists are more likely to do it during the daylight where a motorists race is apparent. Researchers also compare the number of minority traffic stops to the towns minority population over the age of 16. Bridgeport, Middletown and Hartford appeared in the lowest rate of traffic stops, but researchers noted many werent correctly entered into the system. State Police Among State Police Troops: Darien Police Chief Ray Osbornes complete statement: The Connecticut Racial Profiling Prohibition Project has released its latest report covering theperiod of October 1, 2015 to September 30, 2016. This report contains raw traffic stop datacollected from every Connecticut community as well as the Connecticut State Police. Since theinception of this program on October 1, 2013, the Darien Police Department has fully compliedwith the requirement mandating the submission of traffic stop data to the State of Connecticut.In this latest report, the Darien Police Department is listed as one of the Connecticut agenciesthat will be invited to be a part of follow-up analysis based on conclusions they have made fromexamining traffic stop data from this one-year period. This is the first time that Darien has beenso listed in any of these reports. Readers of this report are cautioned not to draw any final conclusions from this report. As statedin the executive summary of the report racial and ethnic disparities in any traffic stop dataanalysis do not, by themselves, provide conclusive evidence of racial profiling. Statisticaldisparities do, however, provide significant evidence of the presence of idiosyncratic data trendsthat warrant further analysis. The Darien Police Department is strongly committed to treating all motorists who use ourroadways in a fair and impartial manner. We believe that it is of the upmost importance to treatall people that we encounter with respect and dignity. While we applaud the efforts to ensurepublic trust in law enforcement, peer review of previous reports has raised questions about someof the methodology used. It is our intention to meet with the project managers of the report inthe near future for additional clarification and evaluation. Fairness and transparency is essential in law enforcement. We are fortunate to live in a diverseregion of Fairfield County and we pledge to work hard to maintain the confidence of all peoplewho live, work and travel through our community.

933,"A swastika and an unnamed racial slur were discovered written on a tennis court at Dariens Weed Beach Park on Saturday morning, May 27, according to police. Officers responded to the scene just before 11 a.m. after the vandalism was reported. Officers observed that on one of the tennis courts in the complex, several racially charged markings had been made, wrote Darien police in a statement. One marking was in the shape of a swastika and the other was a racial slur. A third word was observed, but was illegible. The size of the swastika was approximately 18x18 inches, and the racial slur was approximately 12x36 inches. The markings were made in chalk, therefore responding officers were able to completely clean the markings immediately. There was no permanent damage to the court. Officers asked around to find any witnesses to the incident, or further evidence, but were unsuccessful, and there are currently no suspects. Patch file photo",1,0,3

Police saw Jason G. Levesque, 32, of Mack Road, Middlefield, fleeing the scene, slowed to a walk at Court Street, made eye contact with an officer, and again took off running, according to police, behind Liberty Bank. He was found hiding in a stairwell in the rear, employee-only area of LaBoca, police say, wearing a NOMADS Outlaw biker gang white tee-shirt. The victim, a Wesleyan University math professor, was sitting outside in his Toyota RAV4 with an ice bag on his head and injuries to his forehead and left ear, according to police. The victim said he was driving on Main Street, then stopped, put on his hazard lights to wait for a car to pull out of the spot he hoped to park in, when a man on a motorcycle drove the wrong way down Main Street and shot into the parking space. Police say the victim made a comment to Levesque as did another man, who told him to get back into his car, while Levesque called the victim a racial slur several times, punched him in the face and ear. The second man, the report says, jumped on the bike and drove away. A witness told police he saw Levesque beating on the victim who was in his Toyota and a cell phone video confirmed the report. The report says Levesque told police, what about the fact that he threatened me with a gun? to which the officer asked why he would open a car door and punch someone seven to eight times in the face if he had a gun. The victim denied having a weapon when police contacted him, saying, Ive never had a gun or owned a gun in my life. No other witnesses saw a gun, police say. Levesque, who was charged with breach of peace, second-degree intimidation based on bigotry and interfering with an officer, has a record of five arrests, including disorderly conduct, failure to appear, breach of peace, violation of a protective order, threatening and assault.

942,"New details have been released concerning the firing of former Detective Monique Colbert. The East Haven Police Department released a 37-page Internal Affairs Investigation report Thursday as a result of a Freedom of Information request. Large portions of the report was redacted but what was visible reveals that Colbert was arrested twice in June of 2017, while living in Meriden. She was accused of hitting a Meriden police officer, spitting at an officer and using a racial slur directed at a family member, according to the Internal Affairs report. Colbert was hired in 2001 and at the time was the Police Departments first black officer. She again made history in 2015 when she was promoted to detective. On June 7, Meriden police officers responded to a domestic disturbance at Colberts house and she and two others were charged. Colbert was charged with disorderly conduct under family violence, according to the IA report. She turned over her two duty guns and an off-duty pistol, the report states. As part of her release, Colbert was given a no-contact order, the report states. On June 8, Colbert was suspended with pay by the East Haven Police Department. Then on June 11, Colbert was arrested again in Meriden, this time for a protective order violation, the report states. Colbert was arrested because she was present during a domestic disturbance involving other family members in the house, which violated the protective order, the report states. On June 14, Colberts status with the East Haven Police Department was changed to unpaid leave of absence, the report states. Meriden police officers testified during the East Haven Police Departments Internal Affairs investigation. Meriden officers said in their testimony that Colbert spat at an officer, slapped an officers elbow causing it to turn red, and she also yelled, Dont push me. Dont touch me. Im not gonna go outside. I got no clothes on. Are you serious. Im a cop. Im a cop, the IA report states. Meriden police said they detected an odor of alcohol coming from Colbert as well, the report states. East Haven police reviewed body cam footage, which they say showed that Colbert did swing her left arm three times and you could hear smacking on two occasions, the report states. At one point, the Meriden officer told Colbert that she got him good. On July 17, Colbert was cleared to return to duty because the charges were nolled, and the protective order was lifted, the report states. Meriden police officers involved in the incidents expressed surprised that the charges were nolled, or dismissed so fast, the report states. Colbert was informed that she was still the subject of an Internal Affairs investigation. Colbert was interviewed as part of the IA investigation and she denied Meriden police officers account of what happened during the two incidents. She said she didnt drink or strike a police officer, and she said she didnt use a racial slur either, the report states. She did admit to spitting on a police officer, the report states. After reviewing the entire record, the Police Department concluded that Colbert violated four department policies and her employment was terminated by the Board of Police Commissioners last week. Colberts legal representatives told the New Haven Register earlier this week that Colbert is in disbelief that she was fired and they are confident that shed get her job back.",1,0,3
943,"Active Police Officer Vincent Ferrara has filed a lawsuit against the department and the town claiming he was discriminated against because he helped the federal government in a racial profiling case that dates back more than five years ago, WTNH News 8 reports. The officer claims he was labeled a rat, and that one officer placed a gun to his chest as a form of intimidation in an effort to stop him from cooperating, the suit claims, according to News 8. As a result of the racial profiling case four officers were arrested. Over the past couple of years, the Police Department has been praised by federal officials for the steps its made to improve the department. The U.S. Attorney General visited the department and praised its turnaround. For more details on the officers suit, read the full News 8 story here. In December 2016 Mayor Joseph Maturo Jr. addressed police officers and issued the following press statement at the time. It reads: East Haven Mayor Joseph Maturo, Jr. in recognition of the four-year anniversary of the federal courts December 21, 2012 approval of the Towns Agreement for Effective and Constitutional Policing with the Department of Justice, recently addressed officers at 4:00PM roll call to congratulate the department on its sustained reform efforts and remarkable turnaround. Maturo explained, I am proud to announce that we have met and exceeded each and every benchmark for success specified in our agreement with the Department of Justice both on-time and under budget. After four years of hard work by our officers and the entire compliance team, we have restored pride, trust, and confidence in our Police Department. On December 11, 2011, the Department of Justice issued a civil findings letter alleging a pattern and practice of biased policing, unconstitutional searches and seizures, and excessive force which eventually led to the January 24, 2012 arrest of four East Haven police officers. Maturo recollected, When I addressed our department personnel at roll call on the day our officers were arrested, the mood was somber, morale was low, and no one quite understood how we were going to chart a path forward for our embattled department. However, after nearly a year of negotiation with the Department of Justice, we agreed to embark on an expansive and unprecedented set of reform efforts to revolutionize our Police Department. After four years of collaboration with the Department of Justice, those efforts have transformed our department into a model for other small departments across the nation. In July of 2015, following a series of positive reports on the departments ongoing success and transformation, Attorney General Loretta Lynch visited East Haven as part of a national community policing tour. In describing East Havens blueprint for success, she explained, [t]his is a message that were hoping other cities can look to and see how this change is implemented here. It does take a lot of work. It takes a lot of will. It takes a lot of effort, but it can be done. Shortly after Lynchs visit, Mayor Maturo and police command staff attended a community policing forum at the White House to share the Towns story of success with forty other departments from across the country. Maturo continued, Today, our police department is on the forefront of the policing industry. Our department doesnt just employ best practices. Rather, thanks to the sound leadership of young police executives like Chief Ed Lennon and through collaboration with the Department of Justice and other policy experts, our department is actually helping to define what best practices entails in a number of policy areas. Maturo explained, My goal in speaking to and congratulating our officers at roll call today is to recognize their incredible contributions to this turnaround. While our police executives and policy experts charted this path, our patrol officers have been the ones to walk it step by step. Theyve earned the communitys trust with each respectful patrol stop, each pleasant encounter, and on each perilous occasion theyve put their lives on the line to protect this community. Theyve exhibited an eagerness and willingness to both learn and transform and I am very proud to be able to recognize them for their contributions to the reform effort. While the Towns agreement with the Department of Justice contemplates a four-year reform timeline, the Town has a few pending matters to square away before it formalizes a request to terminate the court agreement. Maturo explained, We are excited that we can begin the discussion about terminating the compliance agreement and embarking on a new era of self sufficiency for our department. As we explore that next-step, we intend to work closely and cooperatively with the Department of Justice to square away the remaining procedural matters. Theyve been our partner each step of the way in this process and I have instructed our team to continue to work closely with them to ensure a smooth transition for our department. Maturo concluded, There were many who doubted whether our community was capable of making the sustained changes contemplated in our compliance agreement with the Department of Justice. There were even some who rooted against us. Today, our department and our community are models of tolerance and respect. I am grateful to our residents for their trust and support on this long and difficult journey and I am proud to say, in no uncertain terms, that we succeeded.",0,8,5

The top reason an East Haven police officer pulls someone over is for stop sign violations. Out of 3,194 traffic stops, 18.57 percent were stop sign offenses, 14.7 percent for cell phones, 14 percent for defective lights, 12 percent for registration offenses, and 7.33 percent for speeding. East Haven police are toward the bottom in the state when it comes to issuing speeding tickets per traffic stop. If you are pulled over in East Haven the odds are likely you wont get a ticket. A ticket was issued just 28 percent of the time in 2015, and 58 percent of the time the motorist drove away with just a verbal warning. Out of 3,194 traffic stops in 2015, 97 resulted in searches in East Haven and 7.2 percent of stops involved black motorists and 14.5 percent, Hispanics. The report states that in Connecticut 14.1 percent of 585,000 traffic stops between Oct. 1, 2014 and Sept. 30, 2015 involved black residents and 12.5 percent involved Hispanic motorists.

945,"Operation Not In My Town, has resulted in the arrest of five men who are accused of arranging sexual liaisons with children (fictional characters) that they made contact with using social media, Guilford Police announced Tuesday. Between Jan. 12 and Jan. 14 at the direction of and in collaboration with the New Haven Office of the States Attorney, the Guilford Police Department and the Veterans 4 Child Rescue Foundation conducted Operation Not In My Town, which is a regional/multi-jurisdictional joint/parallel sting operation focused on identifying and arresting potential sex offenders that had arranged sexual liaisons with children (fictional characters) they made contact with using various social media applications over the intent, police said. Police said several law enforcement agencies assisted including: Branford, Clinton, Fairfield, Madison, Milford, North Haven, West Haven, the Shoreline Technical Crimes Investigative Group, and the Connecticut Human Trafficking Task Force. The operation was also filmed as part of a documentary by the Veterans 4 Child Rescue Foundation and was designed not only to arrest sexual predators that are lurking literally a text message or mouse click away, but to also raise awareness to the realities of child sexual exploitation and the importance of internet safety in keeping our children safe while on-line, police said. Guilford Police will be hosting and participating in educational seminars on this topic too in an effort to increase awareness and educate citizens, police said. Parents and educators are also encouraged to contact the Guilford Police Department Crime Prenvention Unit at 203-453-8061 for information on internet safety. While law enforcement will continue to investigate crimes perpetrated against our most vulnerable; parents and families have a responsibility to educate themselves and to have open and frank discussions with their children about the dangers they face. These dangers are real. Lets work together to ensure that no more children fall victim to these dangerous predators, Guilford Police said in a statement. Here are those who were arrested in the sting: Gregorio Rafael Diaz, 24, of Ravine Street in Putnam. He is charged with criminal attempt to commit second-degree sexual assault and criminal attempt to commit risk of injury. He was held in lieu of a $500,000 bond.

947,"North Central Connecticut was in an uproar on Monday over a video featuring a party at which some participants wore Ku Klux Klan outfits that has been circulating around social media. State police said they are looking into the matter. At first, the rumor mill late Monday morning placed the party in Stafford. State police at 1:15 p.m. confirmed it was actually in East Windsor. State police spokeswoman Trooper First-Class Kelly Grant said state police are now investigating the matter. That was after an investigation by the Stafford First Selectmans Office and the Resident State Troopers in that town. Stafford First Selectman Anthony Frassinelli said he and state state police met with two people who live in Stafford and attended the party. The first thing Id like to make perfectly clear is that the party was not in Stafford. That fact has been verified that it took place in another town, he said. Frassinelli said there was one resident from Stafford in attendance who was seen in the video. They apologized for being there and are full of remorse and embarrassment about being involved, he said. They want to make sure the public knows that they unequivocally denounce the KKK-looking costume and that they again apologize and said it was just that — a costume. He added, We have zero tolerance regarding bigotry or hate regardless of where it happens. The state police are aware as is other law enforcement and is continuing to investigate it. Grant did not elaborate on whether criminal charges are possible. North central and and eastern Connecticut have a history with Klan-like gatherings. Two are considered the most infamous. There was a rally on the property of self-proclaimed East Windsor Constitutional activist Ed Thrall in 1986. Five years before that, a rally was staged in the town of Scotland. Comments on Staffords Facebook page supported the quick response. Thank you for a no tolerance of this type of behavior. It is much appreciated, one resident said. I recognize that this is a very serious matter for the Town of East Windsor and our residents, East Windsor First Selectman Robert Maynard said in a written statement. Racist behavior and bigotry is intolerable in our community, and the Town has a responsibility to investigate the behavior exhibited in the video. Hate itself is not a crime— and we are mindful of protecting freedom of speech and other civil liberties. Im asking the residents of our town to give our police department the time to thoroughly investigate the tape. If the department finds cause to prosecute people identified in the video, they will do so. When a small community like East Windsor - filled with good, caring people - are tested in this way, we must stand together to condemn bigotry and hatred, but we must also follow the rule of law and trust in the work of our law enforcement officers. East Windsor Selectman Jason Bowsza said, I want to thank the East Windsor Police Department, and specifically Detective Sergeant Matthew Carl, for the very professional way that the department has handled this breaking news and denounced it. East Windsor is better than this. We are not a community that is bigoted, hateful and xenophobic. There is no place for hate crimes that make people feel devalued, unwelcomed and unsafe. Ive knocked on thousands of doors in our town, and have had an opportunity to get to know the families here. These families are why Ive stayed. The type of behavior that happened this weekend is not who we are. We are a community that values inclusion. We value tolerance. We value compassion and understanding. We are a caring place where anyone is welcomed. This weekends event was not just kids being kids. It was a reminder to all of us that hate and bigotry are part of the world we live in, and that we need to renew our commitment to each other and to ourselves that we need to be part of the solution that makes East Windsor, our state, and our country a better place.

950,"Operation Not In My Town, has resulted in the arrest of five men who are accused of arranging sexual liaisons with children (fictional characters) that they made contact with using social media, Guilford Police announced Tuesday. Between Jan. 12 and Jan. 14 at the direction of and in collaboration with the New Haven Office of the States Attorney, the Guilford Police Department and the Veterans 4 Child Rescue Foundation conducted Operation Not In My Town, which is a regional/multi-jurisdictional joint/parallel sting operation focused on identifying and arresting potential sex offenders that had arranged sexual liaisons with children (fictional characters) they made contact with using various social media applications over the intent, police said. Police said several law enforcement agencies assisted including: Branford, Clinton, Fairfield, Madison, Milford, North Haven, West Haven, the Shoreline Technical Crimes Investigative Group, and the Connecticut Human Trafficking Task Force. The operation was also filmed as part of a documentary by the Veterans 4 Child Rescue Foundation and was designed not only to arrest sexual predators that are lurking literally a text message or mouse click away, but to also raise awareness to the realities of child sexual exploitation and the importance of internet safety in keeping our children safe while on-line, police said. Guilford Police will be hosting and participating in educational seminars on this topic too in an effort to increase awareness and educate citizens, police said. Parents and educators are also encouraged to contact the Guilford Police Department Crime Prenvention Unit at 203-453-8061 for information on internet safety. While law enforcement will continue to investigate crimes perpetrated against our most vulnerable; parents and families have a responsibility to educate themselves and to have open and frank discussions with their children about the dangers they face. These dangers are real. Lets work together to ensure that no more children fall victim to these dangerous predators, Guilford Police said in a statement. Here are those who were arrested in the sting: Gregorio Rafael Diaz, 24, of Ravine Street in Putnam. He is charged with criminal attempt to commit second-degree sexual assault and criminal attempt to commit risk of injury. He was held in lieu of a $500,000 bond.

952,"An NYPD officer facing disciplinary action for tackling retired tennis pro James Blake, a former Fairfield resident, in front of a Midtown Manhattan hotel in 2015 has filed a lawsuit against his accusers, the officers lawyer told Patch. Officer James Frascatores lawsuit names Blake, New York City, the NYPD, the Civilian Complaint Review Board and HarperCollins Publishers — which published Blakes book Ways of Grace: Stories of Activism, Adversity, and How Sports Can Bring Us Together — as defendants, Frascatores lawyer Peter Brill told Patch. The lawsuit was filed Monday afternoon in the Southern District of New York, Brill said. The lawsuit accuses the various defendants of defamation, civil rights abuses and denying Frascatore due process, according to Brill. A claim based on racial discrimination was filed not because Frascatore was discriminated against for being white but because he was improperly labeled a racist, Brill said. The NYPD declined to comment on the upcoming litigation. We will review the complaint and decline further comment while Officer Frascatores disciplinary proceeding and now this lawsuit are pending, a city Law Department spokesman told Patch. In his first public comments since the 2015 arrest, Frascatore told the New York Post that tackling Blake was the right call given the information he was provided. I have a family to go home to. Im on a crowded sidewalk, with a possibly armed suspect in the middle of 42nd Street, Frascatore told the Post. You have to take control of the situation. I cant just be pulling out my gun. The officer has been placed on modified duty since NYPD surveillance video of the takedown was released in 2015. The video shows Blake, now 37, standing at the Grand Hyatt New York entrance, fiddling with his cellphone, when Frascatore approaches him and quickly throws him to the ground. Frascatore was in plain clothes at the time of the arrest. NYPD officials said in 2015 that the tennis star had been mistaken for a man wanted in connection with an identity-theft ring. Then-NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton and Mayor Bill de Blasio personally apologized to Blake when the arrest was first publicized. In June, Blake agreed not to sue the city. In exchange, a legal fellowship will be created in his name to strengthen the citys police watchdog agency, the Associated Press reported. The two-year fellowship will focus on helping people navigate the civilian complaint process and push for strong investigations into police misconduct, according to the report.

953,"A Pennsylvania man has been sentenced to more than seven years in prison for his role in a kidnapping and jewelry store robbery in Fairfield in 2013. Jeffrey Houston, 30, of Allentown, Penn., also received three years of supervised release following the 90-month prison sentence, U.S. States Attorney Deirdre M. Daly announced in a press release. Houston was part of a group that stormed into a Gravel Street apartment in Meriden and bound four people on April 11, 2013, according authorities. Houston, Kasam Hennix, William Davis and Christopher Gay were all wearing masks and gloves and two were armed with handguns. The victims were bound with duct tape and their heads were covered with pillowcases, towels and jackets. (To sign up for Fairfield breaking news alerts and more, click here.) Houston, Hennix and Davis then forced two of the victims into a victims vehicle and drove to Lenox Jewelers in Fairfield, where the two victims worked. Timothy Forbes traveled to Fairfield in a separate vehicle, and Gay remained in the Meriden apartment to guard the two other victims. After Houston, Hennix and Davis arrived at the Fairfield store, they stole jewelry, watches and loose diamonds with a total replacement value of more than $3 million, Daly wrote in the press release. They then fled in the victims car, leaving the two victims bound inside the store. Houston, Hennix and Davis abandoned the victims vehicle and got into Forbess vehicle. One of the defendants called Gay to advise him that they had successfully carried out the robbery and that he should leave the apartment. The defendants then fled the state. The five defendants were arrested in May 2013. Investigators determined that Houston, Forbes and Gay had traveled from Pennsylvania to Connecticut on several occasions in the weeks prior to the robbery in order to track the victims movements between Lenox Jewelers in Fairfield and their residence in Meriden. In addition, Forbes and Gay placed a GPS on one of the victims vehicles in an effort to make it easier to track him. On Dec. 8, 2015, Houston pleaded guilty to one count of interference with commerce by robbery and one count of use of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence. Forbes, of Allentown, Hennix, of Easton, Pa., Davis, of Allentown, and Gay, of the Bronx, N.Y., also pleaded guilty to federal charges. On April 17, 2015, Davis was sentenced to 176 months in prison; on January 27, 2016, Gay was sentenced to 102 months in prison, and, on February 8, 2016, Hennix was sentenced to 171 months of imprisonment. Forbes awaits sentencing. The defendants have been ordered to pay restitution of more than $3.1 million, and have forfeited gemstones, jewelry, watches, a vehicle, and more than $127,000 in cash seized from them at the time of their arrests, according to Daly.

957,"Farmington police officers recently participated in training on fair and impartial policing, reports the Hartford Courant. The training was recommended by the state after a report showed many police departments in Connecticut showed racial and ethnic bias when making traffic stops. Farmington was not one of the 10 departments named, but chose to participate in the training anyway. The report showed that the percentage of minorities who were stopped for motor vehicle violations by police in the Farmington Valley exceeded that for the population as a whole in those communities. The training was attended by 30 local and state police officers, including officers from Farmington, Avon, Canton, Simsbury, Windsor, and Granby. The animal control officer for Avon and Canton also attended. In Farmington, the population that is at least 16 years of age is 87.41 percent white, 7.19 percent Asian/Pacific Islander, 3.20 percent Hispanic, and 2.20 percent black. For the Farmington Police Department, 70.64 percent of people stopped were white, 6.39 percent were Hispanic, 6.18 percent were black, and 1.85 percent were Asian/Pacific Islander.

958,"Editors Note: We ran this previously, but wanted to bring it back in case you missed it. Farmington Police are pretty balanced when it comes to enforcing all types of motor vehicle laws. A recent report by the Connecticut Racial Profiling Prohibition Project looked at traffic stop data across Connecticut police departments for a 12 month period that ended on Sept. 30, 2014. The reason why a Farmington officer is likely to pull you over includes: 16.2 percent for speed-related, 18.6 percent for cell phone use, 9.1 percent for defective lights, 13.4 percent for a moving violation, 15.3 percent for registration, 4.1 percent for seatbelt, 10.9 percent for a traffic control signal. The wide range of violations is indicative of a well-rounded approach to enforcing a variety of traffic issues with speeding and cell phone use being the highest, said Lt. Colin Ryan, police spokesman. We have our fair share of fatal crashes in Farmington and we have always emphasized enforcing the motor vehicle violations that are likely to cause motor vehicle accidents. In about 47 percent of the stops a motorist received an infraction and about 39 percent received a verbal warning. About 6 percent of stops resulted in a misdemeanor summons and 3 percent in a written warning. There were 107 searches during the 4,525 stops conducted by Farmington Police during the report time, or a 2.36 percent search rate. This put Farmington in the middle of the pack for search rate among departments throughout the state. Farmington was 10th on the list for highest arrest rates during a motor vehicle stop at 2.2 percent. The state average is less than one percent, but Farmington is a far cry away from New London where 7.3 percent of stops result in an arrest.  Arrests following traffic stops happen for a variety of reasons with DUI being the most frequent, Ryan said. Farmington PD has, and always will enforce the DUI laws rigorously.",0,8,5
959,"Targeting those with mental health issues ranging from depression to schizophrenia, Robert King allegedly lured more than a dozen young men into a sex trafficking operation which lasted more than two decades, according to court documents. Danbury police revealed Thursday that an investigation into a city-based sex trafficking ring has resulted in the arrests of three men who participated in the scheme. Court documents show that King was the ringleader of the operation, delivering young men to high-paying clients in a sex-for-money scheme. Police also arrested well-known Glastonbury businessman Bruce J. Bemer, 63, and William Trefzger, 71, of Westport, who were identified as clients by King, court documents allege. READ ALSO: Im just a gay guy trying to help people, King, 50, allegedly said to police at the time of his arrest on Aug. 13. Upon his arrest, King told investigators he only delivered the young men to clients during interviews. Arrest affidavits allege King would identify young men with mental health needs and disorders and befriend them with promises of work, money and necessities. The victims would hang out around Kings trailer located near the Danbury Fair Mall for a period of time. Victims told police King would offer them drugs such as heroin and cocaine in order to build up a debt. When victims were unable to pay King back, he offered them a way out through sex work, according to court documents. Clients would have King deliver the victims to them, and sometimes they would travel to his Miry Brook Road trailer for sex. They would pay the victim between $200 and $250 for sex, and King would get $50 of that price. Bemers attorney John Droney told Patch he could not make a substantive comment at this time, but said he is in the process of investigating the people who are making the charges. The charges are very serious and troubling, said Droney.I am in the process of investigating those who are making these charges, and will be able to comment further once that is complete. Patch has yet to determine who is representing King and Trefzger, but will reach out for comment when we do. Through their investigation, detectives identified 15 victims of the ring. Two of the victims had conservators appointed for them. The ages of the victims was not expressly described in the documents. Victims were identified as having a variety of mental health disorders, some being regarded as incapable of living on their own. Two of the victims were on probation and some lived in group homes. Court records and media reports paint a bizarre picture of Kings relationship with the young men. The News Times reports several neighbors at the mobile home park described King as having a nasty temper. Neighbors also reported loud music often coming from his trailer and boys coming in and out, often believed to be high on drugs. One neighbor described to the publication that one of the young men was seen running around like he was pretending to be a bird. One victim told investigators he met King while he was searching dumpsters for bottles. King struck up a conversation and befriended him before offering him a place to stay. He later introduced the young man to cocaine, which led to him building up a debt, and then to Bemer. Another recounted an incident in which he was suffering from an overdose and said King continued to drive from Waterbury to Torrington while the victim was overdosing. The man described Kings actions as demonstrating an extreme indifference to (the victims) life and resulted in the near death and overnight hospitalization of (the victim), court records allege. Two of the 15 victims identified in the investigation are no longer living, according to court records. During a search of Kings home, investigators found a shrine to one of the victims who was killed in a car crash in 2009. Both King and another victim told police they believed the young mans death was a suicide. Court records show King connected victims with at least eight wealthy clients in Connecticut and Massachusetts. He referred to both Bemer and Trefzger were identified as clients in the investigation. Bemer owns the New London-Waterford Speedbowl, New England Motor Sports and Glastonbury-based Bemer Petroleum. During an interview with police, Bemer said he has known King for 20 to 25 years and was delivering kids or boys to him for sexual services. Bemer referred to the victims as kids or boys during the interview but told investigators that all were over the age of 18. He further told investigators he stopped having sex with one of the victims because he got too old, according to the arrest affidavit. He allegedly told police that King brought him eight to 10 boys for sex, and he would pay between $200 to $250 per encounter. Victims told police that he would have them delivered to his home, hotel or office. Trefzger, a Westport resident who was sentenced in 2010 for touching another man in a sexual manner, admitted to his involvement as well as knowing that one of the victims had mental problems that caused hospitalization, according to the affidavit. According to Danbury police, both are charged with patronizing a trafficked person and are being held on a $500,000 cash-only bond. Police say additional arrests are expected in the case.

He also will register as a sex offender. The father of the 11 and 15-year-old girls reported the assaults to police in May of last year. Baker was acquainted with the girls and family.

965,"A recent report by the Connecticut Racial Profiling Prohibition Project found racial and ethnic disparities for motor vehicle stops in several police departments throughout the state. The authors of the report collected and analyzed mounds of data relating to traffic stops throughout the state. One piece of data they paid particular attention to was for disparities in motor vehicle stops of minorities compared to minority populations in areas. Data was from Oct. 1, 2013 to Sept. 30, 2014. Authors noted the findings were indicative of racial and ethnic bias but, in the absence of a formal investigation, cannot be considered comprehensive evidence. You cant measure what you cant count, said David mcGuire, staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union of Connecticut. This information confirms that racial bias is a reality on the states highways and roads. Now that we can pinpoint problem areas, it is incumbent upon police departments to recognize and correct the bias that is driving many of their traffic stops. Overall, the study found that 13.5 percent of motorists stopped were black and 11.7 percent were Hispanic. Although we find results at the state level, it is important to note that it is specific officers and departments that are driving these statewide trends, the authors wrote. Authors also worked under the Veil of Darkness methodology, which is a statistical technique. It infers that officers who want to profile are more likely to do it during daylight hours when they can better determine the race or ethnicity of motorists.  Granby Minority stops accounted for 9 percent of all Granby stops. The authors said that there are, sufficiently strong results to make a determination that these results indicate the presence of a significant racial and ethnic disparity that is occurring in Granby. Of all stops 5.66 percent were of black motorists, compared to Granbys black population over the age of 16, which is .92 percent.  Waterbury Waterbury police pulled over minorities in 64.8 percent of all stops. About 32 percent were Hispanic and 32 percent were black. The results of the post-stop analysis also indicated that minority motorists, as compared to their Caucasian counterparts, were being searched more frequently relative to the rate at which they were found with contraband, the authors said. Waterbury also had the highest search rate for stops at 28.8 percent. State Police Troop C The troop made 15.2 percent minority stops. The results of the post-stop analysis also indicated that minority motorists, as compared to their Caucasian counterparts, were being searched more frequently relative to the rate at which they were found with contraband, the authors noted. Troop C covers 10 towns, five of which have resident trooper programs, including Mansfield. Shift determinations are made by towns and not state police for the majority of resident troopers. The interrelationship of these staffing patterns with overall Troop C operations is one of the factors that will be considered when further investigating the Troop C data for the source of the statistical disparity, authors said. State Police Troop H The troop was observed to make 37.5 percent minority stops, 13.5 percent Hispanic and 22.5 percent black. Although the post-stop analysis could not be conducted due to an insufficient sample of vehicular searches, the analysis using the Veil of Darkness produced sufficiently strong results to make a determination that these results indicate the presence of a significant racial and ethnic disparity that is occurring in State Police H, the authors said. The results of these analyses indicate that further investigation into the source of the observed statistical disparity is warranted. Other departments specifically mentioned Seven departments showed that stop data exceeded disparity thresholds in three out of four benchmark areas, as well as a majority of 12 possible measure. Departments in this category include: Wethersfield, Hamden, Manchester, New Britain, Stratford, Waterbury and East Hartford.  An additional five departments exceeded disparity threshold levels in three of four benchmarks and six of the 12 possible measures. They include: Meriden, New Haven, Newington, Norwich and Windsor.",0,8,5

968,"A veteran Hartford Police Department detective accused of uttering racial slurs during the course of his arrest for driving under the influence in Plainville last summer has been fired, according to Deputy Chief Brian Foley. Robert Lanza, an 11-year member of the department assigned to the Special Investigations Division, was involved in an off-duty incident on Aug. 27, 2017 in Bristol and Plainville, resulting in his arrest by Plainville police on charges of operating under the influence of liquor or drugs and interfering with police, Foley said. During the course of his arrest, Lanza identified himself as a Hartford police officer, repeatedly used racial slurs, showed evidence of animus towards individuals based on race, suggested that individuals of certain races are treated less favorably by law enforcement due to their race, provided false information to Plainville police officers, refused to comply with requests from Plainville police to exit the vehicle, resisted efforts by Plainville police to be handcuffed, requested special treatment because of employment as a Hartford police officer and attempted to intimidate Plainville police by advising them to never come to Hartford, Foley said. The Hartford Police Department Internal Affairs Division immediately initiated an internal investigation that resulted in sufficient cause to charge Lanza with two violations of the Hartford Police Department Code of Conduct: The charged violation of Article II, Section 2.09 is being held in abeyance pending adjudication of the criminal case, Foley said. These actions were egregious, deplorable and completely unacceptable for a Hartford police officer, and are grounds for termination even before considering their present and future detrimental effect upon the operations of the Hartford Police Department, Foley said in a written statement. This causes concerns over Detective Lanzas ability to perform the functions of a police officer, as well as the public trust and legitimacy in his ability to enforce the laws equitably without regard to race or ethnicity. His behavior discredited the Hartford Police Department, undermined the good order and discipline of the Department, and damaged working relationships with other law enforcement agencies. Based on this, along with consideration given to the nature of the misconduct, the findings of the investigation, the evidence presented by both sides at the Disciplinary Hearing, the Hartford Police Department has concluded that termination is the only appropriate course of action. Effective today January 8, 2018, Detective Robert Lanza was dismissed from the Hartford Police Department. Photo courtesy of Plainville Police Department",1,0,3
969,"The FBI on Monday released its Hate Crime Statistics Report for 2016, and Hartford was mentioned. The report is the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting Programs latest compilation about bias-motivated incidents throughout the nation. Submitted by 15,254 law enforcement agencies, the 2016 data provide information about the offenses, victims, offenders, and locations of hate crimes. Law enforcement agencies submitted incident reports involving 6,121 criminal incidents and 7,321 related offenses as being motivated by bias toward race, ethnicity, ancestry, religion, sexual orientation, disability, gender, and gender identity. The UCR Program does not estimate offenses for the jurisdictions of agencies that do not submit reports. Hartford police participated and had one sexually motivated incident along with 5 racial incidents in 2016, according to the report. Here is a national summary: Victims of Hate Crime Incidents Offenses by Crime Category Known Offenders In the UCR Program, the term known offender does not imply that the suspects identity is known; rather, the term indicates that some aspect of the suspect was identified, thus distinguishing the suspect from an unknown offender. Law enforcement agencies specify the number of offenders and, when possible, the race of the offender or offenders as a group. Beginning in 2013, law enforcement officers could also report whether suspects were juveniles or adults, as well as the suspects ethnicity when possible. Locations of Hate Crimes Law enforcement agencies may specify the location of an offense within a hate crime incident as 1 of 46 location designations. In 2016, most hate crime incidents (27.3 percent) occurred in or near residences/homes. More than 18 percent (18.4) occurred on highways/roads/alleys/streets/sidewalks; 9.9 percent occurred at schools/colleges; 5.7 percent happened at parking/drop lots/garages; and 3.9 percent took place in churches/synagogues/temples/mosques. The location was reported as other/unknown for 12.7 percent of hate crime incidents. The remaining 22.1 percent of hate crime incidents took place at other or multiple locations.

In fact, of the departments nearly 3,000 traffic stops, 42 percent were for speeding followed by cell phone, 14.5 percent, defective lights, 13 percent, traffic control signal, 11.8 percent, and 7 percent for stop sign violations.

989,"A recent report by the Connecticut Racial Profiling Prohibition Project found racial and ethnic disparities for motor vehicle stops in several police departments throughout the state. The authors of the report collected and analyzed mounds of data relating to traffic stops throughout the state. One piece of data they paid particular attention to was for disparities in motor vehicle stops of minorities compared to minority populations in areas. Data was from Oct. 1, 2013 to Sept. 30, 2014. Authors noted the findings were indicative of racial and ethnic bias but, in the absence of a formal investigation, cannot be considered comprehensive evidence. You cant measure what you cant count, said David mcGuire, staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union of Connecticut. This information confirms that racial bias is a reality on the states highways and roads. Now that we can pinpoint problem areas, it is incumbent upon police departments to recognize and correct the bias that is driving many of their traffic stops. Overall, the study found that 13.5 percent of motorists stopped were black and 11.7 percent were Hispanic. Although we find results at the state level, it is important to note that it is specific officers and departments that are driving these statewide trends, the authors wrote. Authors also worked under the Veil of Darkness methodology, which is a statistical technique. It infers that officers who want to profile are more likely to do it during daylight hours when they can better determine the race or ethnicity of motorists.  Granby Minority stops accounted for 9 percent of all Granby stops. The authors said that there are, sufficiently strong results to make a determination that these results indicate the presence of a significant racial and ethnic disparity that is occurring in Granby. Of all stops 5.66 percent were of black motorists, compared to Granbys black population over the age of 16, which is .92 percent.  Waterbury Waterbury police pulled over minorities in 64.8 percent of all stops. About 32 percent were Hispanic and 32 percent were black. The results of the post-stop analysis also indicated that minority motorists, as compared to their Caucasian counterparts, were being searched more frequently relative to the rate at which they were found with contraband, the authors said. Waterbury also had the highest search rate for stops at 28.8 percent. State Police Troop C The troop made 15.2 percent minority stops. The results of the post-stop analysis also indicated that minority motorists, as compared to their Caucasian counterparts, were being searched more frequently relative to the rate at which they were found with contraband, the authors noted. Troop C covers 10 towns, five of which have resident trooper programs, including Mansfield. Shift determinations are made by towns and not state police for the majority of resident troopers. The interrelationship of these staffing patterns with overall Troop C operations is one of the factors that will be considered when further investigating the Troop C data for the source of the statistical disparity, authors said. State Police Troop H The troop was observed to make 37.5 percent minority stops, 13.5 percent Hispanic and 22.5 percent black. Although the post-stop analysis could not be conducted due to an insufficient sample of vehicular searches, the analysis using the Veil of Darkness produced sufficiently strong results to make a determination that these results indicate the presence of a significant racial and ethnic disparity that is occurring in State Police H, the authors said. The results of these analyses indicate that further investigation into the source of the observed statistical disparity is warranted. Other departments specifically mentioned Seven departments showed that stop data exceeded disparity thresholds in three out of four benchmark areas, as well as a majority of 12 possible measure. Departments in this category include: Wethersfield, Hamden, Manchester, New Britain, Stratford, Waterbury and East Hartford.  An additional five departments exceeded disparity threshold levels in three of four benchmarks and six of the 12 possible measures. They include: Meriden, New Haven, Newington, Norwich and Windsor.",0,8,5
990,"A Pennsylvania man has been sentenced to more than seven years in prison for his role in a kidnapping and jewelry store robbery in Fairfield in 2013. Jeffrey Houston, 30, of Allentown, Penn., also received three years of supervised release following the 90-month prison sentence, U.S. States Attorney Deirdre M. Daly announced in a press release. Houston was part of a group that stormed into a Gravel Street apartment in Meriden and bound four people on April 11, 2013, according authorities. Houston, Kasam Hennix, William Davis and Christopher Gay were all wearing masks and gloves and two were armed with handguns. The victims were bound with duct tape and their heads were covered with pillowcases, towels and jackets. Houston, Hennix and Davis then forced two of the victims into a victims vehicle and drove to Lenox Jewelers in Fairfield, where the two victims worked. Timothy Forbes traveled to Fairfield in a separate vehicle, and Gay remained in the Meriden apartment to guard the two other victims. After Houston, Hennix and Davis arrived at the Fairfield store, they stole jewelry, watches and loose diamonds with a total replacement value of more than $3 million, Daly wrote in the press release. They then fled in the victims car, leaving the two victims bound inside the store. Houston, Hennix and Davis abandoned the victims vehicle and got into Forbess vehicle. One of the defendants called Gay to advise him that they had successfully carried out the robbery and that he should leave the apartment. The defendants then fled the state. The five defendants were arrested in May 2013. Investigators determined that Houston, Forbes and Gay had traveled from Pennsylvania to Connecticut on several occasions in the weeks prior to the robbery in order to track the victims movements between Lenox Jewelers in Fairfield and their residence in Meriden. In addition, Forbes and Gay placed a GPS on one of the victims vehicles in an effort to make it easier to track him. On Dec. 8, 2015, Houston pleaded guilty to one count of interference with commerce by robbery and one count of use of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence. Forbes, of Allentown, Hennix, of Easton, Pa., Davis, of Allentown, and Gay, of the Bronx, N.Y., also pleaded guilty to federal charges. On April 17, 2015, Davis was sentenced to 176 months in prison; on January 27, 2016, Gay was sentenced to 102 months in prison, and, on February 8, 2016, Hennix was sentenced to 171 months of imprisonment.

993,"Meriden, CT - Ted Hakey Jr., 48, was sentenced Friday to six months in prison, followed by three years of supervised release, for firing shots into the Baitul Aman Mosque in Meriden in November, announced United States Attorney Deirdre M. Daly. Hakey, a Meriden resident who has been living out on bond and with his mother in Shelton, had hoped to avoid jail time, in part because he had worked hard to get members of the mosque to forgive him. Those members, in fact, had appealed to U.S. District Judge Michael P. Shea not to sentence him to prison. We all have a right to worship freely and without fear of violence, and individuals who commit hateful, divisive and violent acts against others need to know that a prison term will be the end result, said Daly in a statement. This is an appropriate sentence that balances the need for justice with the defendants genuine expressions of remorse and the victims plea for a sentence that didnt include jail time. Since the time of the shooting, the congregation of the Baitul Aman Mosque has turned this senseless and hateful crime into something positive – using their story as a way of raising awareness about the peaceful message of Islam. Rather than just letting themselves be victims, they took a stand, reached out to the defendant, and offered him forgiveness and reconciliation. Their generosity of spirit serves as a role model for all of us. I thank the FBI, ATF, Connecticut State Police and Meriden Police Department whose superb efforts not only solved a hate crime, but also helped both heal and empower the victims in this case and the broader Muslim community in Connecticut. Hakey was ordered to report to prison on August 15. He had faced the possibility of incarceration of eight to 14 months. During the sentencing proceeding, Dr. Mohammed Qureshi, the president of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, spoke on behalf of the Baitul Aman Mosque congregation, discussing the congregations interactions with Hakey Jr. after his arrest. Dr. Queshi highlighted how remorseful Hakey Jr. genuinely appeared to be, and while Judge Shea said he found the congregations appeal to be rare and inspiring, he believes the sentence could be a deterrent to similar acts in the future. In a drunken rage in the hours after the terrorist attacks in Paris last fall, Hakey Jr. fired four rounds from a high-powered rifle at the mosque, damaging walls and part of the facilitys kitchen. No one was inside at the time. Added Patricia M. Ferrick, Special Agent in Charge of the New Haven Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, This case highlights how law enforcement, the judicial system and our community working together can affect positive social change. This incident should serve as an educational tool and illustrate to everyone that ignorance and hate should never prevail. According to Daly, court documents and statements made in court: The case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Connecticut State Police and the Meriden Police Department.",1,3,2

Middletown Police responded to an East Main Street address at about 2:50 p.m. on June 25 on the report of a threatening incident. The resident told police that she was in her front yard with her 10-year-old grandson when a man named Dennis was walking down the other side of the road as he usually does because he lives nearby on Andrew Street, according to the police report.

Executive Director Pamela Hayes said that the association was looking to identify actual driving populations because many of the departments singled out for further review are next to a larger and more metropolitan city. Monroe Police Chief John Salvatore told Patch that the department was concerned with the findings of the report, and will work to compare the information to its own data. He also questioned the validity of the estimated driving population used in the reports, which he said does not accurately reflect the driving population in Monroe. Salvatore also said that Department staff have set up a meeting with the reports authors to share data. We are concerned with their findings and inferences. I believe our personnel are well trained, supervised and apply the law impartially, but the motor vehicle stop records are being reviewed and analyzed, Salvatore said. I, and most chiefs I speak with, do not believe the estimated driving population (EDP) used by the authors of this report accurately reflects the actual driver demographics using the roadways in town, particularly the inter-town operators on our busiest state routes who neither reside or work in Monroe. This EDP results in flawed data and inaccurate findings. Police chiefs are not the only ones skeptical or critical of the census based formula used by the IMRP.

Penn Racial Profiling Prohibition Act, requires the state to submit an annual report to the Governor and General Assembly to review the prevalence and disposition of traffic stops and complaints in Connecticut. Over the past fifteen years, racial profiling has been recognized as an issue of national, state, and local concern facing law enforcement agencies, William Dyson, Chair of the project wrote in the report. The state of Connecticut released their report in September 2014 of traffic stop data from information collected October 1, 2013 through May 31,2014. According to the report, Connecticuts requirement for police agencies to collect and report traffic stop information is the most extensive of its kind anywhere in the country. There are 2.54 million Connecticut residents who are of driving age or older. During that time frame there were 366,000 traffic stops across the state. The language that police agencies used to describe ethnicity and background information of traffic stops in their report is Blacks, Whites, and Hispanic, rather than African American and Caucasian. Blacks account for 8 percent of the population and were pulled over 14 percent of the time, while Hispanics account for 10 percent of Connecticuts population and were pulled over about 12 percent of all traffic stops. In Monroe there is a population of 14,822 residents 16 or older. There were 2,026 traffic stops in Monroe from October 1, 2013 through May 31,2014. Whites account for 97 percent of the population, Blacks, 0.54 percent and Hispanics, 3.92 percent. According to the report, Blacks were stopped 6.32 percent or 128 times and Hispanics were stopped 5.68 percent or 103 times. Photo: State of Connecticut Traffic Stop Data report.",0,8,5
1007,"The state Department of Correction has agreed to serve an inmate at Corrigan-Radgowski Correctional Institution in Montville something other than fish when it comes up on the prison menu after the inmate asked for help from the animal-rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, The Day of New London reported. The inmate — Howard W. Cosby — enlisted PETAs help after he requested a vegetarian diet as a practicing Buddhist and the DOC balked, claiming fish was not a meat. PETA wrote a letter that asserted, in part, that fish have thoughts, interests and a central nervous system. According to The Day, Deputy Warden Giuliana Mudano recently wrote PETAs attorneys to say the state would give Cosby a nutritionally adequate substitute whenever fish would appear in his menu cycle. Cosby was arrested for sexually assaulting a teenager in Bridgeport in 2002, convicted in 2004 and sentenced to 20 years in prison. Were very pleased that (the warden) has acceded to Mr. Cosbys legally grounded religious demands and acknowledged that fish arent swimming vegetables, said attorney Jeff Kerr, general counsel to PETA, in The Day story. Prison officials should certainly encourage an inmates adherence to the principles of nonviolence in all forms, including regarding his or her diet. What do you think? Should prisons cater to inmates dietary requests based on religion? Tell us in the comments.",0,8,5
1008,"In the hour Montville Patch spent with School Resource Officer Karen Moorehead at Montville High School, dozens of students either shouted in the door their hellos and whats ups, or stopped by for a quick chat, or some food (I have peanuts, she told them), and a couple came to unload, vent and one, weep. I totally love this job. I absolutely love it, and as she was about to share a story, her phone buzzed. A situation was brewing: a kid who she said last year she had to pull a Taser on because of a violent outburst but who is doing amazing so far this year was at home refusing to go to school and his parent had called police to help her.  She told the other officer on the line to keep her posted. Love you, Moorehead, a girl shouts from the hallway. She decided to stop and tell the police officer about a fellow student that said something inappropriate to her; she was in tears. Moorehead comforted her and said shed speak to the student. A minute later, another student stops and peeks in: Hey Moorehead.  I have something for you. Ill come by later. And a steady stream of kids, changing classes so the halls were full, made quick pit stops. Some kids who may have no issues troubling them, or problems at home, but many do. Yeah, I do spend my day putting out fires, she says as she opens a drawer with a file devoted to letters and notes from kids. And the walls of her office are filled with quotations that kids write using colorful Sharpie markers. Last year Facebook issues were big but its always things like boyfriend and girlfriend problems, but also some ugly stuff like threats via text, Moorhead says. Shes been the SRO for two years and was previously the DARE officer and worked with kids in Kindergarten through 7th grade. A lot of kids have major (problems) at home and that affects what happens in school. My job is to help them, to be there for them. But shes still a cop. Her phone rings again. The parent of the boy refusing to come to school has just called police and screaming could be heard in the background. Lets go, she says and in seconds were out the door on the way to the police cruiser parked outside. Moorehead meets other police officers at the home and within about 10 minutes, she has the boy outside with his backpack and, albeit begrudgingly, has agreed to come to school. Moorehead tries to get to the bottom of the reason he put up such a fight.  He is in a beef with another boy, something hes trying to avoid but not at the expense of looking weak. She handles him well and by the time were back at the school, hes calm and willing to try and avoid problems, especially at school. Youre having an amazing year. Id hate to see that go down the drain, she tells him. He responds with an Uh-hum. But somehow, one gets the impression hes hearing her. My best days and my worst days are probably the same. I mean if a kid that doesnt know me comes in and tells me something horrific, tragic and I end up helping, well thats good because I got through. The phone rings and she takes the call but at the same time saying hey to kids passing by. One says hey back but she stops him. Whats that in your hand, she asks. A (hall) pass, the boy with multi-color hair and funky stars and stripes pants topped with a studded vest. Right, okay except the hall passes are blue. She invites him in her office and they get to the bottom of it; he admits to fudging the time and date on the pass. Lets keep working on this no skipping classes thing, she says. Yeah, I guess we should. Download the movie",0,8,5

Guilford Police will be hosting and participating in educational seminars on this topic too in an effort to increase awareness and educate citizens, police said. Parents and educators are also encouraged to contact the Guilford Police Department Crime Prenvention Unit at 203-453-8061 for information on internet safety. While law enforcement will continue to investigate crimes perpetrated against our most vulnerable; parents and families have a responsibility to educate themselves and to have open and frank discussions with their children about the dangers they face. These dangers are real. Lets work together to ensure that no more children fall victim to these dangerous predators, Guilford Police said in a statement.

1015,"The following is the New Haven Police Departments account, written by Officer David B. Hartman, of the rescue of a distraught woman from the ledge of a 16-story high-rise apartment building on Sunday, July 30, 2017. Below is body cam video from Off. Alex Rivera of the final moments of the rescue: On Sunday, 30 July, 2017, at 12:25 PM, Firefighters and Officers Yonick Crawford, Jason Jemiola and Paul Cavalier were dispatched to the Madison Towers at 111 Park Street. A dispatcher let the responding cops know there was an emotionally disturbed woman on the roof of the sixteen story apartment high-rise. An eagle-eyed Yale Police dispatcher saw the call on the screen and let YPD officers in the area know. A firefighter made the first contact. A crowd of on-lookers had gathered on the ground below. The officers could see the woman above as they entered the building. TO THE ROOFOfficers Crawford and Jemiola made their way up. Yale University Police Sergeant Dan Rainville and Officer Alex Rivera had arrived moments earlier and had begun talking with the woman. A chain-link fence surrounded the perimeter of the roof. There was just enough of the available ledge for the woman to stand. She was in clear distress and on the outside of the fence. Her heals were perched at the edge as she faced inward. The distraught woman is twenty-four years old. She is not a resident nor was she a visitor at Madison Towers. She spotted the cautiously approaching emergency medical personnel and officers and yelled at them to stay back. She was drinking merlot from a bottle. She told the officers that she wanted to end her life. She said she would jump.Responding to what they were hearing, they pleaded with her not to jump. The woman was, at some moments, holding on to the fence by a finger or two. Occasionally, shed lean backward with nothing between her and the pavement below. The YPD officers told her they wanted to talk with her. They wanted to better understand what she was going through. They told her they were there to listen to her. YPD Sergeant Rainville and Officer Alex Rivera begged her to come closer to the fence and at least to hold on to it. Rivera, a trained Hostage Negotiator, listened as much as he talked. He allowed her to tell her story. She told him shed argued with her husband, she gone through difficult times with work and was done with life. He encouraged her to think of those that care about her, those that would suffer in this world without her. After several frightening stumbles, Officer Rivera persuaded her to hold on to the fence. HUSBAND & WIFE OFFICERS INCH CLOSEROfficer Elsa Berrios, the only female on the roof besides the distressed woman, arrived with the rookie officer she was training, Randy Billups. Officer Jemiola saw her approaching and asked the woman if talking to her would make her feel more comfortable. She agreed. The woman allowed Officer Berrios to get close enough to talk with her. Cautiously, she inched forward to the woman on the precarious ledge. They spoke for a while, their conversation switching from English to Spanish – back and forth. They spoke in whichever language seemed to comfort the woman. Me brinco, said the woman – slang Spanish for Ill jump. Then she chugged the remainder of a bottle of wine. As they spoke, the woman reached into her bag and took out a can of beer. She fumbled. The can dropped and the woman reached for it. She stumbled but didnt fall. Meanwhile, on the ground, NHPD Sergeant Terrence McNeil was busy trying to gather information on what had led up to the situation playing out above. He wasable to reach an acquaintance of the woman. Her phone number was radioed to Officer Jemiola. The woman said shed be eager to speak with her friend but wouldnt come close enough to Officer Berrios to take the phone. Perhaps she was worried theyd have attempted to grab her. Were sisters… hermanas, said Berrios.We are all tired… we all have bad days, she said. It was then that Officer Elvin Rivera (Officer Berrios husband) arrived with the rookie officer he was training, Officer Stephanie James. He called to the woman, Mamá! Officer Elvin Rivera started talking with the woman as his wife had done – in both English and Spanish. Their conversation seemed all over the place. They spoke of religion and other things. The woman seemed comfortable talking with Rivera. The woman mentioned her feet were on fire due to the sunbaked tar roof. Officer Berrios suggested they get her some ice. She asked Officer Crawford to find some. THE ICE ARRIVEDAt this point, the conversations with the woman had been going on for close to an hour. There were not many moments of true clarity. This was a tense and emotional rollercoaster for those involved. Compassionate and sometimes frantic pleas punctuated the conversations as the team off officers at the center of the roof and those on the ground strategized their next moves. Truth be told, there werent any sensible strategies. Nothing would have worked other than what they were doing – talking. The ice the woman had requested had arrived. Afraid to move much from their positions, the officers, in bucket-brigade fashion, passed the container to Officer Elvin Rivera. Hed inched it to the ledge where Officer Berrios had been earlier. At his position, the fence cut in a bit. The ledge where he stood was somewhat widerthan where the woman was. Yo te quiero, y Dios te quieres (I love you and God loves you), exclaimed Elvin Rivera. Enfrente en los ojos de Dios ven a mi. (In front of Gods eyes, come to me), he said with open arms. By this time, the woman was holding on to the fence. Shed lean back allowing a foot to dangle over the edge. An occasional finger-grip on the chain-link was all that prevented her fall. Officer Elvin Rivera pleaded with her and offered her the ice cubes. He needed her to get closer. With the ice in hand, he was able to coax hertoward him. Officer Rivera saw his chance. He reached out and grabbed her. She tried pushing away. She struggled violently. YPD Sergeant Rainville had removed his duty-belt in case he needed to climb the fence. The group of officer standing on the other side rushed forward. Rainville, Alex Rivera and Jemiola reached over the fence as Elvin Rivera held on to the womans arm for dear life. The officers got a better hold and pulled the woman to safety. Officers brought her to a waiting ambulance. On the ground, the back-story had developed. A man shed met earlier on Derby Avenue claimed hed asked her to hang out. They wandered downtown and snuck up to the roof. From there, he said, she made it to the edge. She told him she wanted to jump. The man wasnt able to stop her. He went down to the lobby andhad someone there phone police. There was PCP in the womans backpack. (PCP or Phencyclidine, also known as angel dust among other names, is a dissociative drug. Common side effects of PCP can include hallucinations, delirium and mania.) THE REUNIONOn Monday afternoon, the woman whod been on the edge days earlier was in the lobby at police headquarters. Shed come alone and wanted to meet Officer Rivera and the others whod saved her life. In the public lobby, they shared an emotional private moment. Theyd all been through a lot and were each thankful. There is no blueprint thatll assure success in saving a suicidal person from death. Whether influenced by drugs and alcohol, tormented by mental illness or trauma or those who suffer through immeasurable heartache, require unique approaches. Berrios and Rivera are two of the many NHPD & YPD members trained as CIT (Crisis Intervention Team) officers. To date, about eighty NHPD officers are CIT trained – with department-wide training set as a future goal. The departments Emergency Services Unit includes twelve specially trained Hostage Negotiators and relies on partnerships with a variety of groups that specialize in related matters. Those groups include the Peer SupportGroup, Employee Assistance Program, The Yale Child Study Center, CABLE (The Connecticut Association to Benefit Law Enforcement), area hospitals and CMHC (Connecticut Mental Health Center) as well as veterans and substance abuse organizations.

1016,"Targeting those with mental health issues ranging from depression to schizophrenia, Robert King allegedly lured more than a dozen young men into a sex trafficking operation which lasted more than two decades, according to court documents. Danbury police revealed Thursday that an investigation into a city-based sex trafficking ring has resulted in the arrests of three men who participated in the scheme. Court documents show that King was the ringleader of the operation, delivering young men to high-paying clients in a sex-for-money scheme. Police also arrested well-known Glastonbury businessman Bruce J. Bemer, 63, and William Trefzger, 71, of Westport, who were identified as clients by King, court documents allege. READ ALSO: Im just a gay guy trying to help people, King, 50, allegedly said to police at the time of his arrest on Aug. 13. Upon his arrest, King told investigators he only delivered the young men to clients during interviews. Arrest affidavits allege King would identify young men with mental health needs and disorders and befriend them with promises of work, money and necessities. The victims would hang out around Kings trailer located near the Danbury Fair Mall for a period of time. Victims told police King would offer them drugs such as heroin and cocaine in order to build up a debt. When victims were unable to pay King back, he offered them a way out through sex work, according to court documents. Clients would have King deliver the victims to them, and sometimes they would travel to his Miry Brook Road trailer for sex. They would pay the victim between $200 and $250 for sex, and King would get $50 of that price. Bemers attorney John Droney told Patch he could not make a substantive comment at this time, but said he is in the process of investigating the people who are making the charges. The charges are very serious and troubling, said Droney.I am in the process of investigating those who are making these charges, and will be able to comment further once that is complete. Patch has yet to determine who is representing King and Trefzger, but will reach out for comment when we do. Through their investigation, detectives identified 15 victims of the ring. Two of the victims had conservators appointed for them. The ages of the victims was not expressly described in the documents. Victims were identified as having a variety of mental health disorders, some being regarded as incapable of living on their own. Two of the victims were on probation and some lived in group homes. Court records and media reports paint a bizarre picture of Kings relationship with the young men. The News Times reports several neighbors at the mobile home park described King as having a nasty temper. Neighbors also reported loud music often coming from his trailer and boys coming in and out, often believed to be high on drugs. One neighbor described to the publication that one of the young men was seen running around like he was pretending to be a bird. One victim told investigators he met King while he was searching dumpsters for bottles. King struck up a conversation and befriended him before offering him a place to stay. He later introduced the young man to cocaine, which led to him building up a debt, and then to Bemer. Another recounted an incident in which he was suffering from an overdose and said King continued to drive from Waterbury to Torrington while the victim was overdosing. The man described Kings actions as demonstrating an extreme indifference to (the victims) life and resulted in the near death and overnight hospitalization of (the victim), court records allege. Two of the 15 victims identified in the investigation are no longer living, according to court records. During a search of Kings home, investigators found a shrine to one of the victims who was killed in a car crash in 2009. Both King and another victim told police they believed the young mans death was a suicide. Court records show King connected victims with at least eight wealthy clients in Connecticut and Massachusetts. He referred to both Bemer and Trefzger were identified as clients in the investigation. Bemer owns the New London-Waterford Speedbowl, New England Motor Sports and Glastonbury-based Bemer Petroleum. During an interview with police, Bemer said he has known King for 20 to 25 years and was delivering kids or boys to him for sexual services. Bemer referred to the victims as kids or boys during the interview but told investigators that all were over the age of 18. He further told investigators he stopped having sex with one of the victims because he got too old, according to the arrest affidavit. He allegedly told police that King brought him eight to 10 boys for sex, and he would pay between $200 to $250 per encounter. Victims told police that he would have them delivered to his home, hotel or office. Trefzger, a Westport resident who was sentenced in 2010 for touching another man in a sexual manner, admitted to his involvement as well as knowing that one of the victims had mental problems that caused hospitalization, according to the affidavit. According to Danbury police, both are charged with patronizing a trafficked person and are being held on a $500,000 cash-only bond. Police say additional arrests are expected in the case.

He also noted that the town is located in the corridors of several major state roads including Rte. 25 and I-84 and connects upper and lower Fairfield county.

1022,"In a bizarre twist of events, the owner of the Rooster Wine and Liquor Store on South Main Street in Newtown was charged with staging an armed robbery and a fire at his own establishment, police said. Scott Young, 39, of Southington faces multiple charges including arson, insurance fraud and criminal mischief after he was arrested on an outstanding warrant following a lengthy investigation. At the time of the incident on Jan. 21, Young told police that two suspects had robbed the store, set it on fire and painted swastikas on the rear door of the building. Lt. Aaron Bahamonde told Patch that numerous pieces of evidence including the spray painting led officers to believe the incident was staged. Certain evidence with the spray painting indicated that this might be a staged scene, said Bahamonde. Much more evidence forensic and physical evidence led us to believe he was the perpetrator in this crime. Youngs motives for the incident are still under investigation by police. The fact that Mr. Young used racial epithets and symbolism to cover up a crime was extremely disturbing to not only the community, but all the agencies involved, said Police Chief James Viadero in a statement.Such an incident unnerves the community and we are thankful we could bring the incident to a successful resolution and put everyones concern at ease. Young told police that two suspects had entered the store, one of whom brandished a handgun. He told police that the suspects later started a fire in the rear of the building and sprayed two swastikas and a racial slur on the back door of the building. Police said that investigators had been working endlessly to prepare an arrest warrant for Young. He was charged with arson in the first degree, insurance fraud, criminal mischief in the first degree, three counts of reckless endangerment in the first degree, providing a false statement in the second degree and interfering with an officer. Young was held on a court-set bond of $100,000. Editors Note: This story was posted earlier this week. Here it is again in case you missed it. Image via Google Earth Screenshot",1,0,1

1029,"Updated at 1 p.m. on Friday Earlier today the told East Haven Patch that Mayor Maturo would not be making any additional comments on this cases newest developments. ORIGINAL STORY Citing a need to find justice for the racial profiling she alleges led to her sons death, Emma Jones will file an appeal with the United States Supreme Court in an effort to continue to move forward the wrongful death lawsuit she brought against the town for the by an East Haven Police officer. I believe that I must — that I dont have a choice in the matter — that I absolutely must continue to cry out, to the legal system to act on both its moral and legal obligation to right the very wrong that I know that has been done to my son, my family and this community, Jones told reporters during a press conference at her s New Haven office late this afternoon. Jones said she stood before thousands of people in 1997 and declared that but for racial profiling my son Malik would be alive. She added that she also vowed at that time to fight for righteousness and justice. Not only in the case for Malik, but for all humanity. And to try right the wrongs that I saw was widespread in East Haven, she said. So today I am here to try to reaffirm that statement. Federal Appeals Court Ruling Todays announcement from Jones comes after the the Town of East Haven is not liable for her sons shooting. The decision — which found there was insufficient evidence to hold East Haven liable — overturned a lower courts ruling in October 2010 that . The town of that 2010 ruling, which is what led to Wednesdays decision by the 2nd Circuit court. When asked about what her feelings were regarding yesterdays ruling in favor of the town, Jones said they were unspeakable. She said she feels racial profiling existed prior to the taking of my son Malik Jones life. And as a matter of fact today as we sit here. And Jones added that the U.S. Justice Department referred to her lawsuit as part of into alleged . I am very confident that I was right then, and that I am right now, Jones said of her case. Its A Long Shot Rosen said they will now have 90 days from yesterday (Aug. 1) to file the necessary paperwork to petition the U.S. Supreme Court to hear their appeal. When asked by reporters if he felt it would be a long shot for the case to be among the few selected each session to be heard by the nations top justices, Rosen replied that every case in the Supreme Court is a long shot. Every time somebody tries to right a wrong, its a long shot, he said. Clearly a Wrong That Was Done Toward the end of the press conference, Jones was asked her response to that the federal appeals courts ruling was a victory. She responded that no matter the latest legal verdict, the shooting death of her son was clearly a wrong that was done. And so I cant define what the mayor believed to be a victory for him. But when there is an injustice or a wrong and it causes loss of life or pain and suffering to other human beings, Jones said. I have a difficult time encapsulating that as a victory in any level. Im speaking for myself, I cant speak for anyone else. The Mayors Office did not immediately return a late afternoon phone call and email for comment from East Haven Patch. ________________________________________________________________________________________ Receive updates to this story and other East Haven breaking news: Sign up for the daily newsletter, like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.________________________________________________________________________________________ (Editors Note: Additional reporting and video were added to this post at 9:30 p.m.) Download the movie Download the movie Download the movie",1,0,0

Incident activity included: Canelli reported that the vehicle maintenance costs for April were just less than $2,900, noting that majority of that cost was to replace the transmission on car 11, which has 154,000 miles on it. Were never going to get that money out of that car, said Police Commission Vice Chairman Dave Palumbo. Id just hate to see the numbers [for vehicle repairs] going the other way again [after going down after ].

He reported that he had not yet received a response from the Town Managers office. Several commissioners voiced concern, agreeing the area was in need of repair with Palumbo saying, Ill provide the concrete if Public Works will do the demo and install the new railing. -- The NBPD received a letter from the Town Managers office concerning Officer Leonard Popolizios upcoming retirement, which is effective July 13. I know the process–I dont need a letter, said Canelli. I answered him in an appropriate way saying the Commission is well aware of what we have to do.

1033,"From the North Haven Fire Department: Chief Paul Januszewski and the North Haven Fire Department are issuing public guidelines, advice and warnings after officials reviewed the latest fire danger report from the federal government. The U.S. Fire Administration Fire Risk Report analyzes data from fires reported in all 50 states to warn fire departments and the public about dangerous and deadly trends. In 2015, the most recent year with full data available for the report, 3,360 deaths and 15,700 injuries in the U.S. were caused by fires. Key Findings: While aggressive fire prevention and educational programs have resulted in children having a lower risk of dying or being injured by a fire, kids remain at risk. There are many things that parents can do to further reduce the risk: The report notes the risk among the elderly, who are killed in fires at a rate of 2.7 times that of the rest of the population. Poor housing maintenance, a lack of working smoke detectors, substandard apartment housing, and declining health and senses among some seniors are all contributing factors nationwide. The North Haven Fire Department offers a free service where they will inspect a house or apartment to ensure that exits are clear, smoke and carbon monoxide detectors are working, and there are no imminent dangers in the house. Poverty is also a key risk factor. The report states: Housing for the poor is often substandard. Typically, such housing has not been well-maintained. Building structures can be compromised, and building systems, such as electrical and mechanical, are often outdated, inadequate or not operational. The result is a higher likelihood of damaged or fraying electrical wiring, faulty heating, and worn-out household appliances. Heating in particular represents an elevated fire danger to older adults. The North Haven Fire Department is committed to working with community organizations, religious groups, civic associations or any other group that can help spread the word about fire prevention. The department also has printed fire safety materials available from the U.S. Fire Administration in a variety of languages. Preventing death and injury by fire is the business of everyone in the community, and the North Haven Fire Department is a willing partner with any family, individual, or organization who is interested in improving safety, Chief Januszewski said. I am grateful for the resources of the U.S. Fire Administration, as this annual report goes a long way toward our mission of preventing the loss of life and property from fire.

The annual VOD analysis indicated a statistically significant disparity in the rate that Hispanic motorists were stopped during daylight relative to darkness. Within the inter-twilight window, the odds that a Hispanic motorist was stopped during daylight was 1.6 times larger than the odds during darkness. These results were statistically significant at the 99 percent level and robust to the inclusion of a variety of controls, officer fixed-effects, and a restricted sample of moving violations. In a statement, Norwich Police Chief Patrick Daley told the Norwich Bulletin that the numbers were an anomaly, particularly as it related to Hispanic drivers.

An in-depth follow-up analysis will be done on Berlin, Monroe, Newtown, Norwich, Ridgefield, Darien and State Police Troop B departments after some disparities were noted. The departments are invited to share in the analysis. ...racial and ethnic disparities in any traffic stop analysis do not, by themselves, provide conclusive evidence of racial profiling, researchers wrote in the report. Statistical disparities do, however, provide significant evidence of the presence of idiosyncratic data trends that warrant further analysis. In 2016 the Connecticut Police Chiefs Association released a press release that said to date no police chief has been informed that their department or officers have engaging in biased based policing from the reports findings. Executive Director Pamela Hayes said that the association was looking to identify actual driving populations because many of the departments singled out for further review are next to a larger and more metropolitan city. State Police Troop A conducted 19,136 stops during the studys time period. How the stop ended: Here is a breakdown of reasons for a stop in Troop A communities rounded to the nearest percent Of Troop As 19,136 traffic stops, 69 percent involved White motorists, 13 percent Black motorists, and 15 percent were Hispanic motorists, the report states.

1043,"A recent report by the Connecticut Racial Profiling Prohibition Project found that Troop A, which includes Southbury and Oxford, conducted 19,544 traffic stops from Oct. 1, 2014 through Sept. 30, 2015. The top reason a State Trooper in Troop A pulls someone over is for speeding. Out of nearly 20,000 stops, speeding accounted for 25.7 percent of all stops followed by registration violations, 18.1 percent, moving violations, 10.78 percent, cell phone infractions, 6.9 percent, and 4 percent seat belt. Troop A ranked No. 7 in the state for stopping people for registration offenses. If youre stopped by a State Trooper expect a ticket. In 2015, Troop A issued a ticket 63 percent of the time, which was near the top of the state. In 2015, Troop A issued verbal warnings 21 percent of the time and written warnings 6.7 percent of the time. Out of 19,544 stops, searches were conducted 2.7 percent of the time. The report states that in Connecticut 14.1 percent of 585,000 traffic stops between Oct. 1, 2014 and Sept. 30, 2015 involved black residents and 12.5 percent involved Hispanic motorists. Traffic stops are more likely during daylight hours. Five municipal departments and one state police troop in Connecticut were identified to exhibit a statistically significant racial or ethnic disparity that may indicate the presence of racial and ethnic bias including: Bloomfield, New Milford, Norwalk, West Hartford, Wethersfield and State Police Troop H. Additionally, 25 police officers throughout Connecticut were deemed to be more likely to pull people over based on race, the report notes.",0,8,5

Clark, 58, of Woodbury, was sentenced to 45 months of imprisonment, followed by three years of supervised release, for stealing more than $1.8 million from the estate of an Oxford woman who died in 2010, federal authorities announced in a prepared statement Wednesday evening. According to court documents and statements made in court, Miriam S. Strong of Oxford died on July 2, 2010. At the time of her death, Strong had a will, which left money, property and other items to a list of individuals, the Town of Oxford, the State of Connecticut and several religious and other charitable entities. The will also called for the creation of a scholarship fund for college-bound students from Oxford. Clark drafted the will as Strongs attorney and served as a witness to Strongs execution of the will. The will named Clark and another individual as co-executors. The investigation revealed that, during the course of the administration of the will, Clark took more than $1.8 million from Strongs estate for his own use, federal officials said. Clark will be ordered to make restitution to the Connecticut Client Security Fund, which has reimbursed Miriam Strongs estate. Clark was arrested on a federal criminal complaint on May 21, 2015.

1047,"Update, 2:45 p.m. Peter M. Clark, 57, of Woodbury, was arrested Thursday on a federal criminal complaint charging him with stealing more than $1.8 million from the estate of an Oxford woman who died in 2010. According to the criminal complaint, Miriam S. Strong of Oxford died on July 2, 2010. At the time of her death, Strong had a will, which left money, property and other items to a list of individuals, the Town of Oxford, the State of Connecticut, and several religious and other charitable entities. The will also called for the creation of a scholarship fund for college-bound students from Oxford. Clark drafted the will as Strongs attorney and served as a witness to Strongs execution of the will. The will named Clark and another individual as co-executors. The investigation has revealed that, during the course of the administration of the will, Clark took at least $1.8 million from Strongs estate for his own use including purchasing a $3,928 all-terrain vehicle, paying his $914 power bill and a $2,000 check to his wife. The complaint charges Clark with one count of mail fraud, which carries a maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years. Clark was arrested this morning at his residence. He appeared before U.S. Magistrate Judge Sarah A.L. Merriam in New Haven and will be released after he posts a $500,000 bond that will be co-signed by family members. Oxford First Selectman George R. Temple said hes at a loss of words over the allegations against Clark. He betrayed his client. He betrayed his legal profession. His arrest will not bring the money back but justice will be done, Temple said. Temple reiterated his belief that Oxford will receive most of the funds back at a later time through the courts. The arrest is a good first step, Temple said, adding it will likely compel Clark to cooperate with federal authorities. Temple said there is no doubt the loss of money impacted the towns ability to purchase open space and has thrown into doubt future plans for a new Oxford Public Library. Temple said he remains committed to the library project. I had several sleepless nights over this, Temple said adding that the money also would have benefited Oxford students who were going to college. U.S. Attorney Deirdre Daly stressed that a complaint is only a charge and is not evidence of guilt. Charges are only allegations, and a defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. This matter is being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Connecticut State Police – Western District Major Crime Squad. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Sarah P. Karwan.  UPDATE 10:30 a.m. Thursday: U.S. Department of Justice officials confirmed Thursday morning that Peter M. Clark, 57, of Woodbury, was arrested today on a federal criminal complaint. He is scheduled to appear at 12:30 p.m. before U.S. Magistrate Judge Sarah A. L. Merriam in New Haven (courtroom #5). More details to come.  Original post from April 18 By Brian McCready, Patch Editor In March, Oxford First Selectman George R. Temple made the sobering announcement that $1.8 million was missing from the estate of deceased resident Miriam Strong. Oxford was named as a beneficiary of Strongs estate. Those funds had been earmarked for construction of a library, open space acquisition, and scholarships to benefit Oxford students, officials said at the time. In an interview last month week, Temple said the criminal investigation is ongoing but he vowed an arrest will be made. He also said in speaking with investigators, it looks good that Oxford will recoup most if not all of the missing money. He said the Bar Association has a fund it created for cases such as this one, where an attorney is accused of stealing funds. Temple said the Bar Association would cover most if not all the losses. In March upon the motion of the town of Oxford in Probate Court, Attorney Peter M. Clark of Woodbury was removed as executor of the Strong Estate, Temple said. He has been replaced by retired Probate Judge Clifford D. Hoyle. Clark has already resigned as an attorney, Temple said. When charges are officially filed it will be for first-degree larceny, Temple said. Temple said hes heard rumors as to what the missing money was spent on, but nothing definitive. Temple said hes uncertain what will happen to the Oxford Library in light of the missing funds. The library operates in a 3,000-square-foot space in the downstairs area of Town Hall, and plans called for a new 10,000-square-foot separate space. Temple said a third of the total funds needed for the library project were supposed to come from Strongs estate. Temple said while he is confident Oxford will receive most of the funds back, the future of the library project is still undecided. He said he is personally committed to seeing a library built in this town. Its a very worthy project, Temple said, adding hed like to bring the proposal to a town meeting.",0,8,5
1048,"The Valley Independent Sentinel is reporting that Former Oxford Tax Collector Karen Guillet, who is in prison for embezzling millions from the town, had her bid for parole denied Wednesday morning. She had a parole hearing at the Parole Board Office, 55 West Main St. Waterbury. Oxford First Selectman George R. Temple appeared before the board to oppose giving Guillet parole. Here are the remarks he gave to the board. Here is First Selectman George Temples full statement: As First Selectman of the Town of Oxford, I would like to state the towns position regarding Karen Guillets parole application. I have discussed this application with many people in the town. I feel that I polled a broad spectrum of political, social and ethnic backgrounds in formulating the position as stated today. The position of the Tax Collector is an elected position in Oxford. Mrs. Guillet was always re-elected by a wide majority and was in fact rarely opposed. She was a very popular person in town and was known to be the affluent beneficiary of a trust fund. She always drove a foreign sports car and was extremely well dressed. In fact, she would tell others that she wore shoes that cost her $1,000. No one really thought much of her bragging because the town believed she was independently wealthy and therefore could afford luxuries. The town had little or no control over the tax office and Mrs. Guillet would buy bagels for the independent auditors who only looked at her collection procedures and never questioned the actual dollars and cents. In the meantime Mrs. Guillet was always generous to all. She taught religion in church and was very generous to her political party. In short, most people liked, respected and trusted Mrs. Guillet. When she was finally caught, her assistant reported her to the first selectman. She admitted to stealing $3,600, but incredibly she was allowed to stay in her office for another six weeks. Many people in town became very hostile to her assistant and implied that she was in fact the thief. In a display of moral courage, her assistant stayed on and watched as Mrs. Guillet disposed of documents. Finally, after six weeks Mrs. Guillet resigned. Mrs. Guillet had an elaborate scheme involving what is called a suspense list. A suspense list is a list of taxes that would be uncollectible. Usually if someone dies and leaves no estate, their tangible property would be placed on the suspense list. If someone moved out of state and owed taxes, they would be put on a suspense list. They still owe the taxes, but we would probably have to write them off. Typically the suspense list would amount to some $20,000 to $40,000. When I took office, our suspense list was $10.2 million dollars. In order to determine the validity of our suspense list, the entire list was made public. Many residents were angry at being included as a tax delinquent. Many brought proof of payment into town hall. In fact the total amount that these so called delinquents, provided as conclusively proven to have paid was: $2,644,718, with more to come. To be sure, the town of Oxford totally investigated the tax collecting procedures in the past. The town was managed in a naïve, unprofessional manner. Such an atmosphere was ripe for the taking for a self-centered greedy thief. Enter Karen Guillet. To this date, we dont know the total amount stolen from us by this woman. Our finance director estimated that it was at least $4.2 million dollars over the past fifteen years. If that estimate is true and we average it out, if she is released in August…it would mean that she would only serve one month for every $262,500 she took from Oxford. Its a slap on the wrist for her….a slap in the face for Oxford. I am sure Mrs. Guillet has been an exemplary prisoner. At one time she was an exemplary citizen. When I think of the projects that could have been completed with the money she stole. It boils my blood! When we had to scrape up money for school security and playgrounds I think of her extravagant lifestyle. It is not a question of bitterness or revenge that motivates us to oppose Mrs. Guillets parole; it is a matter of justice for her betrayal of our trust. I thank you for your kind consideration.

Emergency crews responded. Karlak was pronounced dead on arrival. David J. Serra, of Southwick, Mass., was the driver of the truck. Ambulance crews brought him to Waterbury Hospital, where he was treated for minor injuries, according to the report. The weather was cloudy and the roadway was wet at the time of the accident, the report states. The exact location is listed as Southford Road, about two-tenths of a mile south of the Burma Road intersection in Southbury, which is close to the Oxford-Southbury town line. The Southbury Resident Troopers Office is investigating the accident. Anyone who witnessed it is asked to contact Officer Brian McKirryher at 203-264-5912. The accident remains under investigation as of the morning on Friday, Nov. 1. Friends are sharing memories of Karlak on the Facebook page of the Valley Independent Sentinel. Karlak was a religious missionary who studied at Youth With a Mission: University of the Nations in Denver, Colo., after graduating from Seymour High School in 2006. Pictures on her Facebook page show her working with children in Asia. The car that Karlak was driving is owned by Employment Options, a progressive social service agency based in Oxford that serves people with various disabilities and traumatic brain injuries.

One of the items was a swastika, and the other was racially biased, according to Gross email.

Over the past fifteen years, racial profiling has been recognized as an issue of national, state, and local concern facing law enforcement agencies, William Dyson, Chair of the project wrote in the report. The state of Connecticut released their report in September 2014 of traffic stop data from information collected October 1, 2013 through May 31,2014.

There are 2.54 million Connecticut residents who are of driving age or older. During that time frame there were 366,000 traffic stops across the state. The language that police agencies used to describe ethnicity and background information of traffic stops in their report is Blacks, Whites, and Hispanic, rather than African American and Caucasian. Blacks account for 8 percent of the population and were pulled over 14 percent of the time, while Hispanics account for 10 percent of Connecticuts population and were pulled over about 12 percent of all traffic stops. In Ridgefield there is a population of 17,410 residents 16 or older. There were 4,315 traffic stops in Ridgefield from October 1, 2013 through May 31,2014.

1058,"Written by Corey Fyke The state Department of Correction has agreed to serve an inmate at Corrigan-Radgowski Correctional Institution in Montville something other than fish when it comes up on the prison menu after the inmate asked for help from the animal-rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, The Day of New London reported. The inmate — Howard W. Cosby — enlisted PETAs help after he requested a vegetarian diet as a practicing Buddhist and the DOC balked, claiming fish was not a meat. PETA wrote a letter that asserted, in part, that fish have thoughts, interests and a central nervous system. According to The Day, Deputy Warden Giuliana Mudano recently wrote PETAs attorneys to say the state would give Cosby a nutritionally adequate substitute whenever fish would appear in his menu cycle. Cosby was arrested for sexually assaulting a teenager in Bridgeport in 2002, convicted in 2004 and sentenced to 20 years in prison. Were very pleased that (the warden) has acceded to Mr. Cosbys legally grounded religious demands and acknowledged that fish arent swimming vegetables, said attorney Jeff Kerr, general counsel to PETA, in The Day story. Prison officials should certainly encourage an inmates adherence to the principles of nonviolence in all forms, including regarding his or her diet. What do you think? Should prisons cater to inmates dietary requests based on religion? Tell us in the comments.",0,8,5
1059,"The FBI on Monday released its Hate Crime Statistics Report for 2016, and Rocky Hill was mentioned. The report is the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting Programs latest compilation about bias-motivated incidents throughout the nation. Submitted by 15,254 law enforcement agencies, the 2016 data provide information about the offenses, victims, offenders, and locations of hate crimes. Law enforcement agencies submitted incident reports involving 6,121 criminal incidents and 7,321 related offenses as being motivated by bias toward race, ethnicity, ancestry, religion, sexual orientation, disability, gender, and gender identity. The UCR Program does not estimate offenses for the jurisdictions of agencies that do not submit reports. Rocky Hill police participated and had one religion motivated incident in 2016, according to the report. Here is a national summary: Victims of Hate Crime Incidents Offenses by Crime Category Known Offenders In the UCR Program, the term known offender does not imply that the suspects identity is known; rather, the term indicates that some aspect of the suspect was identified, thus distinguishing the suspect from an unknown offender. Law enforcement agencies specify the number of offenders and, when possible, the race of the offender or offenders as a group. Beginning in 2013, law enforcement officers could also report whether suspects were juveniles or adults, as well as the suspects ethnicity when possible. Locations of Hate Crimes Law enforcement agencies may specify the location of an offense within a hate crime incident as 1 of 46 location designations. In 2016, most hate crime incidents (27.3 percent) occurred in or near residences/homes. More than 18 percent (18.4) occurred on highways/roads/alleys/streets/sidewalks; 9.9 percent occurred at schools/colleges; 5.7 percent happened at parking/drop lots/garages; and 3.9 percent took place in churches/synagogues/temples/mosques. The location was reported as other/unknown for 12.7 percent of hate crime incidents. The remaining 22.1 percent of hate crime incidents took place at other or multiple locations.

The bill, H.B. 5297, was introduced by Rep. J.P. Sredzinski (R-112th) of Monroe, and Klarides-Ditria says the proposal is gaining support throughout the General Assembly. As a wife of a police officer, I want to thank Rep. Sredzinski for proposing this bill and all of the other lawmakers who have introduced similar legislation, said Klarides-Ditria in a statement. The brave men and women who protect our streets should receive the utmost respect for putting their lives in harms way, and individuals who look to purposely injure public safety officials should receive severe penalties for their actions. Klarides-Ditrias district includes Derby, Seymour and Beacon Falls, and she urges residents and first responders interested in this bill to contact their State Representative or Senator to express their support. A full list of legislators can be found on the General Assemblys website, www.cga.ct.gov. Last year, the state of Louisiana became the first state in the nation to make it a hate crime for intentionally assaulting first responders.

Simsbury police officers recently participated in training on fair and impartial policing, reports the Hartford Courant. The training was recommended by the state after a report showed many police departments in Connecticut showed racial and ethnic bias when making traffic stops. Simsbury was not one of the 10 departments named, but chose to participate in the training anyway. The report showed that the percentage of minorities who were stopped for motor vehicle violations by police in the Farmington Valley exceeded that for the population as a whole in those communities. The training was attended by 30 local and state police officers, including officers from Simsbury, Farmington, Avon, Canton, Windsor, and Granby. The animal control officer for Avon and Canton also attended. In Simsbury, the population that is at least 16 years of age is 92.35 percent white, 3.57 percent Asian/Pacific Islander, 2.61 percent Hispanic, and 1.46 percent black. For the Simsbury Police Department, 90.44 percent of people stopped were white, 5.40 percent were black, 2.49 percent were Hispanic, and 1.18 percent were Asian/Pacific Islander.

1068,"Speeding is the reason Simsbury police officers give for almost 43 percent of their traffic stops — a higher percentage than all but nine of the other police departments and state police troops in Connecticut. Thats one of the many statistics in a recent report from the state Racial Profiling Prohibition Project of the Institute for Municipal and Regional Policy at Central Connecticut State University about traffic stops by police around the state. The Connecticut Traffic Stop and Data Analysis report looked at statistics for the 12-month period ending on Sept. 30, 2014 for 92 municipal police departments, 13 state police troops and various other police agencies with arrest powers — including state capitol police and some college campus police departments. Speed related was the description of 42.7 percent of traffic stops by Simsbury police. Other police departments with higher percentages were New Milford (63 percent — the highest percentage), Suffield, Portland, Southington, Newtown, Ridgefield, Guilford, Weston and Wolcott. Police departments having the lowest percentages of stops speed related were West Hartford (5.1 percent), Bridgeport (5 percent) and New London (3.4 percent). Altogether, Simsbury police officers made 3,281 traffic stops in the 12-month period. Other reasons for stops (in descending order): defective lights (10.8 percent), moving violation (8.7 percent), improper use of cell phone (8 percent), traffic signal (7.7 percent), stop sign (6.3 percent), display of plates (2.7 percent), registration (2.6 percent), traffic control signal (1.8 percent), seatbelt (1.5 percent), suspended license (0.4 percent), window tint (0.2 percent). A total of 8.1 percent were for other reasons. Statistics from Simsbury also showed:  Racial disparities in traffic stops Part of the reason for the report was to see if black and Hispanic drivers were stopped more frequently than other drivers. The report found that drivers from both groups were more likely than white drivers to be stopped during daylight hours than in darkness. People from minority groups were more likely to be searched after traffic stops not just in comparison with white drivers, but in comparison with the rate at which police found contraband (such as a drug packet or a gun without a permit). The study said that while it reported on statewide figures, specific officers and departments are driving these statewide trends. [...] The departments that were identified as having a statistically significant disparity are presumed to be driving the statewide results. Although it is possible that specific officers within departments that were not identified may be engaged in racial profiling, these behaviors were not substantial enough to influence the department level results. It is also possible that a small number of individual officers within the identified departments are driving the department level results. The report identified five local police departments in the state that exhibit a statistically significant racial or ethnic disparity that may indicate the presence of racial and ethnic violence. Those departments are in the Town of Groton, Granby, Waterbury, State Police Troop C, State Police Troop H. Twelve other departments had some statistical anomalies that seemed to justify further observation, the report said. Those departments are in Wethersfield, Hamden, Manchester, New Britain, Stratford, Waterbury and East Hartford, and to a lesser extent in Meriden, New Haven, Newington, Norwich and Windsor. Simsbury is not one of those departments — according to the report, the traffic stops made by Simsbury police were a smaller percentage of minority drivers than there are in a 30-mile radius of the town. (The report pointed out that the area minority population is only a vague indicator of how many drivers from minority groups are on a communitys roads.) A total of 7.72 percent of all stops in Simsbury involved black drivers. The report compared that percentage to the percent of black residents age 16 and over within 30 miles of the community where the stop took place. For Simsbury, according to the report, a total of 11.54 percent of the population within a 30 mile radius is black. The difference between those two figures is 3.82 percent of all traffic stops. A total of 1.46 percent of town residents aged 16 or over (of driving age, that is) are black. They accounted for 5.43 percent of all police stops. The state average is 0.42. Hispanics account for 2.61 percent of the town population but only 2.5 percent of the stops. A total of 3.12 percent of all stops in Simsbury involved Hispanic drivers, and the driving-age population for Hispanics within a 30-mile radius of Simsbury is 4.53 percent. The difference between those two figures is 1.14 percent of all traffic stops.",0,8,5

Riccardo DOrsainville, 50, was indicted by a Suffolk County Grand Jury last month, charged with one count of kidnapping and three counts each of poisoning, larceny over $250 and receiving stolen property, according to the Suffolk County District Attorneys office and Boston Police Department. DOrsainville is a Haitian national and convicted con man who remains in the U.S. despite attempts to deport him, reports The Boston Globe. He was not returned to Haiti because he is gay and could be subject to discrimination there, according to court records obtained by the paper. He was arraigned Wednesday in Suffolk Superior Court, where his bail was reduced from $250,000 to $100,000, the District Attorneys office said. DOrsainville did not appear in public view Wednesday, but shouted his plea into court, according to The Globe. Prosecutors cried foul Wednesday after DOrsainvilles defense counsel reportedly said the men he encountered may have been experiencing buyers remorse in reporting the crimes against them. The victims in this case were targeted because of their sexuality, drugged against their will, and robbed of their belongings.   To call their reaction buyers remorse is to suggest they bear responsibility for the crimes committed against them, which we find offensive, a statement from the district attorneys office said. Boston Police investigators said DOrsainville targeted gay men, setting up rendezvous with at least three men who took him to their Boston homes. While there with DOrsainville, the men passed out after drinking alcohol, investigators said. When they awoke, they realized that thousands of dollars worth of property was missing. Stolen items ranged from a tuxedo and designer neckties to rare and expensive paintings and sculptures, according to police.

I would like to acknowledge the great work of my detectives and prosecutors from the DAs office who worked very hard to get justice for these victims. The three incidents took place from March-April of 2013. One of the alleged victims met DOrsainville in a bar while the other two encounters were arraigned online. The suspect remained unknown until one of the victims mentioned the case to an acquaintance. Police say that the description of DOrsainville given to the acquaintance was similar to a person he knew was convicted of defrauding the Boston Veterans Affairs Research Institute, Inc. Police were able to get a photo identification thanks to the tip and Boston police detectives obtained a search warrant for DOrsainvilles home, recovering items stolen from the victims. DOrsainville was arraigned in February and has been held on $250,000 bail since. No court date has been scheduled.",1,4,0

Joseph Kukstis, 29, was charged with stalking via electronic means and held in custody pending an arraignment later Tuesday in federal court in Boston. Between September 2015 and about October 2017, Kukstis targeted the victim with an anonymous harassment campaign that was intended to cause — and did cause — the victim substantial emotional distress, U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling said in a statement. Lelling alleged Kukstis committed the following acts:  Lelling said Kukstis also sent himself harassing messages that he showed to the woman as a ruse to make it appear he was also a victim of the stalker. Then in January, Kukstis gave up and admitted to the woman he was indeed the stalker, Lelling said. Kukstis allegedly sent the woman an email that said, it was me the entire time, I hate myself for it. If convicted, Kukstis could face up to 5 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

1111,"Two Boston brothers are being held without bail after allegedly beating a homeless man and urinating on him in at a T stop early Wednesday morning. One of the brothers credits Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump with inspiring the attack, reports the The Daily Beast. Scott Leader, 38, and Steve Leader, 26, both of South Boston, were charged with multiple crimes, including assault and battery, assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, assault and battery for the purpose of intimidation because of national origin, open and gross lewdness, indecent exposure, disorderly conduct, disturbing the peace, and threatening to commit a crime, Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel F. Conley announced. Steve Leader was arraigned on an additional count of malicious destruction of property. They were ordered held in jail pending a dangerousness hearing scheduled for Sept. 3. Scott Leaders also saw his bail revoked on previous charges. He has served time for a hate crime against a Moroccan man, and he allegedly punched a Muslim man after the Boston Marathon bombings. Police say they received a call for assistance with an ongoing assault at the JFK/UMASS T station just after 12:30 a.m. Wednesday. Witnesses reported watching two men beating another man with a metal pole. They reportedly hit the 58-year-old homeless man repeatedly with a metal pole before walking away laughing. The witnesses followed the suspects after the attack, helping police find them. The victim was rushed to Boston Medical Center, where he was treated for a broken nose, serious bruising and other injuries. He later told police he awoke to the two men urinating on him. They then ripped off his sleeping bag and blankets and started going through his things before beating him with the pole, the victim told police. Even after being arrested, the brothers were still ready to fight, according to police reports. Steve Leader allegedly exposed his genitals to the troopers several times and urinated on the door and floor of the cell block. He allegedly stated that he would kick the [expletive] out of the troopers if he werent in the cell. Scott Leader, despite being read his Miranda rights, was not in the mood to remain silent, reports indicate. He reportedly told police he and his brother tuned up an illegal immigrant, and that this behavior was acceptable because the victim was homeless and Hispanic. That opinion, he says, matches with Donald Trumps platform. Donald Trump was right, all these illegals need to be deported, Scott Leader reportedly told police. Told of Leaders comments, The Daily Beast reports Trump invoke the passion of his followers. It would be a shame, Trump told the website. I will say that people who are following me are very passionate. They love this country and they want this country to be great again. They are passionate.

1112,"- A serial drunk driver who was once described as inherently evil by a retired Marblehead Police detective was given until March 28 by a Salem Superior Court judge to decide whether or not he will plead guilty on charges stemming from his most recent drunk driving arrest and go to prison for six years. Peter Anketell, 56, of Salem, was arrested last July after nearly hitting two pedestrians near the Speedway gas station on Derby Street. It was the 15th time he had been arrested for drunk driving since 1978. Anketells record, according to the Salem News, includes 10 convictions in Massachusetts, three in New Hampshire and an open case in Florida. When he was arrested last summer, he had just finished serving a 12- to 14-year prison sentence for a 2004 conviction on motor vehicle homicide while drunk. That conviction came after a 2002 crash in which Anketells girlfriend, 40-year-old Cynthia Wilson, was killed. When Salem Police arrested Anketell last year, retired Marblehead Police detective Marion Keating told CBS News Boston she was shocked to see a man she had helped send to prison in 2002 back behind the wheel. I hate to say it but hes inherently evil, Keating said. Keating also told CBS that after the crash Anketell tried to move Wilsons body to make it appear as if she had been driving. In his most recent arrest, Anketsell allegedly took his girlfriends Dodge Journey without permission. When the truck hit a curb and blew out a tire near the Speedway gas station, a man ran from the vehicle. Police found Anketsell in a nearby parking lot, smelling of alcohol and with a beer between his legs. Salem Superior Court Judge Timothy Feeley has proposed a sentence of six years followed by two years probation if Anketsell agrees to plead guilty. If he were to go to trial, he could face 4.5 years for the drunk driving charge, followed by sentence of 18 months for driving after his license was revoked for drunken driving.

1113,"Salem Police are looking for the person who used a light blue marker to draw a swastika on a pillar at the Salem Common bandstand last Thursday afternoon. The vandalism was reported on Sunday, according to Lt. Marc Berube, but surveillance tapes show it was drawn on Thursday around 1 p.m. Berube said the graffiti has since been removed by the Salem Department of Public Works. Whether it was undertaken with malicious intent or stupidity, this action needs to be condemned in the strongest possible terms, said Mayor Kim Driscoll in a statement. The very name of our community emanates from the Hebrew word for peace – Shalom, said Driscoll. In Salem, we strive to be a welcoming and inclusive city and in the wake of this incident we will continue our work with our community partners like Salems No Place for Hate Committee, the ADL, and others to continually educate, advocate and work toward that goal.

1114,"The fate of a proposed ordinance that would designate Salem as a Sanctuary City has been delayed, as city officials have moved to defer action on the proposed ordinance until the beginning of next year. In a joint statement released Sunday evening, officials indicated that they have decided to defer action on the proposed Salem Sanctuary for Peace ordinance until early 2017. Officials indicated that a draft of an ordinance by Jan. 26, 2017. Ward 4 Councillor David Eppley, who proposed the ordinance, has stated the intent of the ordinance is to ensure that city employees do not participate in federal immigration enforcement activities. As a policy, the city generally works cooperatively with federal and state officials, and we will continue to do so, but we do not enforce federal immigration laws and do not expect to in the future, wrote Mayor Kimberly Driscoll in a statement on Facebook. Many communities follow similar protocols across the country, whether they call themselves a sanctuary city or not, as local police departments have long recognized that mutual trust is an important part of community policing and key to maintaining safe and strong neighborhoods. Eppley added on his Facebook account that he has deferred action on the Salem Sanctuary for Peace draft ordinance after a very positive meeting with Driscoll, Salem police chief Mary Butler, Latino and faith community leaders and Salems No Place for Hate committee. The term sanctuary city has become a hot button issue in the recent presidential election, with President-elect Donald Trump threatening to cut federal funding to sanctuary cities. As a community, it is my hope that we will continue to reiterate and reaffirm our beliefs in respect for equal rights and opportunities for all who call Salem home - none of which has changed since the election, wrote Driscoll in her statement. City officials will now meet during the coming weeks to come up with a final ordinance by Jan. 26. The Salem News reports that a Dec. 8 hearing on the ordinance has been cancelled. Salem strives to be a welcoming and inclusive city that is committed to protecting ans serving all who call it home, read the joint statement.Our strength is rooted in our rich diversity and proud immigrant history. We are confident that by working together we can re-affirm these values and work collaboratively to achieve the highest standards of equity and dignity for all of our residents.

City officials joined members of the newspaper and the Salem community in resurrecting a new news box to stand where the old one originally stood. The response comes after a group of vandals set fire to unknown explosives placed inside the box, causing an explosion which could be heard as far as one mile away, according to police. We are showing a sign of strength, says Gricel Ocasio, a publisher at the Rainbow Times who spoke to Patch after the incident occurred.

Salem Police are investigating the incident as a hate crime, Ocasio says. Authorities are offering a $5,000 reward for any information that helps investigators solve the case. I was enraged, Ocasio told Patch.I thought of who would do this and why? Why is it that we are being targeted for being who we are and for representing a marginalized community?

Regardless of the recurring incidents, Lashomb was shocked at the nature of the explosion. When I looked at the video, I was not expecting an explosion of that magnitude, Lashomb said.I gasped, cupped my mouth with my hand and was truly in shock. Support and coverage of the explosion has poured in from across the country since news broke about it Wednesday afternoon. National outlets such as LGBTQNation, the Advocate and others have covered the issue. The Rainbow Times was also pleased with how city officials reacted to the situation and are hopeful that those responsible are brought to justice. I also think its only a matter of time before they are caught, said Lashomb.So many people not only in law enforcement but in the entire community are outraged that they [those responsible] have put a tarnish on our city we love so much. Salem has become an LGBT mecca, and people are not happy [about the explosion].",1,4,1

1125,"A shoplifting arrest in Somerville Sunday evening turned nasty when the suspect allegedly made repeated threats on the life of a police officer and members of his family. Brian Kobs, 32, of Medford, allegedly told the officer he had 10 years hanging over his head and had nothing to lose by killing a police officer. Kobs also allegedly shouted racial slurs at the officer, according to the police report. At one point, the officer took out his cell phone and began filming Kobs during his rant at Somerville Hospital. The incident began around 6:15 p.m. Sunday night, when police were called to the Stop & Shop on McGrath Highway for a reported shoplifter. The caller, an employee at the store, began chasing the suspect through the parking lot toward Broadway. The suspect was described as a white male, wearing a gray shirt and black shorts. Witnesses told police the man had removed the gray shirt and was now carrying it as he traveled down Arlington Street. Police located the man, who later identified himself as Brian Kobs, on Arlington Street. Kobs was ordered to stop and allegedly ran across Arlington Street in an attempt to flee. When police caught up to him, he allegedly turned around quickly with his right hand clenched, prompting the officer to strike him with a closed fist, according to the report. Kobs allegedly continued to resist and attempted to strike police with his elbow as he was handcuffed. Police pepper sprayed him in an attempt to get him under control. Kobs was arrested for larceny last November and was known to Stop & Shop employees.

1126,"A shoplifting arrest in Somerville Sunday evening turned nasty when the suspect allegedly made repeated threats on the life of a police officer and members of his family. Brian Kobs, 32, of Medford, allegedly told the officer he had 10 years hanging over his head and had nothing to lose by killing a police officer. Kobs also allegedly shouted racial slurs at the officer, according to the police report. At one point, the officer took out his cell phone and began filming Kobs during his rant at Somerville Hospital. The incident began around 6:15 p.m. Sunday night, when police were called to the Stop & Shop on McGrath Highway for a reported shoplifter. The caller, an employee at the store, began chasing the suspect through the parking lot toward Broadway. The suspect was described as a white male, wearing a gray shirt and black shorts. Witnesses told police the man had removed the gray shirt and was now carrying it as he traveled down Arlington Street. Police located the man, who later identified himself as Brian Kobs, on Arlington Street. Kobs was ordered to stop and allegedly ran across Arlington Street in an attempt to flee. When police caught up to him, he allegedly turned around quickly with his right hand clenched, prompting the officer to strike him with a closed fist, according to the report. Kobs allegedly continued to resist and attempted to strike police with his elbow as he was handcuffed. Police pepper sprayed him in an attempt to get him under control. Kobs was arrested for larceny last November and was known to Stop & Shop employees. The man who reported the shoplifting to police told them he recognized Kobs from the November incident and followed him on surveillance cameras as he allegedly concealed numerous health and beauty products in a bag before quickly leaving the store.

1127,"A former volunteer with the Somerville Auxiliary Police Department was indicted this month on five counts of statutory rape following an alleged sexual relationship with a teenage boy, according to a Patriot Ledger report. James J. Killion, 22, is accused of entering into an 18-month relationship with the boy, who was 14 when the two met in 2014, the Patriot Ledger reported. Killion, an aspiring police officer who applied for a job with the Hanover Police Department, was arrested by Weymouth police in June after the boy told his father he had sex with an older man who was threatening to expose him online if he ended the relationship, according to a police report cited by the Ledger. The Ledger reported that the boy told police he met Killion on an online forum for gay and bisexual teenagers in the Boston area and also communicated on the smartphone apps Kik and Snapchat. According to the report, Killion is free on $5,000 bail and has been ordered to wear a GPS tracking device, as well as have no unsupervised contact with individuals under 18. >>>Read the full story from the Patriot Ledger here.

1128,"Somerville police are reminding residents to play Pokemon Go safely and responsibly. The increasingly popular smartphone app allows users to collect Pokémon characters in a simulated virtual world -- tapping into the devices GPS system to tracks where players are throughout the day, a release said. While no accidents or issues have been reported in Somerville due to Pokémon Go, numerous communities throughout the state and nation have documented incidents. Chief David Fallon asks that citizens remember to always be aware of their surroundings and to be respectful of others while playing. • Stay alert. Keep your eyes on the road and off your mobile screen when walking around, especially in areas where you need to cross the street or where there is heavy traffic flow. • Do not use the game while operating a motor vehicle. Keep the app closed while behind the wheel. Pull over and park your vehicle once youve reached your destination and plan your route ahead of time if the game requires you to walk to another location. • Let others know where youre going. If youre walking to an unfamiliar area, tell a friend or family member your plans. • Be visible. Stay in areas where you can be seen and where others can see you. Always be aware of your surroundings. • Be respectful. Do not loiter in front of homes or businesses. If in a large group, be aware of the time of day or night and keep noise at an appropriate volume. • Stay off private property and away from construction zones, as well as other areas where public access is prohibited. • Parents, set guidelines for children. Limit where they can go in your neighborhood and remind them to never interact or go anywhere with strangers.We recognize that, for many, Pokémon Go is a fun, interactive game that encourages users to go outside and walk around, Chief Fallon said. While doing so, we remind community members to always focus on whats in front of them, and to never go anywhere the public isnt normally allowed. We would hate to see someone get injured because of this game.",0,8,5
1129,"Somerville officers seized 27 pounds of marijuana and $70,000 in cash in a June 8 drug bust that began with complaints from the dealers neighbors, police said. Police made three arrests in connection with an investigation into drug dealing at 58 Bow St. that began in the past year, police said. Police were conducting routine surveillance on Bow Street when they allegedly saw Rory Watson, 36, of 64 Cedar St, Quincy, drive to the address. Police said an officer called headquarters and learned of Watsons previous arrests for drug dealing. Police said Watson carried two duffel bags into 58 Bow St. and minutes later exited with an extremely large black hockey-style bag…[that] appeared to be heavy as Mr. Watson appeared to struggle carrying it to his vehicle, according to a police report. Watson walked directly past an officer who detected an overwhelming smell of marijuana, police said. Officers followed Watson to Somerville Avenue where he exited his car to take his dog for a walk, police said. When officers stopped him, he became extremely nervous and offered untruthful answers to their questions, police said. A search of Watsons car revealed several pounds of marijuana, police said. How much trouble am I in, Watson allegedly asked. His car was towed. Officers then went back to 58 Bow Street to secure the area in anticipation of a search warrant. Officers entered the residence at 58A Bow St. and sat the two co-owners of the condominium down in their living room. After being read their Miranda rights, police said David Barlam, 30, led officers to marijuana in the cabinet. When Barlam tried to erase information from his phone, he was placed into custody, police said. As the condos other owner, Karolina Zeldon, 26, of 58 Bow St., was being taken into custody she allegedly yelled at Barlam, I hate you David, I knew you were going to get me in trouble with this shit. A search of the condo and the impounded car turned up 27 pounds of marijuana and $70,000 in cash. Officers found $40,000 in cash on the ground directly underneath the units kitchen window. Officers also found psilocybin mushrooms at 58 Bow St., police said. Watson was arrested and charged with conspiracy to violate a drug law, possession to distribute a class D drug and possession of a class C drug. Zeledon was arrested and charged with conspiracy to violate a drug law, distribution of a class D drug and possession with intent to distribute a class C drug.

1130,"Photo: Nicholas Rovinski Nicholas Rovinski, the 24-year-old Warwick man that has been under constant surveillance for days since it was learned he was connected to now-dead suspected terrorist Usaama Rahim, is in federal custody. Rovinski was led away from his Aspinet Drive house Thursday afternoon by authorities. A spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation confirmed that Rovinski was taken into custody and will be facing unspecified charges. The U.S. Attorneys Office in Boston is handling the case. Authorities descended on the Governor Francis Farms neighborhood where Rovinski lives with family members last week after their investigation into Rahims activities led them to Rovinski. Rahim, who was killed by Boston police on June 2, Rovinski and a third man, David Wright, reportedly met on a local beach and had a conversation in inclement weather to discuss their plans, which apparently included a plan to behead blogger Pamela Geller. Police searched the home and removed boxes of evidence in the days leading up to Rovinskis arrest on Thursday. The police presence has been unnerving for residents of the working class neighborhood here in Rhode Islands second-largest city. They said Rovinski always seemed like a nice young man but his appearance had changed dramatically after he converted to Islam about two years ago. For more than a week, residents have had to show ID to get in and out and police have kept steady watch on Rovinski. Rahim reportedly had planned to behead police officers in the Boston area. In a court complaint filed against Wright, Rahim had bought knives on Amazon to carry out the beheadings. The FBI has said that the attack appeared to be imminent. Authorities have not released many details about their ongoing investigation into Rovinski, though more information may be revealed once charges are filed in court Friday or early next week. Wright, of Everett, Mass., was arrested last week for for his role in the alleged conspiracy. It is clear, based on publicly accessible information on social media sites, Rovinski had an interest in specific things that could be considered a cause for concern to investigators. On YouTube, his account was subscribed to numerous survivalist channels and showed activity that included watching politically-charged videos and guides on how to build sniper rifles or fashion a machete with no power tools. One of the channels he subscribed to one month ago belongs to Sheikh Omar Bakri Muhammad, who is considered a radicalized hate cleric He also commented on numerous now-removed YouTube posts from so-called radical extremist clerics. CNN reported that Rovinski, in March, shared his extremist views with the network. In messages exchanged with a producer, he reportedly said he had talked with an ISIS operative who told him he should go to Iraq or Syria and join their cause. He was also vocal on Twitter. Who wishes to see flag of tawheed upon white house, he said in March. He also tweeted messages at people connected to ISIS, including Mujahid Miski, also known as Mohamed Abdullahi Hasan, who CNN reported is from Minnesota but might be fighting with Al Shabaab in Somalia. Rovinski reportedly went to a mosque near his house in Warwick.See also: Alleged Co-Conspirator With Roslindale Terror Suspect Arrested Family Views Video of Fatal Shooting of Usaamah Rahim Target of Roslindale Mans Alleged Terrorist Plot Revealed Everett Man Conspired to Support Attacking Boys In Blue, According to FBI Man Killed in Roslindale Confrontation Target of Terrorism Probe, Police Say",0,8,5
1131,"Above: Steve Leader (left), and Scott Leader on the night of their arrest. Two Boston men who allegedly beat and urinated on a homeless man in an attack one said was inspired by Donald Trumps rhetoric have been indicted on federal hate crime charges. Scott Leader, 38, and Steve Leader, 30, both of South Boston, were indicted for civil rights violations while causing bodily injury, a charge that carries up to 10 years in state prison. The indictments also charge both men with assault and battery for purposes of intimidation causing bodily injury, two counts each of assault and battery, and two counts each of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, District Attorney Daniel F. Conley announced Friday. The brothers have been in jail since the Aug. 19 attack on a homeless man resting in the JFK/UMass MBTA station, at about 12:30 a.m. Witnesses reported watching two men hit the 58-year-old homeless man repeatedly with a metal pole before walking away laughing. The pair also allegedly kicked, punched, and urinated on the victim. The witnesses followed the suspects after the attack, helping police find them. The victim was rushed to Boston Medical Center, where he was treated for a broken nose, serious bruising across his torso, and other injuries. At the State Police barracks in South Boston the night of the attack, Scott Leader reportedly incriminated himself and his brother in the crimes, saying he and his brother tuned up an illegal immigrant, and that this behavior was acceptable because the victim was homeless and Hispanic. He reportedly credited his thinking to Republican Presidential Candidate Donald Trumps anti-immigrant rhetoric.",1,8,0
1132,"After photos depicting a Boston police officer with his hand on the neck of a bandana wearing protester made the rounds on the internet yesterday, the protester in the photo is contemplating legal action against the Boston police, according to a report in the Boston Globe. The protester, who gave the Globe the name Allie but did not wish to be identified by gender, said the officer in question was not choking, but pushing him. He pushed me, Allie told the Globe in a telephone interview Monday. I turned to him and said dont push me. … Then he got angry. He grabbed me by the neck and then pushed me by the neck. He didnt choke me. Boston police said they are investigating the photo, which was taken by 22-year-old Paul Weiskel, a junior at UMass Boston, who uploaded it and other pictures of the event onto photo-sharing website Flickr. We need to review the totality of the circumstances and get a sense of what occurred before and after the incident, Boston police spokeswoman Elaine Driscoll said in a statement Monday. Allie told the Globe the officers actions did not seem warranted, and Allie is considering legal action, but did not elaborate, said the Globe report. Police made three arrests during Sundays Tea Party rally at the Boston Common, after a group of counter-protesters, many allegedly affiliated with Occupy Boston, rushed the stage where Tea Party activists—who had secured a legal permit for the event—were speaking. According to the Globe, Allie indicated that Allie attended the rally to represent gays, lesbians and transgender people. A description of the events leading up to the photograph, attributed to Allie, was posted on Facebook following the incident and reprinted by Weiskel on his Flickr page. Im holding was a wig I was wearing that a Tea Partier had just knocked off my head. I was asking the tea partier to explain to my why he thought it was okay to knock my wig off (My hand slipped, he replied sarcastically) when the officer came up and said something along the lines of okay, take your shit and get out of here and shoved me a few feet. I turned to him and said Dont push me. he replied Dont push you?! then did this. You can decide yourself if this was deserved or not. Weiskel, who did not see the events leading up to the confrontation, that the officers actions did appear a bit heavy-handed. I turned around and saw the cop had the guy by the neck, said Weiskel during a telephone interview, I dont know exactly what happened [to provoke the incident]... The cop had the kid by the neck, and then he pushes him and pushes another photographer ... First Amendment Under Fire? But thats only half the story. According to Weiskel, when the cop—identified by the Globe as decorated officer Vaden Scantlebury, a member of the force since 1983—noticed him taking photos, his attentions immediately turned to Weiskel. According to Weiskel, the officer approached him and took two swipes at my camera, knocking it out of my hands. The UMass Boston student said it appeared police were only concerned with his camera, and he did nothing to provoke them other than taking pictures. He had no grounds for coming at me, Weiskel said. I was nowhere near the incident. He didnt go after me, he went after my camera. According to the Globe, neither Scantlebury nor Patrolmans Association president Thomas Nee could be reached for comment yesterday. However law enforcement officials, speaking to the Globe on condition of anonymity, characterized Scantlebury as an experienced officer with a reputation for staying calm. Hes pretty laid back, one of the officials told the Globe. Scantlebury was one of three officers who helped rescue a Dorchester woman from a burning building in 1993. Five years later, Scantlebury was involved in the fatal sooting of a drug dealer. His partner fired the fatal shots as the dealer drove towards the officers, and was later honored with an award for bravery. Weiskel said he believes Scantlebury was trying to take his camera. He told the Globe he has been in contact with the ACLU regarding possible legal options. The officer repeatedly told him to step back and twice took the camera from his hand, said Weiskel. Glik v. Cuniffe Less than eight months ago in Federal Court, the Boston police lost its appeal of the decision that they violated the First and Fourth Amendment rights of Simon Glik—also on the Common—by denying him the right to openly videorecord and audiorecord police officers in public, by placing him under arrest. The decision stated that citizen journalists—such as Weiskel—and professional journalists have the right to record police in public places such as the Boston Common. In short, the right to film, photograph and record police in public is a First Amendment issue. Boston police spokeswoman Elaine Driscoll, however, said officials have stressed training officers on the nuances of the states wiretapping statute, which allows the public to photograph police officers as they work. There is a difference between the wire tapping statute and assault, Driscoll said to the Globe. Theyre getting assaulted by individuals that are holding cellphone cameras half an inch from their face and being told you cant do anything, you cant do anything. It remains unclear what that statement has to do with what happened on Sunday, as Weiskel was shooting with a digital camera equipped with a zoom lens, and says he was nowhere near the incident when approached by police. Certainly photography is not tantamount to felony assault. The problem with Driscolls statement is that it is not the states wiretapping statute that guarantees the right of Weiskel to photograph police, but rather the First Amendment of the US Constitution, as upheld by a Federal circuit court judge in Glik v. Cuniffe, et al. The American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts explains more about the wiretapping statute decision and your First Amendment Rights in this video.",0,8,5

1136,"The public safety departments are about to get the boost they requested from the town. Thursday night, town meeting members approved the fiscal year 2018 town budget 90-19-1. The total comes in at $95.1 million. The fire department, which has lobbied for an increase in staff, will receive funding for four more firefighters. The police department will also receive funds for four new members, two more than what was recommended by the finance committee. The motion to increase the number of officers came from Selectman Peter Brown, who said there are currently 39 patrolmen on duty in Stoughton. There are five officers that will join the department following their graduation from the Boston Police Academy in June and two more in September. In addition to two more endorsed by the finance committee, Brown moved to add $26,000 to the budget for two more officers who would start work in March. The extra funds would cover the two salaries through the remainder of the fiscal year. When all the officers start working, it will bring the departments stable of patrolman to 50. I think its time we start funding the police department to adequate numbers. We havent gained any number over the last few years. All weve done is replace people whove left, Brown said. Edward Trunfio, the chairman of the finance committee, said the cost of the two officers would cost $130-140,000 once they are included in the budget for a full year. We cant keep throwing the bodies, the budget cant support it. You hate to hire someone this year and fire them the next year, Trunfio said.

1137,"A Stoughton man who allegedly stole a vehicle from a dealer took police on a chase through town, claims he helped the Patriots win the Super Bowl, and called President Trump a racial epithet often connected with African Americans, police said. Anthony Craan, 34, was arrested Feb. 17 after a chase which reached speeds of up to 100 miles per hour, police said. It started at about 7 p.m. when Officer Robert Kuhn responded to a report of a car stolen from a dealer in Avon, according to a police report obtained in Stoughton District Court. Kuhn went by Craans home several times but did not see the missing Audi in the driveway. While on Tenth Street, Kuhn saw an Audi with dealers plates and an Avon Auto Broker plate on the front of the vehicle. After pulling the vehicle over on Turnpike Street to conduct a traffic stop, Kuhn learned that Craan had four outstanding warrants and told the suspect that he was being placed under arrest. Craan allegedly responded by rolling up his window and driving away. Officers followed Crann through town as he allegedly reached speeds of 100 mph on roads with a speed limit of 30 mph. The chase came to an end as Craan attempted to drive to the Avon town line but got stuck in traffic. He allegedly tried to flee police on foot but three officers apprehended him and prevented him from running. A passenger in the car was placed in police custody for her safety but was not arrested, according to court records. During the booking process, Crann allegedly said he was the reason the New England Patriots won the Super Bowl because he is a voodoo god and that President Donald Trump is his [racial epithet]. He also made jokes about the incident, calling it fun and exciting, according to the police report. Crann was charged with receiving stolen property over $250, operating with a suspended license (subsequent offense), reckless operation of a motor vehicle, failure to stop for police, two counts of failure to stop/yield, resisting arrest, disorderly conduct, speeding, marked lanes violation, and failure to appear in court upon recognizance according to court documents in Stoughton District Court.

1140,"SUDBURY, MA—Sudbury police say they are grateful that residents called to tell them about two solicitors who roamed the neighborhoods on Monday, June 12. Both were in violation of the Sudbury Door-to-Door Salesman Bylaw. As a result, both subjects were cited and their supervisor was contacted regarding their infractions reminding him of the requirements in Sudbury, said Police Chief Scott Nix. We hope the enforcement taken yesterday will help mitigate future violations but we remind residents to call us if they suspect solicitors are in violation of the bylaw, said Nix. This bylaw can be found here in the Town of Sudbury General Bylawsunder Section 29: Door-To-Door Salesman or the subjects are acting inappropriately. We do not have jurisdiction over nonprofit or religious organization, said Nix, but those for-profit organizations that wish to solicit door-to-door must be licensed by the state or have a solicitor license issued by the Sudbury Police Department that should be displayed. As well, they must abide by the stipulations contained in the bylaw. Nix said that those who purport to be a nonprofit or religious organization in nature but then try to sell something are in violation. Residents, too, have a right to ask any solicitor to leave their property, and if they are aggressive or try to get into the residence, the police should be called. Additionally, residents can opt to be added to a non-solicitation list for-profit solicitors must abide by. This can be accomplished by sending an email to police@sudbury.ma.us or dropping off the request at our station with the form found on our webpage.

1142,"Sudbury Police Chief Scott Nix cites a murder at Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School as his most memorable, and upsetting, incidents hes dealt with in his career. A Sudbury lieutenant at the time, on Jan. 19 of 2007 two students got into an altercation in a hallway at Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School. It resulted in the death of one of those students. Nix says the shooting at Sandy Hook in December, 2012, in which 20 children were shot at a school in Connecticut, is a national case hell never forget. We have a family who lost their daughter who live in Sudbury, said Nix. One of my passions is school safety. It reinforced with me that we need to be vigilant and do the best we can for our youth and staff in terms of safety, school protocols and police protocols. Michelle and Bob Gay were in the process of relocating from Connecticut to Sudbury when their daughter Josephine was among those killed in the Sandy Hook shootings. Michelle, along with Alissa Parker, co-founded Safe and Sound in honor of their daughters.

1146,"Photo Credit: Academy of Notre Dame website TYNGSBOROUGH, MA—A student at the Academy of Notre Dame has been charged in connection with what police say was an elaborate hoax, including a note left in a bathroom that prompted the school to close for a day. Tyngsborough Police Chief Richard D. Howe announced Thursday that a 15-year-old Lowell girl will be charged with Disturbing a School Assembly and Criminal Harassment, with other charges potentially forthcoming. Police allege the student created an elaborate hoax including racial remarks and racist threats over social media, culminating with a note containing an unspecified threat which would happen at the school the following day, forcing the school closure. The student was expelled as a result of the investigation, Tyngsborough Police say. I would like to thank Notre Dame President Maureen Appel and High School principal Helen Kay for their invaluable assistance in this investigation, Chief Howe said. I also commend the work of Sgt. Steve Manning and Detective Sergeant Cynthia Shay who brought a resolution to this complicated case. According to Tyngsborough Police, reports of racist messages sent over Facebook, Instagram, and the online educational tool Quizlet targeting minority students at the parochial school in town surfaced over the past several months, beginning in February. Some of the remarks included the initials of another female student. On May 16, a threatening letter was found in a Notre Dame bathroom, alluding to an unspecified threat that would take place at school on the following day. Administrators then cancelled school for the day as a result of the letter. An investigation into the social media posts allowed detectives to trace the content to an IP address to the suspects home. The suspect later confessed to the material and to putting another students initials on the material, including the threatening note, in attempt to frame her, police say.",1,0,3

In partnership with host UMass Lowell, MPY is hosting the annual SECURE XX conference that will feature Chief Smith as an introductory speaker. He will discuss the growing incidents of hate crimes and bigotry that have plagued communities nationwide, creating a culture of fear and vulnerability in many schools. He will also address the essential role that educators and community leaders play in creating an inclusive atmosphere in order to proactively combat hate and extremism. Educators and law enforcement professionals have a critical responsibility to make schools as inclusive and welcoming as they can be, Chief Smith said. Our schools and communities need to take the lead in the nationwide fight against hate and violence, and Im eager to participate in the exchange of ideas and approaches that will help us solve this problem. Additional presentations will include information on cyber threats and vulnerabilities, extremism, online safety and education about sensitive issues such as hate.

1149,"Middlesex District Attorney Marian Ryan and Middlesex Partnerships for Youth hosted more than 350 students from middle and high schools across Middlesex County, including Wakefield, at this years Empowering Girls 2015 conferences held at The Broad Institute in Cambridge. This years conference focused on the theme Curate Your Life: Creating Your Own Story, encouraging girls to use curation to help identify their strengths and assets to determine their own trajectory to success -- now and in the future. The program is designed to encourage confidence-building, self-assertion and goal-setting through compelling speakers and interactive presentations. Participants were encouraged to reflect on their lives and to analyze what they are doing well and where they could improve. They also heard from speakers that highlighted their own personal success and failure and encouraged students to build strong relationships, always be eager to learn and not fear their faults. During an interactive breakout session at the Conference the students created a story board using what they had learned about curation from the speakers. The young women also wrote a letter to themselves and preserved it in a time capsule to be opened at a later date. The objective of Empowering Girls is to encourage young women to think positively about themselves, to embrace what makes them unique and to use those traits to achieve their goals, said District Attorney Ryan. This years theme was really special because the participants got to listen to the personal stories of some very positive female role models and then reflect on that and learn how to tell the story of their own life. Students who attended the events represented schools from across Middlesex County, including, Arlington, Arlington School in Belmont, Assabet Valley, Bedford, Everett, Greater Lowell Technical High School, Hudson, Jackson School of Newton, Malden,Nashoba Valley Technical High School, Natick, Somerville, St. Raphael School of Medford, Valley Collaborative, Wakefield, Watertown, Winchester and Woburn.

District Attorney Ryan chairs the MPY Board of Directors. Through MPYs efforts, educators, parents, and students engage in collaborative trainings with law enforcement, social services, and community-based organizations as well as share the latest information and resources.

Father Martin Walsh was posted at Our Lady Comforter of the Afflicted when he abused a 13-year-old boy in 1975, Mitchell Garabedian, an attorney for the alleged victims, said. According to Garabedian the abuse occurred in a cabin in Sunapee, NH. The accuser is now in his 50s. Walsh, who died in 2007, is one of three priests included in the settlement listed as unsubstantiated cases on an archdiocesan website that tracks accusations against clergy, according to the Boston Globe. But Garabedian says the churchs settlement, which he describes as well into the five figures, substantiates his clients claims. My clients case was settled monetarily, Garabedian said. As a result of the settlement one can state that my client was found to be credible. In addition to the seven in Boston, two other cases involving priests from other religious orders who worked in Boston were also settled. Garabedian reached seven additional settlements with religious orders across the country, including one that involved a brother who was assigned to the Northshore Mall in Peabody after being accused of abuse in Los Angeles. He says he has more than a hundred cases still pending. Unfortunately the amount of clergy sexual abuse is endless, Garabedian said.

1153,"Wayland Patch asked Police Chief Robert Irving some questions we think our readers would like to ask him themselves. Here, he shares his thoughts on crime statistics, race relations, unsolved mysteries, where speeders get caught the most and more. Wayland Patch: What is the biggest, or most pressing, crime or issue that concerns the police department in Wayland? Chief Irving: The number one issue for the police department always revolves around complaints of speeding motor vehicles and cut-through traffic. The department spends a great deal of time on enforcing motor vehicle laws and works with the Department of Public Works to make sure the roads are as safe as possible for all motorists and pedestrians. WP: Your most memorable case in your career, and also as Wayland chief: CI: The most memorable case in my career occurred here while I was chief. I will never forget the loss of Wayland resident Lauren Dunne Astley, who was murdered, at the age of 18, on July 3, 2011. The officers did a great job working on a missing persons case, which, sadly, turned out to be a homicide. The community came together to help support Laurens family and friends and make sure that she is long remembered in Wayland. WP: The subject of race relations, racial profiling and police brutality is obviously an extremely hot button topic these days. Have you had to address this issue with any of your officers/department? Are there changing concerns in this area? CI: All Wayland officers understand that there is zero tolerance for policing based on racial or any other bias. The same is true for police brutality or excessive force. The Wayland Police Department is one of the few departments in the Boston area that uses dash cameras with audio in every marked police cruiser. This adds a level of accountability to the public, at the same time it protects our officers from frivolous or false claims of misconduct. WP: Are there any unsolved mysteries in Wayland? CI: Waylands biggest unsolved case is the disappearance and murder of nine year old Sarah Pryor. Sarah went missing on Oct. 9, 1985, when she went for a walk on Concord Road. More than 10 years later, a bone fragment was found in a construction area. The fragment was analyzed using DNA testing and was identified as being Sarah. Despite periodic leads, and a suspect who is imprisoned in Texas for committing a similar crime, no charges have ever been filed in the case. WP: What was a national case that was most compelling to you? CI: The murder of Jennifer Hawke-Pettit, Michaela Petit and Hayley Petit in Cheshire , Connecticut on July 23, 2007, during a home invasion impacted me greatly. I served on the Cheshire Police Department for 22 years and grew up in Cheshire. Most of the responding officers and investigators were men and women who I knew and had worked with for many years. The Petit family lived less than a mile from where our family lived. Jennifer Hawke-Petit was the nurse at the private school that my daughter had attended. Joshua Komisarjevsky, one of the two men convicted of the crime, had attended birthday parties for my son when he was a child. The crime gained national notoriety and was made into an HBO documentary. The two men that committed the crime, Joshua Komisarjevsky and Stephen Hayes, were sentenced to death and are incarcerated on death row in Somers, Connecticut.. The horror of what happened in that suburban home on that summer night in 2007 affects the community of Cheshire to this day. WP: Where do drivers get nabbed the most for speeding in Wayland? CI: Although we do directed speed enforcement on most major roads in Wayland, I would still say most speeding citations are issued to vehicles driving on Route 20.",0,8,5

WP: The subject of race relations, racial profiling and police brutality is obviously an extremely hot button topic these days. Have you had to address this issue with any of your officers/department? Are there changing concerns in this area?

WP: Are there any unsolved mysteries in Westborough? CG: Our rate of success in solving crimes is very high. I cannot think of any case that has any major impact on the town that has not been solved. WP: What was a national case that was most compelling to you? CG: Most definitely 9-11. just the mere fact that our country had been impacted by those terrorists had a major impact on how we conducted ourselves as police officers. WP: Where do drivers get nabbed the most for speeding in Westborough? CG: The major commuting routes receive a great deal of attention.

They were evacuated for a while, Scoble said. They are now back in. The levels are way below the threshold (of dangerous). It is being monitored constantly.

Police however, are not labeling it a hate crime, but rather an attempted burglary. The investigation is ongoing. Photo Credit: Worcester Police",0,8,5
1188,"BOSTON – A Worcester man is facing charges after he allegedly attacked a worker at JFK Airport on Wednesday night, yelling expletives at her and mocking her while invoking President Trumps name, the Queens County District Attorney said. Robin Rhodes, 57, had arrived from Aruba for a connecting flight when he spotted a woman, Delta employee Rabeeya Khan, with a head scarf working in the Delta Sky Lounge. He allegedly told the Khan Trump will get rid of you, according to the DAs press release. Rhodes then allegedly taunted Khan and asked, Are you [expletive] sleeping? Are you praying? What are you doing? before he punched the door, kicked her in the leg and wouldnt let her leave. When Khan ask Rhodes what she had done, he allegedly replied, You did nothing but Im going to kick your [expletive] ass. When another person came in to try and calm Rhodes down, Khan ran out of the office, but Rhode followed her, the release says. He then allegedly imitated Muslim praying and shouted [Expletive] Islam, [expletive] ISIS, Trump is here now. He will get rid of you all. You can ask Germany, Belgium, and France about these kind of people. You will see what happens. Rhodes was arraigned Thursday in New York on charges of a third-degree assault as a hate crime, second-degree unlawful imprisonment as a hate crime, third-degree menacing as a hate crime, first-degree harassment as a hate crime, third-degree assault, second-degree unlawful imprisonment, second-degree aggravated harassment, menacing and first-degree harassment. He faces up to four years in prison if convicted. The bigotry and hatred that the defendant is accused of manifesting and acting upon have no place in a civilized society – especially in Queens County, the most culturally diverse county in the nation, Queens DA Richard Brown said. Crimes of hate will never be tolerated here and when they do, regrettably occur, those responsible will be brought to justice. And for those wondering, yes, the DAs release did say the Rhodes was from Worchester. Photo via Wikimedia Commons",1,0,0
1189,"A 22-year-old male from Norwood accused of dragging a woman under his car down Route 1 is free on bail after an arraignment hearing at Wrentham District Court. Moses Acloque is accused of dragging the body of an Arbor Inn employee Kanchan Patel under his truck for three miles on Route 1 from the Arbor Inn in Wrentham to Chickie Flynns in Foxboro. He pleaded not guilty to charges of leaving the scene of a collision causing death; motor vehicle homicide by negligent operation, leaving the scene of a personal injury crash, two counts of leaving the scene of property damage, and driving while license to operate suspended. Acloque is free on $3,000 bail but will have to wear a GPS monitoring bracelet, stay away from the Ann Arbor Inn, and have no contact with any witnesses or employees of the motel. Originally, the Norfolk County District Attorneys office requested $5,000 bail, GPS monitoring, house arrest with exception for court dates, medical appointments, and religious commitments, no contact with with the motel or the witnesses, and no driving. Acloques attorney Rudy Miller requested $2,500 bail with GPS monitoring, and a curfew stating that Acloque needed to drive to go to his job. Miller said that he does not dispute that the vehicle did travel at a high speed down Route 1 or that there was a deceased person stuck on the vehicle. He did say however that Acloque was unaware of the body on his truck and that Acloque was  heart-struck over the incident. According to the timeline set by the district attorneys office in court, a state trooper saw a gray and a white Ford F-150 driving down Route 1 at high speed around 10 a.m. on Nov. 18. The gray truck, which was driving erratically to get the officers attention, told the officer after being pulled over near Bass Pro Shot that Acloques truck had just ran someone over. Meanwhile, Acloque had entered the parking lot of Chickie Flynns where he discovered the body attached to his car. The state trooper tried to block the exit with no lights on but Acloque managed to leave the parking lot. After turning on his lights, the trooper was able to pull over Acloque. Returning to Chickie Flynns, the officer discovered the dead body of Patel in the parking lot. Earlier in the night, Acloque was at motel to watch Monday Night Football at a party. Prosecutors say that he was at the inn without payment and permission but attorney Rudy Miller said that he was visiting and did not rent the room. Acloque left after demands of money from the inn staff and hit Patel and her husband in his truck when they attempted to stop him from leaving. While the husband was hit, Kanchan was pulled under the car. Testimony from residents at the inn does confirm a commotion late Monday night, Miller said his client drove away because he was attempting to escape an assault by three men including one motel employe. After the hearing, Miller told reporters that he did not know why his client was attacked. Miller claims that injuries from the alleged assault was the reason why Acloque was treated at Norwood Hospital later than evening. Acloque will be back in court on Dec. 19 for a probable cause hearing.",0,8,5

1193,"RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — A Marine Corps drill instructor was sentenced Friday to 10 years in prison for choking, punching or otherwise tormenting recruits, especially three Muslims — one of whom ultimately killed himself by leaping down a stairwell. A military jury handed out the punishment to Gunnery Sgt. Joseph Felix a day after convicting him of abusing more than a dozen trainees at the Marine boot camp at Parris Island, South Carolina. Among other things, he taunted the Muslims as terrorists or ISIS and ordered two of them to climb into an industrial clothes dryer, spinning one of them around in the scorching machine until he renounced his faith, the jury decided. Felix, a 34-year-old Iraq veteran, was also ordered to forfeit all pay, demoted to private and given a dishonorable discharge. Felix was a central figure in what was found to be a group of abusive drill instructors at Parris Island. After the March 2016 suicide at the base, a hazing investigation led to charges against Felix, five other drill instructors and the training battalions commanding officer. Eleven others faced lesser discipline. Abusive drill instructors have long been stock characters in books and movies like Full Metal Jacket. But that 1987 film was set during the Vietnam War, and the Felix trial shows that since then the Marines have drawn clearer lines between what instructors can and cannot do, said Michael Hanzel, a former Navy attorney who attended the proceedings at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. This generation now, theres things that I think that were much more focused on. In particular, in this trial, its calling people names based on their religion and targeting people based on their religion, said Hanzel, now a private attorney specializing in military law. I dont think anyone would say that was acceptable ever, but it probably was not prosecuted in the past the way it would be now. The charges against Felix included commanding recruits to choke each other; ordering them to drink chocolate milk and then training them until they vomited; and punching recruits in the face or kicking them to the ground. He wasnt making Marines. He was breaking Marines, prosecutor Lt. Col. John Norman told the jury on Wednesday. He called Felix a bully who heaped special abuse on three Muslim recruits because of their faith. One of them, Raheel Siddiqui, a 20-year-old Pakistani-American from Taylor, Michigan, hurled himself to his death after what the jury decided was mistreatment by Felix that included slapping Siddiqui and calling him a terrorist. Siddiquis family sued the Marine Corps last month for $100 million. The government did not charge Felix with any crime directly related to Siddiquis death. The judge, Lt. Col. Michael Libretto, did not allow testimony about whether Felixs actions were responsible for the recruits suicide. Felix also was convicted of ordering Lance Cpl. Ameer Bourmeche into a dryer, which then was turned on as Felix demanded, Are you still Muslim? Bourmeche testified that he twice affirmed his faith and Felix and another drill instructor twice sent him for a bruising, scorching tumble inside the machine. After a third spin, Bourmeche said, he feared for his life and renounced his religion. The drill instructors then let him out, he said. Felix was found guilty as well of ordering Bourmeche to simulate chopping off the head of a fellow Marine while reciting God is great in Arabic. The jury decided Felix also ordered Rekan Hawez, a native of Iraqi Kurdistan, to climb into the dryer. The machine was never turned on. Felix was convicted, too, of rousing nearly two dozen recruits from their sleep, ordering them to lie on the floor, and then walking on them along with two other drill instructors. In a closing statement Wednesday, defense attorney Navy Lt. Cmdr. Daniel Bridges, said the government unfairly fashioned contradictory witness accounts into a case against the brawny drill instructor who called all recruits terrorist. ___ By EMERY P.

1194,"Wayne County Sheriff Benny Napoleon deputized 10 Detroit police officers Wednesday, a move that extends their jurisdiction to the entire county as authorities strengthen patrols along the U.S.-Canada border. Napoleon and Detroit Police Chief James Craig said at a news conference that the sheriffs office and Detroit Police Department agreed last summer to pool some resources to better control criminal situations along the border, but working together on land and water and in the air better prepares law enforcement to respond to potential terrorism. Its no secret that this international border we sit on is ranked No. 1 in the country for commercial travel, Craig said. And when you look at the number of personal vehicles that travel across this international border, were ranked third. Clearly, thats a challenge. The threat of terrorism didnt just come about in recent months. This has been something weve been challenged with since 9/11, and here we had the ... terrorist attack on American soil just last week. So a constant state of readiness is the order of the day. Also on Patch Police say theyve also stepped up patrols around mosques and other houses of worship, scheduled meetings with local religious leaders and are increasing training of emergency personnel in response to heightened anti-Muslim rhetoric after terrorist attacks both California and abroad. Additional security has been hired by leaders of local mosques in response to what Imad Hamad, director of the American Human Rights Council, told The Detroit News is a real fear of violence in Dearborn, which has the largest Arab-American population in the area. Hamad said he doesnt want to cause panic, but said commonsense vigilance is in order. Dearborn Police Chief Ronald Haddad said that though authorities havent received a specific threat, patrols are providing more visibility around schools, businesses and places of worship. No one is oblivious to the emotional opinions that are circulating around the country, Haddad told The Detroit News. We just want to make sure we maintain a balance on public safety, so people can go on with their lives. Its not just Muslims who are nervous. Police are more visible in Oak Park, which has a large Jewish population. In Troy, pastors at a couple of large mega churches worry about extremists who may want to make a statement against Christianity, Troy Police Sgt. Meghan Lehman told The News.

1195,"A Catholic hospital in Detroit has severed its ties, at least temporarily, with a West Bloomfield doctor under federal investigation after authorities found 14 bottles containing what is believed to be human tissue in the trunk of his car. Authorities with the West Bloomfield Township Police Department, Michigan Attorney Generals Office and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration raided the West Bloomfield home and Farmington Hills office of Dr. Michael Roth on Tuesday. Roth, an OB-GYN specialist who had previously been cited for performing home abortions in 1998 and 1999, was placed on a leave of absence from St. John Providence Hospital, WXYZ-TV reports. In a statement, the hospital said: Michael Roth, MD is a private practice physician (not employed by the hospital) on leave of absence. Our by-laws clearly require all physicians to adhere to the ethical religious directives, meaning no abortions in the hospital. Roth has a dubious history that includes botched abortions and malpractice allegations, The Oakland Press reports. In 2004, the Michigan Department of Community Health fined him $15,000 for violating the state Public Health Code and ordered him never to perform a pregnancy termination procedure outside an approved clinic, hospital or office setting, a stipulation Roth reportedly agreed to honor. » Get Patchs daily newsletter and real-time news alerts. He was required to pay another fine, for $2,000, in 2012 for violation of duty and negligence. Violations against the physician date back to 1997 and include failure to keep accurate charts, not requiring blood work before procedures and issuing prescriptions without explaining the reason. He also allegedly performed two abortions in the home of a woman who had been described as agoraphobic. The raid on his home and office last week came after Roth allegedly struck a pedestrian on Oct. 1 on Orchard Lake Road. The man was walking across 14 Mile Road, just west of Orchard Lake. The vehicle was impounded, leading to the discovery of the fentanyl and possible human tissue and a subsequent investigation by the township police department, Michigan Attorney Generals Office and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. Besides the bottles containing the suspected human tissue found in baby food-sized bottles, authorities also seized several vials of large amounts of fentanyl, a powerful opioid used as a surgical anesthesia and for pain management. In an interview with The Oakland Press, West Bloomfield Township Police Chief Mike Patton said the tissue specimens were not human fetuses. He said the fentanyl may be more problematic for the physician. We believe some violations of the law have occurred but there is no rush to judgment, Patton said. Roth is licensed to practice from his office in Farmington HIlls and another office on Eight Mile Road in Eastpointe, the TV station said. He also had reportedly worked in Novi.

1197,"Local residents are voicing opposition to a controversial program that would see Bensalem Township police partner with ICE on local immigration enforcement. A protest estimated to include about 25 people was held outside the Bensalem Township Council meeting on Monday, and there is also an online petition circulating. The residents are opposing Bensalems involvement in the 287(g) program, which allows designated police officers to conduct federal immigration checks on residents who are suspected to be illegally living in the country. If approved, Bensalem would be the first Pennsylvania agency involved, according to the latest data provided by ICE. The program, touted by President Donald Trump, has received public support from Bensalems Director of Public Safety Fred Harran. The intention of this program is to be one more tool in the toolbox to prevent crime, to stop the criminal from committing a crime tomorrow, Harran said, according to a report by the Bucks County Courier Times. To be eligible for the program, officers must take a four-week basic training course administered by ICE. A one-week refresher training program must also be completed every two years, according to information from ICE. The program is active with 59 law enforcement agencies in 17 states. Mayor Joe DiGirolamo has pledged that officers would not barge into local businesses or restaurants to check workers statuses, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. But residents are still concerned. The online petition, entitled 287(g) is Bad For Bensalem, says the town should be focusing on policies that make us more, not less, welcoming to newcomers.

To the Detroit Nation family and to all who know her, Rachel embodied a passion for building communities and demonstrated that one person can always make an impact, the post read. We will miss her warmth, her vision and most of all her ability to connect and give purpose to those who shared in her goal of giving back to our hometown. We remain committed to honoring Rachels legacy and to building upon her incredible foundation. Longtime family friend David Techner told The Oakland Press the Jacobs death is a true loss for the world. A defining passion was the city of Detroits rebirth, he said, but she was active in all kinds of issues, continuing a legacy of public service established by her parents, John and Gilda Jacobs. Gilda Jacobs political career spanned 1981-2010, from a spot on the Huntington Woods City Commission to the state Senate. Thats exactly what she patterned her life after, Techner said of Jacobs commitment to public service. She and her sister (Jessica) are exactly what you would want – great people. ... It was in her DNA to be active and involved. High Bar for Achievement The comments on the CrowdRise page help tell the story of a kind, brilliant and compassionate woman who inspired others with her unflinching support for Detroit. In memory of Rachel, with the hope that word of her amazing efforts on behalf of Detroit will spark others to carry on her mission, Cheryl Scott Dube and Paul Dube wrote. In tribute to Rachel Jacobs, who personified tikkun olam, and in sorrow and with hugs to John and Gilda, who raised an extraordinary daughter, and in solidarity with our native city of Detroit, which has benefited so greatly from Rachels efforts and will continue to rise due in no small part to her devotio, wrote Howard and Carol Boigon. Rachel was an inspiration to me and my family for as long as I remember, wrote Katy Zack. We will miss the high bar she set for achievement in love, family, career and beyond. In honor and memory of the incredible Rachel Jacobs, a true Mensch and inspiration to the Swarthmore and Detroit ex-pat communities, wrote Trish (Mulvoy) Kipins. May her memory be a blessing. Others recalled Jacobs during her days in college at Swarthmore College and, later, Columbia Business School. Classmate Jill Rubin recalled the time we spent in college digging the compost pile and rummaging through trash for recyclables. I remember her smile, her kindness, optimism and brilliance.

1204,"The following was Lower Merion Police Superintendent Michael McGraths statement on the Investigation of the Penn Wynne Code Violation Incident (Jan, 27, 2015) at the Feb. 4, 2015, Police Committee meeting of the Township Board of Commissioners: On Tuesday evening, January 27th, a posting was made on the social media site, Lower Merion Community Network about two police incidents witnessed earlier that day. The posting makes several allegations regarding the investigating officers conduct and the practices and policies of the Lower Merion Police Department. Specifically, the poster questions if the two stops were the result of racial profiling; if it is appropriate to have the kids sit in the snow while interrogated for prolonged periods of time while the officer ran checks on them; and if anyone shoveling snow required a Township permit. The post also questions if the officers would have stopped white kids shoveling. The reference to kids in the posting apparently caused the majority of the people who responded to the post to assume the subjects stopped by the officers were school aged children under the age of eighteen. I immediately assigned the on-duty Commander, to review the days incident reports to determine the facts related to these incidents. We determined that two incidents related to Canvassing and Soliciting were located in the days incident records. It was not clear that these two incidents were the ones referred to in the post as the ages of the males, 40, 40, 34 in the first case; and 34 and 18 in the second case, along with a review of the mobile video recordings of the stops showed that the individuals stopped were clearly adults, not kids. We then contacted the investigating officer by phone as the officers shift had ended. The officer confirmed that he observed numerous individuals and groups shoveling snow during the day, however he did not stop any juveniles for canvassing and soliciting, or for shoveling snow. The officer said that he had observed two groups of adult males going door to door and he stopped them for canvassing and soliciting and had investigated and documented both incidents. He further confirmed that no one was issued citations for any code violations. Early Wednesday morning, January 28th, I assigned staff to conduct an investigation of the allegations contained in the social media posting. Throughout the day, Wednesday, numerous media outlets contacted the police department and Township requesting comments about the information provided in the posting. The information we had available at that time was provided to these various media outlets. As part of the investigation we made attempts throughout the day to contact the poster. We were unsuccessful as our calls went unreturned. We continued our attempts throughout Thursday, January 29th via phone and a visit to the residence. At 1:30 pm on Thursday, we reached the resident via phone. It was learned that the resident had driven past the first stop and watched the second stop from her residence, and believed all the males were in their early teens. During the course of our conversation, we informed her that the individuals she observed were in their 30s and 40s except for the one 18 year old, and that our department does not stop juveniles for shoveling snow, raking leaves or any other similar activity. She was also informed that the canvassing and soliciting code was established many years ago at the request of residents who felt uncomfortable and did not want strangers knocking at their doors and that the department had investigated 141 soliciting complaints in 2013. The resident expressed surprise about the information provided and felt that the Township should do more to notify residents about this ordinance. In response to her inquiries about the regulation, she was informed that the police department hosted a well attended, televised community meeting in November 2013 which covered this issue and that all Township codes are available on the Township website. Her response was, no one is saying you (LMPD) did anything wrong, but we should address the emotional undercurrent of race relations in the Township. We concluded the conversation by asking her to feel comfortable and not hesitate to contact the police department in the future if she had any concerns about the departments handling of any incident. Upon review of this incident, the police department has determined the following: In reference to the enforcement of the ordinance on Canvassing and Soliciting, although it is not specifically listed as an exemption, it has been the policy and practice of the township to not require juveniles to obtain permits for such activities as yard work or shoveling snow. We also conducted a review of our records to determine the number of complaints received related to canvassing and soliciting and determined the following:  The investigation is concluded and it has been determined that the investigating officer had reasonable suspicion to conduct an investigatory stop of these five adult males for violation of a Township Code. During the officers investigations, it was within policy and practice to restrict the mens movement after it was learned that one subject on both stops had possible outstanding arrest warrants. As soon as the warrants were resolved on both stops, the officer told the men that they could stand. The Mobile Video recording showed that the officers demeanor was relaxed, non-threatening and respectful. Additionally, he provided a full explanation of his actions to the men he had stopped. The demeanor and conduct of the subjects stopped was also casual and non-threatening as well, including smoking cigarettes and talking about sports with the assisting officers. The officer also provided an explanation of his actions to the male resident of the home on Overbrook Parkway at the conclusion of his investigation. Upon a thorough and comprehensive review of these incidents it is clear that the officer acted in a respectful, professional and appropriate manner during his interaction with these citizens. The tactics utilized and the professional manner in which the officer conducted the investigations conformed to all policies and training of this department.",0,8,5
1205,"By Kara Seymour Arrest warrants for three people have been issued after the Philadelphia District Attorney said Tuesday they were involved with an attack on a gay couple earlier this month. Philip Williams, 24; Kevin Harrigan, 26; and Katherine Knott, 24, are being charged in connection with an assault on a gay couple on the 1600 block of Chancellor Street in Philadelphia on Sept. 11, according to the District Attorney. Each will be charged with two counts of aggravated assault, two counts of simple assault, two counts of recklessly endangering another person and one count of criminal conspiracy. All three live in Bucks County. I would like to thank the police for their thorough investigation and the public for the outpouring of information and tips in this case, District Attorney Seth Williams said. This vicious attack shocked the entire country. An assault on people because of their sexual orientation has no place in Philadelphia. According to police, the two men bumped into a crowd of about a dozen young men and women on the 1600 block of Chancellor Street. Reports say that members of the group began to make disparaging remarks about their sexuality before attacking both men. The victims were sent to Hahnemann University Hospital with severe injuries.",1,4,0
1206,"A new smartphone application has been developed to help the Pennsylvania State Police receive reports regarding suspicious activity that may be linked to terrorism. The new See Something, Send Something app allows suspicious activity to be captured as a photo or written note and sent to the Pennsylvania Criminal Intelligence Center. This app provides concerned citizens with an effective communications and reporting tool, State Police Commissioner Frank Noonan said. The See Something, Send Something mobile app, developed by My Mobile Witness, sends terrorism-related tips directly to PaCIC where tips are evaluated by analysts and assigned for investigation as warranted, Noonan said. The application, which is available at no cost for iPhone and Android phone users, also includes information on what to look for and when to report suspicious activity, along with how to receive important alerts. No one knows what goes on in your neighborhood better than you, Noonan said. You may see or hear things that seem out of the ordinary and raise your suspicions—if you see something suspicious taking place, report it. One tip from an alert citizen can prove valuable and protect Pennsylvania from a potential terrorist act, Noonan said. My Mobile Witness uses patent-pending privacy protection software for safeguarding the integrity of tips and citizens personal information. The system allows the PaCIC to engage citizens without tracking location or storing of personal information. Submitted tips are immediately removed from the mobile device and purged from the My Mobile Witness system once delivered to the intelligence center for analysis. Factors such as race, ethnicity, national origin, or religious affiliation alone are not suspicious activity. For that reason, the public should report only suspicious behavior and situations (e.g., an unattended backpack or briefcase in a public place) rather than beliefs, thoughts, ideas, expressions, associations, or speech unrelated to terrorism or other criminal activity. Only reports that document behavior reasonably indicative of criminal activity related to terrorism will be shared with local, state and federal partners. Prevention is everyones responsibility, Noonan said. We are one neighborhood, one state, one nation; and it is the responsibility of all to remain vigilant and to report suspicious behavior—one report can make a difference. In addition to the new mobile app, people can call the toll-free State Police Terrorism Tip Line at 1-888-292-1919 or email tips@pa.gov to report suspicious individuals or activity. The Pennsylvania State Police have been receiving terrorism-related tips from the public since 2003. In the case of an immediate threat or emergency, call 9-1-1.",0,8,5
1207,"Editors Note: This story was updated at 4:25 p.m. CST to include updates from officials at a press conference. Seven people have been killed and at least three others wounded in a Sunday morning shooting at the  in Oak Creek. Police said three bodies were found outside the temple at 7512 S. Howell Ave. and four were inside the building. Among the deceased is the gunman, who apparently acted alone. Greenfield Police Chief Bradley Wentlandt told reporters shortly before 2 p.m. that tactical units have gone through the building and have not identified any other shooters. Wentlandt said the Oak Creek police officer who first responded to the call was shot multiple times but is expected to survive. That officer, a 20-year veteran of the department, was in surgery Sunday afternoon, he said. FOX6 News is reporting that Froedtert Hospital said three adult males were at the hospital, being treated for gunshot wounds. All three are in critical condition. Officials are now speaking at a press conference. The Oak Creek Police Chief has said heroic actions of officers stopped it from being worse than it is. Oak Creek Patch Local Editor Mark Schaaf is tweeting live from the temple shooting press conference. https://twitter.com/OakCreekPatch The incident is being treated as domestic terrorism, officials said at the Sunday afternoon press conference. There are no total numbers yet on injuries or deaths, and the temple area is just now being cleared. Police are not releasing information about the suspect, but have confirmed that seven people have died, and three were injured, including an Oak Creek officer who was earlier taken to the hospital. The suspect was killed by Oak Creek police, and no one is in custody. Police believe there was just one shooter. Law enforcement believe the reports of multiple shooters grew out of the many witnesses who saw the same shooter at different angles, but the incident is still under investigation. The FBI is overseeing the criminal investigation. No further information will be released until a press conference at 10 a.m. Monday. The scene outside the temple, which opened in 2007, was somewhat subdued Sunday afternoon as members gathered to get more information on their friends and loved ones. One member of the temple told Patch: We are shocked. We are a peaceful people. One of the leaders of the temple said that after the shooting started, some women hid in a closet for more than an hour. At about 2:30 p.m. CST, temple members were quietly taking in all that had just transpired. There were a few tears, but little public display of emotion. Oak Creek police were having some people who had been in the temple at the time to stay at a bowling alley across the street. The American Red Cross and the Salvation Army also were on the scene to assist temple members. Gurtreet Singh, 27, a member of the temple, described the Sikh community as being very closeknit. As he was talking, he choked up. Im trying to hold it together outside. Inside my insides are being torn apart, he said as he pointed to his heart. He said its difficult right now because theres not a lot of clear information out there. Another person who had friends inside the temple told Patch that the shooting occurred during a morning service as the gunman opened fire on the victims. Another member of the temple told Patch: The priest called from inside (the temple) and said, Send ambulances; send ambulances. Another member, who drives from Madison every Sunday to attend Sikh services in Oak Creek, said: This is disgraceful for the community and the whole world. People come here to worship, pray and express their feelings to God. Its sad that this happened here, and I hope those victimized dont lose their faith in God. Inderjeet Singh Dhillan, another member of the temple who was not inside at the time, said there have been no earlier problems at the Oak Creek facility. This is really scary and really unexpected, he said. One member of the the Sikh temple in Brookfield traveled to Oak Creek as soon as he heard the news. To pull a gun out at the place you go worship — thats shocking, he said. Scanner reports say a witness to the shooting told law enforcement the shooter was a white male, with a heavy build, bald head and wearing a sleeveless T-shirt, and had two handguns. Police departments from throughout the region — including Wauwatosa, Fox Point and Brown Deer, as well as the Milwaukee County Sheriffs Department — responded to the scene. The Flight for Life helicopter also responded to the scene and the FBI has been called in. The White House says that President Barack Obama also has been briefed on the shootings. In statement, Obama said: Michelle and I were deeply saddened to learn of the shooting that tragically took so many lives in Wisconsin. At this difficult time, the people of Oak Creek must know that the American people have them in our thoughts and prayers, and our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who were killed and wounded. As an apparent precaution, several squad cars were stationed at the entrances and exits of the Sikh Temple at 3675 N. Calhoun Road in Brookfield — the only other Sikh temple in the region. The shootings come nearly one year after state Rep. Josh Zepnick and Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm . The temple asked for the meeting because of recent violence against Sikhs in Milwaukee, including the looting of at least one Sikh-owned business. The Sikh community is a strong and positive force within Milwaukees diverse ethnic population, Zepnick at the time. Its unacceptable that they, or any law-abiding business owner, be the target of what appears to be an escalating pattern against certain businesses and segments of the population. The Sikh Temple began with 20 families in rented space in the south side of Milwaukee and has since grown to number in the hundreds. A new Gurudwara was built in Oak Creek to better serve the needs of the growing community. The construction of the 17,500 square-foot Gurudwara was completed in 2007, with parking for 100 cars. Sikh Indians, because of religious tradition, wear turbans to cover their uncut hair and have longer beards. They are often mistaken for Muslims and have been the targets of racially-motivated crimes by anti-Muslim people and groups, as evidenced by the epithets shouted at them. Sundays shooting is similar to an incident in March 2005 in Brookfield, when a gunman killed parishioners during a church service at the Sheraton Hotel in Brookfield where the Living Church of God met regularly. One of their own, long-time church member Terry Ratzmann, 44, of New Berlin, opened fire, killing himself and seven other people. Then-District Attorney Paul Bucher told the Associated Press in August 2005 that Ratzmann executed the pastors family and then randomly opened up fire after that. A clear motive for the Brookfield shooting was never identified. The Sikh American Legal Defense and Education Fund,  a national Sikh American civil rights organization, issued a statement Sunday saying:  Our thoughts and prayers are with the injured, the survivors, their families, and the Oak Creek community.

1210,"The accused killer of 19-year-old University of Pennsylvania student and California native Blaze Bernstein is set to stand trial on a murder charge stemming in connection with the January murder in California. Prosecutors have deemed that the brutal killing of Blaze Bernstein a hate crime because he was gay. Samuel Lincoln Woodward, 21, of Newport Beach, California, is due back in court Sept. 17 for arraignment, according to court officials. He is accused in the killing of Bernstein, a UPenn pre-med student whose body was found in a shallow grave in Borrego Park in Lake Forest early in 2018. Bernstein was reportedly stabbed 20 times. Woodward was arrested on Jan. 12 in California, just days after Bernsteins found was found on Jan. 9. He was subsequently charged with murder and hate crimes in connection with the death, as authorities said Woodward killed Blaze, because Blaze was gay. Wooodward and Bernstein were classmates in High School at the Orange County School of the Arts in Santa Ana and reconnected over social media. We will prove that Woodward Killed Blaze because Blaze was gay, District Attorney Tony Rackauckas said at a press conference in August. The evidence was developed by examining Woodwards cell phone, laptop, social media and other digital evidence revealing the dark side of Woodwards thoughts and intentions. Woodwards attorney, Ed Munoz, previously said he and his clients family were deeply disappointed that the complaint was amended to allege the defendant carried out the killing due to Bernsteins sexual orientation. This is a complex case and the motivations each of the principals brought with them to that fateful meeting are multi-layered and theyre really complicated, so I guess from the narrow or selective view of the evidence this amended filing is not completely shocking, Munoz said on Aug. 2.

Wayne Falgiani, 60, of Dormont, was charged after the Dec. 19 incident. Dormont police responded to Slapshots on West Liberty Avenue at 7:15 p.m. on Dec. 19 after a witness called to report that a man was outside, yelling racial slurs and profanity at two women. The man, later identified as Falgiani, was not on the scene when officers arrived. According to the police report, the women told the officers they were sitting behind a vehicle on West Liberty Avenue that was stopped in the lane. When the driver honked her cars horn, Falgiani got out of his car and began screaming at the women. The women—one of whom was pregnant—told police that when they drove away from the scene, Falgiani got back into his car and proceeded to follow them through the borough, despite their attempts to lose him by making several turns onto neighborhood roads. The women then said they stopped at the Exxon station on West Liberty Avenue in Dormont, hoping they would be safe with more people around. But, they told police, Falgiani stopped there, too, got out of his car and began hitting and punching the womens car. The women drove away again and stopped near Slapshots, at which point, they told police, Falgiani again got out of his car, threw his jacket to the ground and began screaming at the women and yelling racial slurs. At that point, a witness yelled that he was calling police, and Falgiani left the scene in his car, according to the report. While officers were speaking with the two women near Slapshots, police said Falgiani came to the Dormont Police Department himself and attempted to file a complaint against the two women. According to the police report, Falgiani later admitted during an interview with police that he did yell at the women and follow them in his car, and that he had approached them outside of Slapshots, citing that he felt a need to defend himself.

According to the police report, the men walked into Vasta and began yelling racial slurs at a couple sitting at the bar, then assaulted both people. At the time, witnesses were unable to give statements in support of either group, according to the report. Police reviewed surveillance tape from inside the bar, which led to the arrests.

1219,"Violent rape that led to injury, and later a fatal painkiller addiction. Dozens of boys who were fondled after the priest told them he was doing a cancer check. A family of five sisters all sexually abused in perverse and obscene ways by the same priest. A group of altar boys allegedly repeatedly touched and groped after being told to come naked under their cassocks because God didnt want any man-made clothes to be worn next to their skin while they were serving Mass. These are just some of the disturbing allegations contained in a scathing, 1,350-page report released Tuesday by a grand jury in Pennsylvania. The report, which was years in the making, details the alleged widespread sexual abuse of more than 1,000 child victims by 300 priests in six of Pennsylvanias eight dioceses. The grand jury said it subpoenaed and reviewed half a million pages of internal diocesan documents, which contained credible allegations against the hundreds of alleged predator priests in the dioceses of Allentown, Erie, Greensburg, Harrisburg, Pittsburgh and Scranton. The results are hard to stomach: the grand jury alleges thousands of child victims were manipulated by priests, often with alcohol or pornography. In many cases they were raped, and in nearly every case they were brushed aside by church leaders who preferred to protect the abusers and their institution above all, the grand jury report states. The bulk of the report, which has been described as the biggest and most exhaustive ever investigation into priest sex abuse by an individual state, covers events that occurred before the early 2000s. And even though there are 300 priests named, the grand jury notes: We should emphasize that, while the list of priests is long, we dont think we got them all. Here are six of the most startling accusations included in the report, which you can read in its entirety by clicking here: 1.) Rev. Edward R. Graff of the Allentown Diocese is accused of raping a boy multiple times. In one particularly violent assault, Graff pushed down on the victims back with such force that it injured him, the report states. The victim was later prescribed painkillers, and has since passed away from addiction to those painkillers. The victims mother testified before the grand jury, saying despite the assaults, her son had kept the faith and even requested a Catholic funeral mass. Religion was very important to him and he was so afraid of going to hell that I think that is why he stuck with it, his mother told the grand jury. 2.) Father Chester Gawronski of the Diocese of Erie is accused of fondling dozens of young boys on multiple occasions from 1976 to 1977 under the pretext of showing them how to check for cancer, the grand jury report said. In 1987, Gawronski provided the diocese with a list of 41 possible victims, confirming that he had performed the cancer check on least 12 of them. Despite the fact that complaints mounted, Gawronski was approved to hear confessions for persons with disabilities. In 1997, church leadership sent him a letter thanking him for all that you have done for Gods people during those twenty-one years of ordination. Only the Lord knows the many acts of kindnesses on your part and the deep faith that you have shown. The Lord, who sees in private, will reward. 3.) Father William Presley of the Diocese of Erie is accused of sexually assaulting victims over the course of 16 years. One victim told the grand jury that Presley invited him to the rectory and tried to hypnotize him before assaulting him. Presley taught the victim how to have sexual intercourse by bringing in a female high school student and using index cards to show them where to touch each other, the grand jury report said. On more than one occasion, the victim said Presley gave him some type of a sedative to relax him prior to abusing him. Presley stated that it was okay because he was a priest. 4.) Father Edmon A. Parrakow, who served at St. Pius X Catholic Church in Mount Pleasant, allegedly told altar boys not to wear any clothing under their cassocks because God didnt want any man-made clothes to be worn next to their skin while they were serving Mass. Another victim reported that Parrakow took the altar boys into a private room and told them he had to do a physical examination on them, during which he would touch them all over, including their genitals and buttocks, the report said. 5.) Father Gus Giella in Harrisburg allegedly abused five sisters in a single family. The grand jury report said he was found to have collected samples of their urine, blood, and pubic hair. He allegedly applied a device to the toilet to collect the samples, which he would sometimes ingest, the report said. After his house was searched and his collection was located, the diocese remained unwilling to remove him. At this point we are at impasse - allegations and no admission, a high-ranking church official reportedly said. The priest did admit to his actions years later. 6.) Father Michael Lawrence, while a priest at a Reading church, is accused of sexually assaulting a 12-year-old boy by fondling his genitals to the point of pain. After the boys father told church leadership of the assault, Lawrence was confronted. Please help me. I sexually molested a young boy, he admitted, the grand jury report said. Records indicate that Lawrence was sent to St. John Vianney Center the same day he confessed. Church leaders, in a document obtained by the grand jury, wrote they had spoke to the doctor, who informed him that the family of the victim should be given time to ventilate and what the victim experienced may not be a horrendous trauma for the boy. According to the report, which was initially blocked from release after legal challenges were filed, almost every instance of alleged abuse found is too old to be prosecuted. The grand jury has recommended four changes in response to its findings: First, eliminate the criminal statute of limitations for sexually abusing children. Next, create a two-year civil window for child sex abuse victims who couldnt file lawsuits before. Third, penalties for a continuing failure to report child abuse must be clarified. And lastly, prohibit non-disclosure agreements regarding cooperation with law enforcement. We want future victims to know they will always have the force of the criminal law behind them, no matter how long they live. And we want future child predators to know they should always be looking over their shoulder - no matter how long they live, the report said. The Pennsylvania Attorney Generals office is asking additional victims to come forward. A clergy abuse hotline has been established. That number is 888-538-8541.

1220,"The explosions began in early April. They were loud, residents said. So loud they would shake walls and furniture. One woman, home with her children during the most recent blast, said it made a bookshelf topple over. Some left craters as large as four feet wide. Usually they happened overnight, in the hours leading up to dawn. Theories swirled. A sense of unrest settled into this rural pocket of Bucks County. Residents in areas like Milford Township, Richland Township, Quakertown, and Nockamixin Township awaited the next one. Would it be in the middle of the night, like the last one? And, more importantly, would anyone get hurt? The answer to that question, nearly three months later, is thankfully no. While we can answer that question, there are many more that, like the explosions that preceded them, remain a mystery. Early morning raid nets suspect — and WMD in rural Pennsylvania community After approximately 30 explosions, which began April 1 and extended through June 14, 30-year-old David W. Surman Jr. was arrested early Thursday morning. The arrest followed an extensive investigation by the FBI, Pennsylvania State Police, the ATF, and Bucks County Detectives that led authorities to an 18-inch weapon of mass destruction at his Mildford Township property, the District Attorney announced Thursday. Officials raided his properties on North Old Bethlehem Pike and Spinnerstown Road before dawn. Roads were closed and neighbors were abuzz about what was going on. By the afternoon it was clear: In addition to the WMD, multiple other explosives were found, as well as many, many chemicals for bomb making, said Bucks County District Attorney Matthew Weintraub. Suspected methamphetamine as well as 10 firearms were also located at the sites, prosecutors said. Weintraub, in a Thursday afternoon press conference, praised the collaboration of law enforcement agencies in locating Surman before anyone was hurt. As of now, Surman is charged only in connection with the materials found on his properties Thursday, not with anything related to the rash of explosions. Charges include four felony counts of unlawful possession or manufacture of a weapon of mass destruction, and misdemeanor counts of drug possession and weapons charges, among others. However, the seized materials will be sent to FBI labs in Quantico, Va., Weintraub said. Officials say they hope a forensic analysis will match them to evidence collected at the detonation sites. Weintraub said that Surman was identified as a suspect in the explosions after around-the-clock surveillance by investigators. Seven detonation sites were found in close proximity to Surmans home and business, investigators said. Prosecutors say Surman told investigators that two of the suspected bombs found in his home contained flash powder, while the other two contained erythritol tetranitrate. Both are explosive materials, the probable cause affidavit said. Who is David W. Surman Jr.?  Surman is the owner of Consolidated Chemical & Solvents, located on Spinnerstown Road. The company says on its website that it sells chemicals to industrial clients, educational facilities, and research laboratories. We offer a large selection of products in our online store, and have many others by customer request, the website boasts. Surman has been in a zoning dispute with Milford Township in connection with the company for some time, according to The Morning Call. In 2013, he had been granted a variance to sell, repair and store scientific and light industrial equipment at the Spinnerstown Road property. But after a fire there in 2017, the township issued a violation notice because inspectors determined he constructed an addition without a permit and was storing large quantities of chemicals, The Morning Call reported. He appealed the violation notice, which was then upheld by the board and the case is now pending in Bucks County Court. What exactly Surman intended to do with the alleged explosive devices is unclear at this point. The District Attorney has declined to speculate about Surmans motives, saying there is no evidence he is a member of any hate groups. However, a notebook with troubling hand-drawn illustrations was located at Surmans residence, and officials shared those pages with reporters. The drawn images, created with magic marker on looseleaf pages, feature a swastika, a burning cross, obscenities directed at federal agencies, and disparaging words about gay people. (See the notebook pages here.) RELATED: God Save Us Now: See The Alleged Bucks County Bombers Notebook Investigation goes on While authorities say theyre satisfied that they have apprehended the person responsible for the blasts, the investigation is ongoing. Surman is being held at Bucks County prison after being unable to make bail, which was set at $750,000, 10 percent cash. The judge ordered him to surrender his passport and possess no guns or chemicals that could be used in explosives. (UPDATE: Surman posted bail Friday.) He defines a danger to the community. I have no doubt that if he gets out, he will go back home and continue what he has been doing, said First Assistant District Attorney Gregg D. Shore, who has been assigned to prosecute the case. We are one step away from someone being seriously injured. Meanwhile, officials are urging residents to call 911 if they come across anything they think might be an unexploded bomb. Anyone having information that could help the investigation should call the FBI at 1-800-CALLFBI and select Option 4 on the menu. In addition to Pennsylvania State Police, the FBI, the ATF, and the Bucks County Detectives, several local departments assisted, including Richland Township, Quakertown Borough, the Montgomery County Bomb Squad, among others. This is a great example of where collaboration across local, state and federal agencies has saved human life, Weintraub said. RELATED COVERAGE Main image of Surman via Bucks DA",0,8,5
1221,"The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has blocked the release of a grand jury report detailing widespread sexual abuse within the Catholic Church in six of the states eight dioceses. In an order issued Wednesday, the Supreme Court has issued a stay of proceedings to review legal challenges that sought to prevent its release. And now, this 20th day of June, 2018, the Applications for Stay are GRANTED. The Honorable Norman A. Krumenacker, III, and the Office of the Attorney General are enjoined from releasing Report No. 1 of the 40th Statewide Investigating Grand Jury pending further order of this Court. The instant order is unsealed. All other materials at these docket numbers are not presently publicly available, the order reads. Last month, Attorney General Josh Shapiro said he had planned to speak in June about the comprehensive grand jury report, which is nearly two years in the making. Described by the Associated Press as the biggest and most exhaustive ever investigation into priest sex abuse by an individual state, the grand jury report details allegations at six of Pennsylvanias eight dioceses, including Allentown, Erie, Greensburg, Harrisburg, Pittsburgh and Scranton. RELATED: Widespread Sex Abuse By PA Priests To Be Revealed In Report: AG Shapiro, in a statement issued after the Pennsylvania Supreme Courts order, said he will continue fighting tirelessly to make sure the victims of this abuse are able to tell their stories and the findings of this investigation are made public to the people of Pennsylvania. The individuals or institutions who presented legal challenges to prevent the reports release were not named. The grand jury investigation will reveal potentially damaging information that not only shows there was widespread abuse, but also efforts to conceal and protect abusive priests, according to the Associated Press. It is not the first time the states Catholic churches have come under scrutiny. In 2016, a Pennsylvania grand jury investigated the Altoona-Johnstown diocese. A report released after that investigation revealed hundreds of children were subjected to abuse that was masked by two bishops who averted probes into the claims and created a payout chart to quietly compensate victims based on the level of abuse. RELATED: Catholic Bishops Hid Sex Abuse Of Hundreds Of PA Children: Grand Jury More than 50 priests and religious leaders who served at churches across the state were implicated in a sex-abuse scandal dating back 40 years, the investigation into Altoona-Johnstown revealed.

1222,"A Pennsylvania church is getting national attention for a controversial blessing ceremony it is planning this week that involves firearms similar to the one used during the Feb. 14 massacre at a Florida high school. World Peace and Unification Sanctuary church in Wayne County is holding a blessing ceremony Wednesday for couples with AR-15 rifles. The event, called Cosmic True Parents of Heaven, Earth and Humanity Cheon Il Guk Book of Life Registration Blessing, will be held a half mile from Wallenpaupack South Elementary School. As a precautionary measure, students will be moved from that school on the day of the event and transported to the districts other elementary school due to traffic concerns and the nature of this event, Wallenpaupack Area School District Superintendent Michael Silsby said in a letter to parents. All heterosexual couples are invited to the blessing, the church says on its website, which has a full page designated to the details about the Feb. 28 event. Couples participating are requested to bring a rod of iron, which the church defines as an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle or equivalent, including an AK semiautomatic rifle. Couples unable to get a rod of iron in time should buy a $700 gift certificate from a gun store, as evidence of their intent to purchase a rod of iron in the future, the church said. The church is led by Hyung Jin Moon, the son of the late Rev. Sun Myung Moon and is an offshoot of the controversial Unification Church founded in the 1950s. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups, has called Hyung Jin Moon an anti-LGBT cult leader. Faithful brothers and sisters under True Fathers authority can receive the grace of participating on February 28, 2018 in the Cheon Il Guk Book of Life Registration Blessing which is the final, perfection level Blessing that True Father instructed all blessed couples to complete. This ceremony will be officiated by Hyung Jin Moon, True Fathers anointed heir, and True Mother Hyun Shil Kang, the church says on its website. The weapons represent both the intent and the ability to defend ones family, community and nation of Cheon Il Guk. The blessing follows Sanctuary Churchs President Trump Thank You Dinner, which was held on Feb. 24. An AR-15 was to be raffled off at the event, the church said in a press release.

1226,"The details of a grand jury investigation into Pennsylvania Catholic church sex abuse against children announced Tuesday were both horrific and shocking in scale — involving more than 50 religious leaders, hundreds of children over a span of at least 40 years. But if you expect the revelations to lead to a wave of criminal prosecutions and hard time for pedophile priests, guess again: not a single one of the perpetrators involved can be criminally prosecuted, according to Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen G. Kane. There are several reasons the abusers will escape justice. Many of the alleged predators have already died. Some traumatized victims dont want to testify, perhaps out of shame or else lingering doubt that doing so will lead to prosecution for acts that occurred long ago. But at least a few will escape charges because of a legal technicality: the statute of limitations for their alleged crimes has expired. The grand jury hearing the case was rightly outraged over this fact, and went so far as to recommend a drastic measure — the elimination of all statutes of limitations for criminal cases of sexual assault against minors. Such a move is far from unprecedented. Thirty-two states already have no criminal statute of limitations for some forms of child sexual assault, according to SOL-Reform.com. These laws vary wildly from state to state based on factors like age, the presence of DNA and whether or not threat of force was used, but the intention, broadly, is both clear and just: to prevent sexual predators from running out the clock on their crimes. The Catholic church has a dark history of sexual abuse and cover-ups in the United States, which began to come to light in the 1980s. Criminal prosecutions, though, havent always been handed down for many of the reasons Kane cited in the Pennsylvania case. Because of longstanding cover ups, the criminal statutes of limitations had expired for the vast majority of perpetrators, Marci Hamilton, a professor of law at Yeshiva University and founder of SOL-Reform.com, told Patch. And the hierarchy in the church has been even more unlikely to be charged. The conviction of a Louisiana pastor in 1985 is regarded as one of the first modern cases of sex abuse in the church. Gilbert Gauthe, a former Roman Catholic priest in a small Louisiana parish was charged with 34 counts of child molestation in 1985. Gauthe ultimately served 10 years after pleading guilty to 11 counts of aggravated crime against nature and other crimes. In April 2015, Pope Francis accepted the resignation of a Missouri bishop who waited six months before notifying police of a reverend in his diocese whose computer contained lewd photos of young girls taken in and around churches where he worked. The Rev. Shawn Ratigan was sentenced to 50 years in prison after pleading guilty in 2012 to child pornography charges. Perhaps one of the most notable cases in sex abuse cover up by the church was brought to light by a group of Boston Globe reporters in 2002, the subject of the movie Spotlight, which Sunday won Best Picture at the Academy Awards. The Globe investigation found that Archbishop of Boston Cardinal Bernard Francis Law covered up dozens of cases of sexual abuse committed by priests in the Boston area. While 25 priests were removed from their positions, only five were criminally charged. Law ultimately submitted his resignation in 2002 and moved to Rome, under protection of the Church. If the statute of limitations is eliminated in Pennsylvania, as the grand jury has recommended, Hamilton said, charges will still not be brought against the priests subject to the most recent Pennsylvania Attorney Generals investigation. The U.S. Supreme Court in 2003 ruled in favor of an accused child molester who was charged after California extended its statute of limitations in the 1990s.The court ruled that Stogner couldnt be charged after all, since the statute of limitations in place when he allegedly committed the crime had expired. Under Pennsylvania law, sexual assault victims under the age of 18 have until their 30th birthday to file criminal charges if they were born before August 27, 2002. Victims over the age of 18 have 12 years to report the assault. On August 27, 2002 a new state law was implemented that increased the statute of limitations to 32 years, but it only applies to people born after it was enacted. Bill Cosbys Pennsylvania criminal charges for a 2004 sexual assault of a Temple University employee were brought just days before the statute expired. Cosbys case and the Penn State child rape case, among others, have spurred calls for abolishing the criminal statute of limitations altogether in cases of rape, especially when children are involved. In the case of a child, the power differential between the perpetrator and the child is so extreme, Hamilton said. Its unreasonable to expect that child to come forward immediately. Kane urged anyone with knowledge of abuse at the Roman Catholic Diocese of Altoona-Johnstown to contact the Office of the Attorney General at 888-538-8541, a toll-free, dedicated hotline established for the case. This is by no means the end of our investigation. We will continue to look at this matter and consider charges where appropriate, which is why it is so important for those with information to come forward, Kane said. At the very least we must continue to shine a light on this long period of abuse and despicable conduct.",0,8,5
1227,"A Pennsylvania grand jury implicated more than 50 priests and religious leaders who have served at churches across the state in a sex-abuse scandal dating back 40 years. The Pennsylvania Attorney General announced the findings of a two-year investigation into the Roman Catholic Diocese of Altoona-Johnstown Tuesday, saying hundreds of children were subjected to abuse that was masked by two bishops who averted probes into the claims and created a payout chart to quietly compensate victims based on the level of abuse. A 147-page grand jury report made public Tuesday describes a predatory abattoir of youthful innocence in which boys were hypnotized and made to drink alcohol to soften them up for priests to molest and rape. Witnesses say one priest molested the children while listening to Bill Cosby records. Some were abused in their sleep, investigators found. Others were forced to go nude beneath their robes so a priest could grope their genitals, the report revealed. Criminal charges are not being filed because many of the priests accused of abuse have died and the statute of limitations has expired. Investigators say the scandal was covered up by two of the dioceses bishops, who together have headed the diocese since 1966. One of the bishops even created a pay out chart detailing cash payments to be given to victims based on the type of the abuse reported. Predator after predator came before the grand jury to testify, with many of the alleged predators saying this was the first time law enforcement ever questioned them.  Victims, male and female children as young as 6, reported genital fondling and said they were forced to participate in or watch masturbation, the report said. Children said they were forced to perform or receive oral sex from priests and some reported being anally raped.  The grand jury heard evidence alcohol and pornography were provided to children. Additionally, the report reveals the abuse was reported by family members to law enforcement, including the Pennsylvania State Police. Charges were not pressed and leaders at the diocese instead assured investigators the priests in question would be removed and institutionalized.  Bishop James Hogan and Bishop Joseph Adamec did not report the behavior, the investigation revealed. Instead they chose to shield the institution and themselves, the report said.  Because of their choices and failed leadership, hundreds of children suffered, according to the grand jury report. The details of the accusations are revealed in detail in the grand jury report. Priests allegedly used alcohol and hypnosis to coerce children into the sexual behavior, which happened in rectories, parish offices, cars and on trips, the pages and pages of findings reveal. Children recalled specific details, including one priest who would grope children while listening to Bill Cosby comedy albums. That same priest, Father George Koharchik, admitted to the grand jury he was close to a dozen children. Koharchik said he viewed the sexual encounters as emotional connections and he certainly did not think of it as predatory. In many cases, priests continued to minister following molestation allegations. For example, Monsignor Thomas Mabon was accused of molesting an altar boy at St. Marys Church in Hollidaysburg but was allowed to return to active ministry after treatment that would require him to self report those things that he felt were issues, witnesses testified to the grand jury. In another startling testimony, witnesses say Monsignor Francis McCaa preyed on a child who sought solace after his fathers death. McCaa, a highly respected religious leader in his community who died in 2007, was billed a monster by investigators. The grand jury alleges McCaa would victimize altar boys, making them take their pants off under their cassocks so he could reach under to touch and squeeze their genitals.  Nearly every known victim indicated that Father McCaa sexually offended on them in almost every interaction which would permit physical contact, the report said. As part of an effort to cover up the abuse, Bishop Adamec created a pay out chart, the investigation found. For example, victims who were fondled above clothing were given $10,000 to $25,000. Those who were subjected to fondling under clothing or masturbation received $15,000 to $40,000. Victims made to perform or receive oral sex received $25,000 to $75,000 under the bishops payout chart. Rape victims were supposed to receive $50,000 to $175,000, the grand jury found. The payout chart had footnotes outlining factors to consider for valuation within a range. Those factors included duration of abuse, age of victims, use of alcohol or drugs and the psychological impact of the abuse on the individual. The bishops avoided investigation into the claims and instead would use code words like sick leave and nervous exhaustion to justify moving alleged predator priests to another location, the grand jury found. Saint John Vianney Center in Downingtown was one location used to provide cover for bishops, the report said. As a result of the investigation, the grand jury is recommending abolishing the statute of limitations for sexual offenses against minors and is urging the state General Assembly to suspend the civil statute of limitations on sexual abuse claims.

1228,"Michael Muretta struggled for years with mental illness. His struggle reached a horrific end last August when the 47-year-old Williams Township man struck himself in the head with a hammer, causing fatal injuries. That was the conclusion reached by investigators looking into Murettas death, Northampton County District Attorney John Morganelli said Thursday. At a news conference at his office, Morganelli told reporters that Murettas history --combined with physical evidence at his home and no evidence of anyone who wished him harm -- will lead the coroner to rule his death a suicide. Its not clear whether Murettta intended to kill himself. The hammer blows may have been a response to the symptoms of the schizophrenia Muretta suffered from, which included hearing voices. His death may have been an unintended consequence, Morganelli said, but also noted that suicides often dont seem to make sense. Mental illness is not rational. Muretta was found inside his home on Morgan Hill Road on the afternoon of Aug. 29, after state police came to check on him. In the days leading up to his death, people close to him noticed a change. There were signs of depression, Morganelli said, and also a preoccupation with religious issues. (Investigators would later find a Bible and computer printouts of religious-themed webpages inside the home.) There was a real concern about his well-being, Morganelli said. Police found Muretta still alive, but unresponsive and suffering from head injuries. He was taken to St. Lukes University Hospital and died later that day. At the time, police deemed his death suspicious. But as they investigated, police found no evidence of anyone else inside the home, Morganelli said. All the doors were locked, and there was no sign anyone had come in or out of the only open window in the house. A blood spatter expert found that the void that exists in homicide cases -- caused by blood splashing onto a killer -- wasnt present here. And the wounds on Murettas head were all concentrated in the same area, Morganelli said. Thats not what a murder-by-hammer would look like. Youll see multiple wounds on the skull, he said. Its usually a crime of passion. Police also found no indication of anyone who wanted to harm Muretta. Then there was his long psychiatric history, Morganelli said. In 1986, in Alpha, NJ, Muretta stabbed one of his neighbors, but was found not guilty by reason of insanity. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia. His doctors said he suffered from delusions, and heard voices. He had been seeking treatment in the past few years, but had stopped at the time of his death, Morganelli said. One of Murettas relatives told police she had been urging him to get help. She was trying to get him to take his meds, but obviously, he wasnt, he said. Murettas autopsy showed no medication in his system, although medication to treat depression was found at the home.

1229,"Michael Muretta had struggled for years with mental illness. His struggle reached a horrific end last August when the 47-year-old Williams Township man struck himself in the head with a hammer, causing fatal injuries. That was the conclusion reached by investigators looking into Murettas death, Northampton County District Attorney John Morganelli said Thursday. At a news conference at his office, Morganelli told reporters that Murettas history --combined with physical evidence at his home and no evidence of anyone who wished him harm -- will lead the coroner to rule his death a suicide. Its not clear whether Murettta intended to kill himself. The hammer blows may have been a response to the symptoms of the schizophrenia Muretta suffered from, which included hearing voices. His death may have been an unintended consequence, Morganelli said, but also noted that suicides often dont seem to make sense. Mental illness is not rational. Muretta was found inside his home on Morgan Hill Road on the afternoon of Aug. 29, after state police came to check on him. In the days leading up to his death, people close to him noticed a change. There were signs of depression, Morganelli said, and also a preoccupation with religious issues. (Investigators would later find a Bible and computer printouts of religious-themed webpages inside the home.) There was a real concern about his well-being, Morganelli said. Police found Muretta still alive, but unresponsive and suffering from head injuries. He was taken to St. Lukes University Hospital and died later that day. At the time, police deemed his death suspicious. But as they investigated, police found no evidence of anyone else inside the home, Morganelli said. All the doors were locked, and there was no sign anyone had come in or out of the only open window in the house. A blood spatter expert found that the void that exists in homicide cases -- caused by blood splashing onto a killer -- wasnt present here. And the wounds on Murettas head were all concentrated in the same area, Morganelli said. Thats not what a murder-by-hammer would look like. Youll see multiple wounds on the skull, he said. Its usually a crime of passion. Police also found no indication of anyone who wanted to harm Muretta. Then there was his long psychiatric history, Morganelli said. In 1986, in Alpha, NJ, Muretta stabbed one of his neighbors, but was found not guilty by reason of insanity. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia. His doctors said he suffered from delusions, and heard voices. He had been seeking treatment in the past few years, but had stopped at the time of his death, Morganelli said. One of Murettas relatives told police she had been urging him to get help. She was trying to get him to take his meds, but obviously, he wasnt, he said. Murettas autopsy showed no medication in his system, although medication to treat depression was found at the home. Morganelli said he met with members of Murettas family Thursday morning, and said that some of them accepted these findings. Murettas ex-wife told the Express-Times earlier this week that she thought his death was a homicide. The investigation is closed, Morganelli said, unless new evidence surfaces.

1232,"Allegheny County Chief of Emergency Services Alvin Henderson, Jr. and Allegheny County Police Superintendent Charles Moffatt urge residents to continue to remain vigilant in their communities and if they see something, say something. With efforts by the Pennsylvania State Police, residents can now send something too. With the recent explosions in Boston, we are reminded once again that we must remain vigilant and aware of what is going on around us in our communities, said Henderson. Federal, state and local officials continue to work together with first responders and the private sector to protect our communities, but the residents are really our eyes and ears. While many reports are for harmless items that were left behind or forgotten, Superintendent Moffatt said that may not always be the case and relaying the information is easier now than ever before. The PA State Police have launched a new smartphone application that allows a person to take a photograph or send a note about suspicious activity that they have seen, which then goes directly to the Pennsylvania Criminal Intelligence Center for evaluation and assignment to an investigator, as appropriate, he said. Both officials reminded residents that factors such as race, ethnicity, national origin or religion affiliation along are not suspicious activity. The public should report suspicious behavior and situations rather than beliefs, thoughts, ideas, expressions, association or speech unrelated to criminal activity. There has been an increase in reports since the Boston Marathon. For comparison, there were 186 incidents of suspicious activity reported in the week prior to the Marathon (April 7-13), and 311 incidents reported in the week following (April 14-20). Chief Henderson said that is neither unusual, nor a negative as officials would rather be safe and check into any reports when they are received. Superintendent Moffatt agrees. One report can make a difference. We investigate all criminal activity and provide assistance to our local police departments and criminal justice agencies.  Without the cooperation of residents, and their awareness, our job becomes even more difficult.  If you see something, you should say something, he said.

1236,"by Tech. Sgt. Andria AllmondHORSHAM AIR GUARD STATION, Pa. -- It was Friday the 13th of May, and an ominous figure was lumbering forward through an office building here. The sound of erratic gunshots echoed down the hallways. Exercise, exercise, exercise! yelled an unspecified voice trailing the aggressor. The clarification didnt lower the volume of the mock gunfire. The red-vested pretend assailant kept advancing, firing blank rounds within the confines of the office structure. Through the din, the trailing voice reassuringly repeated, Exercise, exercise, exercise! Guardsmen of the 111th Attack Wing and first responders from Horsham Township, Pennsylvania, were participating in a major accident response exercise involving an active shooter and mass causalities. But unlike some military installations, when the 111th ATKW conducts a MARE, the exercise isnt isolated to base personnel. In fact, local agencies such as Pennsylvanias Montgomery County SWAT team, Horsham Police and Fire Departments play as important a role as the military units. We all live and work in Horsham Township and have a duty to serve our community to the best of our abilities, said Horsham Township Police Department Lt. K. John Potts. Exercises like the one that took place on Friday can help identify problems before an incident occurs, as well as foster an opportunity for members of the police department and the [Air National Guard] to build working relationships with one another. A MARE is a military training requirement that consists of simulated emergency events. The responses to those events are evaluated by wing inspection team members based on the Air Forces four major graded areas. Those responses are then generated into a report by inspectors who are present to witness the entire exercise. That report is then uploaded into a tracking system and reviewed by the installation commander, who can theninitiate any necessary remediation. For nearly four years, the wing has included nonmilitary first responders, and the results have been encouraging. Id say that from when we first brought the local authorities about four years ago, weve improved a good 80 to 85 percent, said Chief Master Sgt. Jim Tobolski, 111th ATKW project manager. If I have to pick out one areathat we still need to work on, it is that there are so many cops that could respond, and not all of them have been here to do it. Base familiarity is the key, and the goal is seamless reaction -- and were getting pretty close. Potts said the joint exercises on the base offer a test for responding Horsham police officers to locate specific streets and buildings on the base. When we are called to assist the [111th ATKW] with an actual event, we want our officers familiar enough with the layout of the base that they can locate the address and building quickly, he said. Sometimes, training can be reduced to the rote minutia of its elements --exercises beget inspections beget reports beget lessons learned. But an active-shooter MARE is something beyond that. Its simply about saving lives. This training can mean the difference between life and death, said Master Sgt. Geoffrey Gay, the notional active shooter and a 201st RED HORSE Det.1 member. When its over and youre able to recall what actually happenedduring the exercise, you can go back to these people and say Heres where you messed up. or Heres what you did right. Its good to know what works, Potts said, but its more important to know what doesnt work. That, he said, can mean the difference between someone being injured or killed. Creating realistic MARE scenarios that help keep people alive is largely about increasing everyones situational awareness, Gay said. The climate of danger and violence is different than it was 20 years ago, he added. Takeyour beak outta your phone once in a while and look around.",0,8,5

1239,"A black person in Pennsylvania is more than five times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than a white person, at least according to one study. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) conducted a study looking at marijuana possession arrests between 2001 and 2010. The group found a national disparity between the arrest rates of white people and black people for the same crime. On average, a black person is 3.73 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than a white person, even though blacks and whites use marijuana at similar rates, the studys report says. The findings say that this  disparity exists in all regions of the country … with large and small black populations. The report states that black people are 5.19 times more likely to be arrested for possession in Pennsylvania than white people are, making the state one of the top-10 in the nation for this disparity. Pennsylvania was one of the states with the highest marijuana possession rates. More than 21,000 possession arrests were made in 2010 alone, the study states. According to the arrest statistics in the study, which were provided by the FBI, 40 percent of possession arrests in 2010 were black. Pennsylvanias black population makes up 11 percent of the states total residents. The ACLU study suggests that legalizing marijuana use for people age 21 and older could be a way to reduce both racial disparities and costs to the states. The most effective way to eliminate arrests for marijuana use and possessions [and] the racial disparities among such arrests … is to legalize marijuana. Pennsylvania spent more than $100 million on marijuana enforcement in 2010. Check out the chart below to see what the arrest disparity is in the Greater Philadelphia Area: *Note: The study did not include a county breakdown for Chester County, but did note that the county was equal to or above the countrys arrest disparity.

1246,"- Seven Spring City deaths were among the 97 drug overdoses in Chester County in 2016, according to information provided by the Chester County Coroners Office. The statistics paint a sobering picture of the impact which the national epidemic has had upon the local community. Victims from across geographical locations, racial backgrounds, and ages died from accidental overdoses last year. Most of the deaths involved opioids of some kind, and had often been mixed with alcohol and other drugs. The seven deaths in Spring City are listed below: Overdoses were not concentrated in one area of the county, but were spread largely evenly in rural and more suburban areas, from Upper Oxford and New Garden to Malvern and West Chester. Many of the overdoses involved fentanyl, a drug that Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele called 50 times more deadly than heroin. Nearby, there were six overdoses in Phoenixville, six in West Chester, five in Tredyffrin, two in East Whiteland, and one in Malvern. Officials are attacking the opioid epidemic on multiple fronts. One of the most impactful has been the prescription drug collection initiatives, which in 2016 resulted in 8,000 pounds of drugs being collected from throughout the county. According to District Attorney Tom Hogan, Chester County has the lowest overdose rate in southeastern Pennsyvlania, although numbers on the county, region, state, and national level continue to rise. Editors note: these statistics reflect the most recently available data from the Chester Countys Coroners Office.

I know that I have made some poor decisions … that do not line up with who I am or what I believe. I know that over the weeks and months to come, I will have some hard decisions to make. Gamrat offered a letter of apology to House Minority Leader Tim Greimel, D-Auburn Hills, and asked if she could read it personally. Greimel refused, saying that would be highly unusual, according to the Detroit Free Press. There are very serious criminal allegations here and a law enforcement agency with subpoena power needs to get involved here and investigate, Greimel said. If the allegations against them are true and thats an open question – misusing taxpayer funded staff time and then firing the staff when they refused to go along with the scheme – thats a very serious allegation and they should leave the House immediately. Speaker of the House Kevin Cotter, R-Mt. Pleasant, ordered an investigation of Courser and Gamrat to determine if they used taxpayer money to hide their relationship. They could face criminal charges or be ordered to make restitution. The investigation also includes allegations that Courser improperly fired aides who refused to go along with a bizarre misinformation campaign in which sexually explicit emails accusing Courser – a staunch gay marriage opponent – of having sex with a male prostitute were sent to Republicans and reporters in May. Courser, who admitted to orchestrating the cover-up and acknowledged he was a hypocrite, said he figured the fake scandal would be so over the top that no one would believe it, and would deflect attention away from the real extramarital affair with Gamrat. In addition to the legislative oversight, the Michigan State Police launched an investigation Friday after Courser visited the Lapeer post of his own accord, the Free Press said. MSP spokeswoman Shannon Banner declined to reveal the nature of the investigation. Gamrat has denied her involvement in the cover-up scheme, and Courser has since said the email was an attempt to draw out a blackmailer associated with the Lansing mafia establishment – political enemies he accused of colluding with former staffers Ben Graham, Joshua Cline and Keith Allard. Both Courser, 43, and Gamrat, 42, are freshmen legislators with tea party backing. Both are married. He has four children and she has three. Both are religious conservatives. One of the former aides, Cline, said at a Monday news conference that the relationship between the two was so openly intimate that it created a hostile work environment. Courser and Gamrat would routinely disappear for hours at a time, then return to office and ask staffers to get dinner for them, Cline said. Courser often took naps in Gamrats office, and she would get him a pillow and tuck him in, the former aide aid. They spent an inordinate amount of time going for walks with each other during the day, Cline said. They frequently greeted each other with what appeared to be long, romantic, highly personal hugs and embraces. Cline said he began to suspect in January that the two were having an affair, but when he suggested they should adopt and enforce professional and personal boundaries, Courser and Gamrat dismissed his concerns and impressed upon me that as a mere staffer, such a suggestion was not my place. Gamrats husband, Joe, confronted the two legislators at a Radisson Hotel in Lansing in February, Cline said. He told me, as a warning that youre going to be in for a very bad day. He had seen Todd and Cindy stay in their legislative offices until late at night. He had also seen Cindy leave Todds hotel room at 2 a.m., Cline said. Cindy arrived late that day looking disheveled. ... And (Courser) spent most of the time leaning on cabinets in Rep. Gamrats office. He was distraught, despondent, very quiet. They spent a lot of time in their back office that day. Cline resigned in April. It was not an easy task to chose integrity over a paycheck. But I chose to preserve my integrity and resign effective immediately, Cline said. Having chosen integrity over continued employment in a hostile, untenable work environment in which I was required to turn a blind eye to unethical behavior in the offices of Courser and Gamrat, I am confident I did the right thing. Gamrat spokesman Justin Near declined comment on Clines press conference. Courser did not return calls for comment by the Free Press, and refused to discuss the affair in any detail with reporters on Tuesday.",0,8,5
1252,"William Robocop Melendez, 46, turned himself in Tuesday and was arraigned on four felony charges in connection with a videotaped beating of a black suspect. (Photo via Michigan State Police) » Get Patchs daily newsletter and real-time news alerts. A day after a Detroit cop was arraigned on felony charges stemming from a violent beating of a black suspect that was caught on video and sparked nationwide outrage, the chief of the embattled Inkster Police Department stepped down. On Wednesday, Inkster Police Chief Vicki Yost resigned, saying she and the city were not on the same page after the arrest of William L. Melendez, 46, of Novi, was met with renewed calls by civil rights and other groups to clean up the Inkster Police Department. A brief statement from the city confirmed Yosts resignation, and wished her the best in future endeavors, The Detroit News reports. Wayne County Kym Worthy said Monday her office wasnt aware of the allegations against Melendez until the video, which allegedly shows the officer kicking and punching 57-year-old autoworker Floyd Dent during a routine traffic stop last January, surfaced in March during Dents felony drug trial. The call for police reform in metro Detroit mirror conversations taking place on a national stage. When she announced the charges Monday, Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy said recent allegations of police brutality seem out of control, both locally and nationally. President Obama has said a spate of allegations of police brutality across the country draw attention to the simmering distrust that exists between too many police departments and too many communities of color. Get Tough on Bad Cops Prosecutors have an obligation to go after bad cops, Worthy said Monday. We cannot turn our heads when law enforcement becomes the lawbreaker, she said. Melendez was charged with misconduct in office and mistreatment of a prisoner, both five-year felonies, and two counts of assault with intent to do great bodily harm, 10-year felonies. He was arraigned Tuesday in Inksters 22nd District Court after turning himself into Michigan State Police. Dent, a free man after the charges against him were formally dismissed Tuesday, is savoring what he sees as a step toward justice, but he would like to question Melendez about the beating that sent him to the hospital for three days. Id like to ask him, whyd he beat me like that? I mean, he had no reason to do it, Dent told the Detroit Free Press. So now that hes behind bars and everything, he should feel the pain I felt.  Melendez spent only a brief time behind bars and has been released on bond. David Lee, the beleaguered cops attorney, told the Free Press that he hopes people will keep an open mind about Melendez, who Lee said has been vilified in the media, but has an army of support. Melendez was fired by the Inkster City Council, and authorities in Highland Park, where he moonlighted part time, followed suit. We Found Out He Was Robocop  This weeks developments were about a year in coming for Crystal Linton, an activist with the Rev. Al Sharptons National Action Network who has been trying to get Melendezs badge for about a year. Three complaints raising issues of racial profiling and police brutality surfaced long before the release of a damning video on which Melendezs future as a police officer may eventually hinge. That prompted us to look into his background, Linton told The Detroit News, and we found out he was Robocop. Related: Robocop – a moniker given in a bow to Melendezs muscled physique – is one of the metro Detroit areas most notorious cops. During his time on the Detroit Police Department, he cost the city more than $1 million to settle a lawsuit in the death of an unarmed man shot 11 times; was the subject of more citizen complaints than any other officer in the city: and was among 17 who were indicted, but later acquitted, in an eight-count federal corruption indictment. In all, he was named in a dozen lawsuits alleging excessive force and questioning his fitness as a police officer, including a current civil rights complaint on the U.S. District Court docket that bears some striking similarities to the now-dismissed case against Dent. Why Werent Others Charged? Groups such as the Detroit Coalition Against Police Brutality said the charges against Melendez beg for a thorough house cleaning and reassessment of Inksters hiring practices. We have called for justice in this matter, and we feel that todays charges are a step in the right direction to give Mr. Dent, and the entire community, a proper resolution, the groups spokesman, Ron Scott, said in a statement to The Detroit News. Greg Rohl, one of Dents attorneys, told The Detroit News he was disappointed that only Melendez is being charged. Worthy said Monday her office had concluded its investigation, and no other charges are expected. Its a great day for the legal system, Rohl said Monday, adding that he would like to see others ... held accountable for their actions. Others stood by and did nothing or were complacent in trying to (frame Dent). Watch the video of Dents arrest below.",1,0,0
1253,"More than 40 percent of Dearborn residents are Arab Americans, and the majority of them are Muslim. As global anxiety over Islamic terrorism increases, some Dearborn residents say they dont feel safe in their hometown. (Photo by The Bs/Flickr) _____________________ This story has been updated: The FBI said Friday that an alleged attack on an Arab American man who was speaking Arabic to his children in a Dearborn grocery store earlier this month was not a hate crime. Although abusive language may have been exchanged as the altercation progressed, we have no credible statements or evidence, including the limited video available, to substantiate the claim that the altercation occurred due to the religion, race or ethnicity of any of the combatants, Dearborn police said in a statement. The Dearborn Police Department is continuing its investigation, but said witness statements offer conflicting accounts of the alleged altercation. Some of the witnesses have been active on social media, and have given reports which contradict the version of events as described by all combatants, authorities said. This type of situation could have been totally avoided had cooler heads prevailed, Dearborn Police Chief Ronald Haddad said. This was an isolated incident that is uncommon at the store in question.. Our earlier report: Federal authorities are weighing whether to file hate charges against two Warren men who allegedly assaulted a man who was speaking Arabic at a grocery store in Dearborn, which has the highest concentration of Arab Americans in the United States. That seemed to have been the trigger, Mayor John OReilly Jr. said of the Feb. 12 attack on the Arab American man at the Kroger store in Dearborn on Feb. 12, the Detroit Free Press reports. The man, who wasnt named, was speaking Arabic with his children and they took umbrage at that, OReilly said. More than 40 percent of Dearborn residents are Arab American, and the majority of them are Muslims. The alleged assault raised concerns among Arab Americans about their safety during a time of increased global anxiety over Islamic terrorism, and, closer to home, the shooting deaths of three Arab-American Muslim students in North Carolina on Feb. 10. I hear ISIS, I hear terrorist, I hear go back to your country and raghead,  Kathy Bazzi, 60, of Dearborn told the Free Press last week. A lifelong Dearborn resident who converted to Islam and wears a hijab, the traditional Islamic headscarf worn by many Muslim women, Bazzi witnessed the encounter between the man and two white men. The alleged attack occurred when one of the men taunted the Arab American mans daughter for wearing a hijab, and made disparaging remarks about Muslims and ISIS, the acronym for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. Then, all of a sudden, the man is punching this Arabic man, fists started flying, Bazzi said. She said the two white men threw the first punches, but appeared to take the brunt of the attack. None of the three was seriously injured, OReilly said. Mayor: Impossible Not to Have an Emotional Reaction OReilly said there is no evidence that the men who allegedly attacked the man are part of a larger group targeting local Muslims. This was a spur of the moment event, OReilly said. The alleged perpetrators are not part of any organization. Theres no evidence that they came to Dearborn with any intent. Local tensions are symptomatic of growing fear nationally about the threat posed by ISIS. A Gallup poll published last week found that 84 percent of Americans view terrorism as the gravest threat to U.S. security. Its impossible not to have an emotional reaction to...ISIS, OReilly said. Its concerning to everybody – including everyone in our community – this total disregard for life and for the rights of people, were seeing on TV. Its an emotional time. Bazzi said the tension locally is getting worse every day. I dont like to travel outside my comfort zone. When I leave my house, Im starting to look over my shoulder when I go places, she said. Its a terrible feeling. I just dont feel secure, even in my own city. I grew up in Dearborn and lived here my whole life. FBI: Hate Crimes Against Muslims Underreported The FBI said 160 American Muslims were victimized in hate crimes each year between 2011 and 2013, but qualified the number as significantly underreported, The Washington Post said. A Pew Research Center poll in 2011 found that 6 percent of American Muslims said they had been threatened or attacked. There were about 2.6 million American Muslims at the time, and the poll results suggest that 156,000 of them may have been victims of hate crimes. The Department of Justice said in 2013 that two of every three hate crimes are not reported, especially among American Muslims, who have been targeted in local and federal police investigations simply because of their religion in the 14 years since the 9/11 terrorist attacks. That excessive scrutiny has eroded the trust necessary for victims to report hate crimes, The Post said. The Charlie Hedbo attack in Paris has caused a spike in anti-Muslim hate rhetoric, Ibrahim Hooper, communications director at the Council on American-Islamic Relations, told Mashable. Since the attacks on the satirical magazine last month, Hooper said he has fielded and turned over to the FBI dozens and dozens of hate emails and calls and even threats. We see this being replicated all over the country as what has been termed Islamophobia takes root, he said. Mark Potok, a senior fellow at the Southern Poverty Law Center, a group that monitors hate crimes in the United States, told Mashable the actual number of hate crimes may be as much as 40 percent higher than the number reported to the FBI. Anecdotally, I dont have the slightest doubt that anti-Muslim crime and hate speech is very much on the rise, Potok said. That is a function of radical Islam being on the news recently. In addition to the Chapel Hill murders, other high profile attacks against American Muslims include one in Kansas City in December when a Somali Christian ran over and killed a 15-year-old Muslim boy; anti-Muslim graffiti sprayed on a school in Washington, DC; and a plot to blow up an Islamic center in Austin, TX. Hooper thinks hate crimes against American Muslims will continue to increase in 2015. Sometimes youll see more hate incidents, sometimes youll see more things like workplace discrimination, he said. It depends on the year. ISIS Recruiting in U.S. and Globally Osama Siblani, publisher of The Arab American News in Dearborn, told WJBK-TV hes seen an uptick in threats against American Muslims as ISIS steps up recruitment efforts in the United States and globally. We have people in this country ready to go and fight with ISIS. And we have people in this country who are crazy and want to kill Muslims, he said. They are putting it on Facebook and Twitter, Siblani said.Like lets burn Dearborn down because it has Muslims and Arabs, lets start by burning Dearborn down to the ground.  Earlier this week, the FBI detained Iraqi Al-Hamzah Mohammad Jawad, 29, of East Lansing as he tried to fly out of the Detroit Metropolitan Airport in Romulus to join ISIS in Iraq. » Are you getting the free daily Patch newsletter and news alerts?

1254,"Fatalities in police chases are higher in Michigan than theyve been in more than a decade, according to an analysis by The Saginaw Index/MLive.com. In 2014, 27 people died in 23 fatal police chases, an increase from 16 deaths in 14 fatal chases the year prior. The number of injuries – 207 and 203 in 2014 and 2013, respectively – did not substantially change. Fatal police pursuits occurred last year in Allegan, Berrien, Genesee, Ingham, Isabella, Macomb, Oakland and Wayne counties. The report doesnt show how many police chases occur in Michigan a year, because the Michigan State Police only tracks those involving crashes. The MLive analysis showed that though fewer crashes are recorded, theyre increasingly deadly. MSP First Lt. David Simon said that when people fail to stop for police, theres usually a serious underlying reason. Tell Us: You hate to let somebody like that go, he said. Chris Collis, a Southfield attorney representing the family of Jacqueline Nichols, a passenger in a car broadsided by a Michigan State Police cruiser in July 2014, thinks police are too aggressive in giving chase. There are circumstances where chases can be appropriate or necessary, Collis said. In our instance, I dont believe thats the case. ... The simple fact is that it began with a seat belt violation and ended up in the tragic death of their mother, theres not much else to say about that. This case was nothing but a tragedy that couldve been avoided. Police say the decision to give chase is a judgment call made in a split-second, with consequences either way. Its never a perfect scenario, Saginaw County Sheriff William Federspiel said, adding that pursuits, while extremely dangerous, are at times necessary. » Read the full analysis here.",0,8,5
1255,"As the Oakland County officials do damage control over media coverage of a viral video of an encounter between a deputy and a Pontiac man that many have criticized as an abuse of power and an example of racial profiling, satirist Stephen Colbert has entered the brouhaha. Colbert suggested on his Comedy Central program, The Colbert Report, Monday night that things would be a lot calmer if black people just agreed never to put their hands up, or in their pockets. Colberts spin on the video, which already had already been shared tens of thousands of times by the time the program aired, is the latest example of media coverage that is causing huge headaches for Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard and his staff. The Thanksgiving encounter between the Pontiac man, Brandon McKean, and a sheriffs deputy touched already frayed nerves as the racial divide deepened and protests continued in Ferguson, MO, after a grand jury declined to indict white police officer who fatally shot Michael Brown, 18, in August. On Monday, Bouchard acknowledged there are bad cops and they should be dealt with swiftly. In the past two years, he said, his department has arrested, charged and fired employees who acted improperly. But were also responsible for standing up for people who do something right, Bouchard said, according to The Detroit News. And in this case, the deputy did everything right. Certainly, we dont want police officers jumping to conclusions about peoples race, religion, sex or whatever, he said We want them to react based on the circumstances. But it seems more and more, police are being stereotyped as being mean or racists when, in fact, most of the women and men I know who put on the uniform do it because they want to help people. Related: Bouchard said the quick spread of the video has resulted hang-up calls coming in from across the country, some with messages like, Ive got my hands in my pockets, (expletive) you, the Detroit Free Press reports. But the actual 911 audio tape of the call indicates the business owner who made it was in imminent fear that he would be harmed or robbed, something that had happened multiple times before. Part of the transcript from the call follows: I need just to inform you theres a light skinned guy that passes by five, six times, back and forth, back and forth looking at us, looking inside and he keeps passing by and he sees a lot of people in here, said the caller, whose identity and business were redacted from the audio file obtained by The Detroit News through the Freedom of Information Act. He looks suspicious ... and he ... just passed by again. The dispatcher asked the caller if he was in immediate danger and he responded: No, I mean, Im assuming yes, he keeps going back and forth and looking at us. I mean Im assuming hes going to do something, so thats why Im trying to notify you guys. Bouchard said that given the tenor of the 911 call, the deputys response was appropriate and even restrained. The business and the employees have been robbed seven times. (The 911 caller) sees this guy walk by five or six times, and he thinks hes going to be robbed at any minute, Bouchard said. From my point of view, the deputy was very restrained, given that he was potentially approaching an armed robber. There are only two outcomes here: Either police respond to 911 calls, or they dont, the sheriff said Both McKean, the African-American man who was questioned, and the deputy, who has not been identified, used their cell phones to record the incident. The deputys unedited video includes a longer exchange in which McKean agrees deputies should have been dispatched to the situation. ____ Screenshot and video via The Colbert Report",0,8,5
1256,"Do you think the Catholic Church is doing enough about the sexual abuse scandal? Go to the comments and tell us what you think. (Photo via Shutterstock) ______________ Already on probation for child molestation, a Jesuit priest was charged in U.S. District Court Monday with child pornography offenses for allegedly videotaping hockey players in a changing room 15 years ago at the University of Detroit Jesuit High School, where he was a chemistry teacher. Richard James Kurtz, 69, was charged with producing, possessing and transporting child pornography, the Detroit Free Press, WXYZ-TV, WWJ/CBS and other metro Detroit media report. Kurtz allegedly made the videotapes during the 1998-99 hockey season. Combined, the charges are punishable by up to 60 years in prison. In 2012, Kurtz admitted in a plea deal that he molested a U-D Jesuit student to the Air Force Academy in Colorado in 2001. The school fired him after learning of the students allegations and reported him to Child Protection Services, but he wasnt charged until a decade later. At the time he was fired from the school, where he had taught chemistry off and on for 25 years, he was also stripped of the right to perform public ministry, the Chicago-Detroit Province of the Society of Jesuits said in a statement. Tell Us: Though Kurtz didnt get prison time, he is serving a 10-year-to-life term of supervised probation in confinement in Missouri, where he was arrested Monday on the new charges. He is awaiting extradition to Detroit. The new charges stem from evidence turned over to the FBI by two Jesuit priests in Chicago, where Kurtz was living at the time of his 2011 arrest. They found evidence, both in Chicago and Kurtzs Michigan home in Clarkston, linking him to the hockey team locker room. A member of SNAP – Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests – said the allegations against Kurtz are devious and sickening, and could open old wounds among members of the 1989-99 hockey team. I can only imagine what theyre feeling, Matt Jatczak told the Free Press. Theyre probably angry and shocked and upset. And hopefully theyre not scarred by what this man has done. You might also like: The Chicago-based online support network is asking anyone with information about Kurtz that might be helpful to federal investigators to come forward. Oftentimes victim and witnesses and whistleblowers assume that when a sex offender is charged, its a done deal, SNAP director David Clohessy, who disclosed in 1990 he had been abused by a priest, told the Free Press. But in our experience, weve seen time and time again sex offender clerics hire top notch lawyers ... and get off completely, he said. An Archdiocese of Detroit spokesman said though the allegations against Kurtz are very troubling, Kurtz worked directly for the Jesuit religious order, which runs the school, and was not our priest. The Chicago-Detroit Province of the Society of Jesuits issued a statement saying it has cooperated fully with the investigation and remains committed to justice and healing for those involved. The U.S. Attorneys Office said Kurtz taught chemistry at U-D Jesuit from 1970-73, 1978-83 and September 1984-May 2001.",0,8,5

(Photo: Pennsylvania State University) ___________________ Police in a rural Michigan county think they have the man responsible for a spate of armed robberies of Amish buggies in in custody. The buggy robberies date back to May in Gladwin and Clare counties, where deputies were joined by troopers from Michigan State Police in tracking down the suspect. Last week, Doyle Robert Dell, 20, of Gladwin was arrested after authorities served a search warrant at his home and found evidence tying him to the robberies, MLive/The Saginaw News reports. Police have released few details about the robberies, including what was stolen or how many attacks there have been. WJRT-TV reported the robberies normally occurred at night, and the suspect, later identified as Dell, used the bright lights of his vehicle so his victims would be unable to identify him. Michigan State Police Det. Pete McNamara told UpLiveNorth.com that crimes against the peace-loig Amish sects are rare. There arent many reported crimes from the Amish community, he said in July after police appealed to the public for help in identifying the suspect. Theyre very quiet people that tend to stay to themselves, and (it) is unusual that someone had victimized them in a crime such as these. Police allege Dell demanded cash after stopping the buggies. These are very serious crimes, McNamara said in July. The fact that theyre stopping a buggy and demanding something from them – its a very serious crime. We dont take that very likely. Amish sects have lived in Michigan since the late 1800s, but didnt settle in large numbers in Clare and Gladwin counties until the mid-1980s. There are currently 251,000 Amish living in 456 settlements the United States and Ontario, Canada, including 10,200 Amish living in the Great Lakes state, according to the 2010 Religion Census. Researchers from Ohio State University found that a new Amish community is formed every three and half-weeks and that more than 60 percent of Amish settlements have been founded since 1990.

Physically, the 54-year-old tree trimmer from Clinton Township is recovering, but mentally, he has a ways to go, Mandi Marie Emerick told The Detroit News after one of the suspects, Latrez Cummings, made bail Thursday. Utash, who suffered severe head trauma when a mob attacked him after he stopped to give aid to a 10-year-old boy he had accidentally hit in traffic, was recently transferred to the Rehabilitation Institute of Michigan, a facility at the Detroit Medical Center that specializes in neurological damage and memory injuries. Emerick was upset that Cummings, 19, was released after he made a lowered $25,000 bond. He will wear a GPS tracking device as a condition of his release, but Emerick said it kind of freaks me out that he will be free while her father struggles to regain his memory. She found out about Cummings release from jail when police called her to get her correct address. Thats one of the places he is restricted from visiting. Three other adults and a juvenile – who police call the instigator and the only one of the five charged with a hate crime – have been arrested and charged with assault with intent to commit murder. The other three adults are: Bruce Wimbush Jr., 17, whose bond was lowered from $500,000 to $100,000 James Davis, 24, whose bond was also lowered from $500,000 to $100,000 Wonzey Saffold, 30, whose bond hearing was continued August trial dates have been set for the four adults charged in the vicious attack. The 16-year-old, whose name is not being used by Patch, is charged with assault and ethnic intimidation and will be tried June 23 in juvenile court. He reportedly admitted that he attacked Utash because he is white and the 10-year-old he accidentally struck with his vehicle was black. All five suspects are also black. The juveniles trial is scheduled for June 23. The Utash family is raising money to defray the medical bills being incurred by their father, who has no health-care insurance, on the online fundraising site Go Fund Me, where donations currently stand at $186,758.",0,8,5
1263,"A witness to the vicious attack on Steven Utash, the 54-year-old Clinton Township tree trimmer who was beaten when he stopped to assist a boy he accidentally struck with his truck, was jailed on $500,000 bond Monday after he reportedly denied earlier statements hed made to police about the mob violence. Anton Sykes, 30, was ordered to jail during a hearing Monday for four Detroit men who are accused in the attack, the Detroit Free Press reports. In ordering him to jail, 36th District Judge Thomas Jackson said the witness was defiant and likely would  disappear before the trial of the four defendants. The proceeding was often disruptive, with one of the defendants reportedly making an obscene gesture at a photographer. Spectators laughed at times during the proceeding and one man was escorted from the courtroom, The Detroit News reports. The defendants are Wonzey Saffold, 30;  Latrez Cummings, 19; James Davis, 24, and Bruce Edward Wimbush Jr., 17. All four face charges of assault with intent to murder and were bound over for trial in Mondays proceedings. Wimbush, who will be tried as an adult, waived his right to a hearing and will apparently be tried separately from Cummings, Saffold and Davis, CBS News reports. A juvenile, who has been charged with a hate crime under Michigans ethnic intimidation statute, will be tried on June 23 before Judge Jerome Cavanagh. His attorney argued last week that his client acted on the spur of the moment, and the ethnic intimidation statute was not appropriate. Several witnesses testified they saw 15 to 20 men kicking Utash when he got out of his truck at the intersection of Morang and Balfour on Detroits east side the afternoon of April 2. Witness Ashley Daniels testified that she told Utash he should get back in his truck after one of the assailants hit him in the face. Daniels said he was hit multiple times in the face, and then was taken to the ground by the group of men, who then began kicking him. Cummings brandished a handgun and pointed it at Utash before joining in the attack, Daniels said. Deborah Hughes, the retired nurse who is credited with saving Utashs life by convincing the mob to back away, testified that she heard  Cummings yell, Im going to kill him! She said that Utash appeared very upset after his pickup struck the boy. He said, Oh my God, I hit a boy! Is he dead? Is he dead ... did I hurt him?  During the attack, Utash yelled No! and Help me! as he was hit and kicked in the head, Hughes said. Utash remains in the intensive care unit at a Detroit hospital. In an update on the Go Fund Me site, where more than  $180,900 has been raised to offset uninsured Utashs medical bills, his daughter Mandi Marie Emerick posted an update about her fathers slow recovery. I have been putting off posting an update hoping that after the next visit I would have some better news, she wrote. But days are going by and I dont have better news to share. He is still unable to distinguish reality from his delusions. It is hard to explain in words what he is talking about. And (its) very sad for us to see him this way.

1264,"The lawyer for a teenager alleged to have been the instigator in the vicious beating of a 54-year-old Clinton Township tree trimmer two weeks ago said his client reacted on the spur of the moment and should not be charged with a hate crime. The 16-year-old, who has not been named, was charged with ethnic intimidation as a minor and assault with intent to do great bodily harm in the April 2 mob beating of Steven Utash, who had stopped to assist a child he struck with his truck on Detroits east side. The teenager appeared in Wayne County Juvenile Court Thursday, where he waived his pretrial hearing, The Detroit News reports. His jury trial is scheduled for June 23 before Judge Jerome Cavanagh. The term hate crime is not necessarily, in my mind, what happened in this incident, the teens lawyer, Solomon Radner of Southfield, told The Detroit News after the hearing. I think of a hate crime as burning a cross on someones lawn, lynching someone because of their color or painting a swastika on a synagogue, he said. Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy said earlier that the state has the evidence to convict the youngest of five offenders charged so far in the beating with a hate crime. He reportedly told investigators that he started to attack Utash because he was white and the 10-year-old boy struck by his truck was black. The four adults charged with assault with intent to commit murder and assault with intent to do great bodily harm are scheduled to appear Monday in Wayne County Circuit Court for their preliminary examinations. None of the adults has been charged under Michigans ethnic intimidation statute. In Thursdays proceeding, Cavanagh denied Radners request to lower the teenagers $400,000 bond, and sided with Wayne County Assistant Prosecutor Hervey Jenkins, who said of the crime, This is about as serious as you can get. The prosecutor also cited the teens previous record and said he tested positive for marijuana use when he was arrested. Utash sustained severe head trauma in the attack and remains in and out of consciousness at a Detroit hospital, where he is beginning and long and expensive journey to rehabilitation. His family said he has taken a few steps with a walker An online fundraiser on the Go Fund Me site had raised more than $179,675 in the 14 days since it was established by Utashs family to offset his medical expenses.

1265,"Race played a role in the April 2 attack on Steven Utash, the Clinton Township man who was severely beaten by an angry mob when he stopped to assist a boy he accidentally hit with his pickup, Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy said Thursday. One of five individuals charged in the brutal beating, a minor whose name was not released by authorities, has been charged under Michigans ethnic intimidation statute. He also has been charged with assault with intent to do great bodily harm, the Detroit Free Press reports. Utash, who is white, was beat by a group of 12 black men. Though the juvenile was charged under Michigans ethnic intimidation, Worthy said charges against four adults do not meet the criteria for an ethnic intimidation charge, the prosecutor said. As in all cases with multiple defendants we must evaluate each persons actions individually to assess their alleged criminal conduct, Worthy told the Free Press. In the case of the 16-year-old charged as a juvenile, we can prove beyond a reasonable doubt the crimes of assault with intent to do great bodily harm and ethnic intimidation. Detroit police initially said there was no evidence to support the attack was racially motivated, but this week opened the door to include the possibility that it was a hate crime. The issue of race is being looked at as a possible motive, Detroit Police Chief James Craig said. A fifth suspect, Latrez Cummings, 19, was arrested Wednesday and charged with assault with intent to murder and assault with intent to do great bodily harm in the attack. Three others face the same charges: Bruce Edward Wimbush Jr., 17; Wonzey Saffold, 30; and James Deontae Davis, 24. Utash remains in a medically induced coma but is healing, members of his family said. He doesnt have medical insurance and could remain in the hospital for up to six months.

Charges wont be pressed in the case of an Arab-American Muslim man who said he was racially assaulted after he spoke Arabic with his children at a Dearborn Kroger grocery store last February, apparently angering another customer to the point of a physical confrontation. Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy said Friday there is insufficient evidence to prosecute the two brothers – one of them a 46-year-old from Dearborn and the other a 44-year-old from Kentucky – who allegedly taunted the mans daughter for wearing a hijab. The two men had also reportedly asked for charges in the incident. After months of investigation and follow-up work, we simply do not have sufficient, credible and admissible information to be able to proceed on either the complaint or cross complaint, Worthy said, according to a report in the Detroit Free Press. We spent considerable time and resources trying to get to the truth in this case so that a charging decision could be made using the appropriate legal standards. Related: The alleged assault raised concerns among Arab Americans about their safety during a time of increased global anxiety over Islamic terrorism, and, closer to home, the shooting deaths of three Arab-American Muslim students in North Carolina on Feb. 10. About 40 percent of Dearborn residents are Arab American, and many of them are Muslims. In February, the FBI said the altercation didnt rise to the level of a hate crime. Kathy McMillan Bazzi, 60, told the Free Press in February that she witnessed the altercation. I hear ISIS, I hear terrorist, I hear go back to your country and raghead, Bazzi said.

1268,"The youngest of five people arrested so far and the only suspect charged with a hate crime in the vicious attack on 54-year-old Steve Utash earlier this month was the first to throw punches and was reportedly the instigator. Assistant Wayne County Attorney Matthew Penney made the allegations during a court hearing Saturday at the Wayne County Juvenile Detention Center in Detroit, where the 16-year-old is being held, the Detroit Free Press reports. Penney argued that the suspect, who is from Detroit, poses a danger to society. Utash had stopped to assist a 10-year-old boy he had accidentally struck with his pickup truck after the youth darted into traffic, when the suspect led the savage beating of a completely innocent man, Penney said. Juvenile Court Referee Raeijen Woods noted the severity of the crime and set bail at $400,000 – $100,000 less than Penney had requested. The juveniles defense attorney, Sterling Coleman, pointed out that his client does not have a juvenile record and both of his parents are involved in his life. They attended Saturdays hearing. His mother said he is an average teenager who is considered a good kid by other parents in his neighborhood. This is not my child you are describing, she said. The suspect is charged with ethnic intimidation by a minor and assault with intent to do great bodily harm. The suspect is being charged as a juvenile and his name has not been released. Four adults have also been charged with one count each of assault with intent to commit murder and assault with intent to do great bodily harm. None of the adults has been charged with a hate crime. Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy said in a statement that her office can prove beyond a reasonable doubt the crimes of assault with intent to do great bodily harm and ethnic intimidation. More people may be charged as the investigation continues, she said. Utash awoke from his medically induced coma Friday, according to a post from one of his daughters on the Go Fund Me online site, where more than $175,000 has been raised to help pay for Utashs medical bills.

Joe Utash told the newspaper that it looked as if someone had taken a hammer to his fathers head. There are lumps all over his head, everywhere you look. Steve Utash was beaten unconscious when he was mobbed by a large group of people after he stopped to give aid to a child he accidentally hit on his way home from work as a tree trimmer.

When the family members of the tree trimmer, who has no health insurance, set up the campaign, they hoped to meet a $50,000 Utash, who recently moved to Clinton Township from Roseville, remains in critical condition in a medically induced coma in a Detroit hospital. Wayne County Attorney Kym Worthy said Monday Bruce Edward Wimbush Jr., one of the two teens arrested Saturday in the mob attack on the 54-year-old Utash, faces charges of assault with intent to murder and assault with intent to do great bodily harm, the Detroit Free Press reports. He is expected to be arraigned in 36th District Court on Tuesday. A 16-year-old who was arrested at the same time is in the custody of juvenile authorities and has not yet been charged. Late Monday afternoon, two more people – both men, ages 24 and 30 – were arrested in the crime that has generated outrage across the country. Detroit  police Sgt. Michael Woody told the Free Press that authorities arent ruling out the possibility of charging the suspects under hate-crime statutes. The assault-with-intent-to-commit murder charge against Wimbush is punishable by up to life in prison. The bodily harm charge is a 10-year felony. Authorities believe the four who have been arrested so far were part of a larger group that attacked Utash after he stopped to give aid to David Harris, after he accidentally hit him.

They also struggled to understand what caused the brutal attack. Why are we so angry? the Rev. Larry Simmons, pastor of the Baber Memorial A.M.E. Church on Detroits West Side, asked in his sermon. Whats wrong with us? At Greater St. Matthew Baptist Church in Highland Park, the Rev. David Alexander cited a parable from John 9 in which Jesus talks about why a blind man is blind, and said its up to the faith community to engage the spiritually blind mob of young men who dont see clearly, who flew into a rage. Theyre spiritually blind, he said. Alexander said his church will donate $1,000 to help offset Utashs medical bills, telling congregants this is an opportunity for us to do Gods work. The Rev.

Clinton Township police responded to Tin Fish in The Mall at Partridge Creek shortly after 12:30 a.m. Feb. 20 for a possible case of domestic violence in which the woman was reported to be the victim. Upon arrival, Partridge Creek security told police the woman had taken off around the building shortly after the 911 call was placed and Medstar personnel were currently attempting to talk with her and determine if any sort of treatment was necessary. The woman, who was facing a wall and screaming obscenities at Medstar personnel, appeared disheveled and her words were heavily slurred, according to police. She was asked multiple times if she needed help or wanted to get into the ambulance to warm up but continued to swear at those around her. When the officer approached her, she began shouting racial slurs and attempted to swing at a nearby medic as well as kick the officer, according to the police report. The woman was restrained in handcuffs and placed in the waiting ambulance where she appeared to calm down. However, when the officer asked again if she was injured, she became violent and pulled out of the cuffs, police say. Refusing help as well as a taxi, the woman swung once more at Medstar personnel and again attempted to kick the officer. She was placed in custody for resisting and obstructing arrest and assault and battery on a police officer, according to the report. Once confined to a scout car, the woman began to kick at the windows of the vehicle and later refused to cooperate with booking procedures at the station.

The suspect, who was identified through surveillance video in the area, is awaiting arraignment. His name has not been released. Similar crimes were reported in Inkster, police said. Those arrested include murder suspect Kayla Thomas, 21, of Taylor, who is accused of shooting a motorist who then crashed into several parked vehicles in the area of Madison and Bennett around 10 p.m. on Sunday, Oct. 16. The victim, Raymond Mshahwar, 33, of Canton, was pronounced dead at a local hospital.  Two alleged accomplices, Walbert Morales-Castro, 18, of Detroit, and a 16-year-old female from Dearborn, were arrested on Dec. 13. They are awaiting trial in 3rd Circuit Court. Thomas, who was arrested on Jan. 27, is charged with homicide-felony murder, conspiracy to commit armed robbery, and armed robbery. She is being held in the Wayne County Jail without bond, and is due back on court Friday. They had to be buzzed into the store, and once inside smashed several display cases, pistol-whipped the store owner, store numerous jewelry items and fled the store in an older model red Chevrolet Cavalier convertible, police said. After surveillance footage was distributed to the media and area police, a police officer in a nearby jurisdiction was able to develop information that was provided to Dearborn detectives. This information was a crucial turning point in the investigation, Haddad said in a statement. The three were later arrested at their residences, and the getaway car and numerous pieces of evidence were seized when a search warrant was executed. On Jan.23, the Wayne County Prosecutors Office filed charges of armed robbery, assault to do great bodily harm less than murder, felony firearm and assault against all three men.

1276,"Detroit, MI — Authorities on Sunday accused four Detroit residents of making social media threats to kill white police officers, but formal charges could hinge on the interpretation of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on what constitutes a true threat. The court held in a 2015 ruling that true threats are not protected speech, but how the exception applies in different circumstances is uncharted legal territory. Some legal scholars say it applies in only a small range of cases, and whether its applicable in the arrests announced by Detroit Police Chief James Craig Sunday is debatable. Having a bad thought isnt necessarily a crime, Larry Durbin, a law professor at Detroit Mercy School of Law, told The Detroit News. NEWSLETTER & REAL-TIME NEWS ALERTS: Get the Top Michigan Headlines from Patch Editor Beth Dalbey Craig said the hostile environment police officers work in today should raise threats against their lives to the same level as threats against the president, which would result in arrests and prosecution. How is it any different when someone threatens to kill white cops? he said. Social media is new territory, and while its been established that hate speech is protected by the First Amendment, were talking about people specifically saying on Facebook they want to kill white police officers, Craig told The Detroit News. Craig announced the four people had been arrested Sunday after their alleged threats were discovered by the counter-terrorism unit of the Detroit Police Department. Detroit police, along with law enforcement agencies across the country, have been on heightened alert after long simmering tensions between black civilians and white police officers boiled over with two officer-involved shootings of African-Americans Alton Sterling in Louisiana and Philando Castile in Minnesota, culminating with the sniper attack at the Black Lives Rally protest in Dallas. The various posts all directed threats toward police, Craig said. One of the suspects is accused of recruiting people to wage war and shoot the police first. Another posted videos and pictures of police shootings and allegedly wrote, this needs to happen more, and a third allegedly wrote: All lives cant matter until black lives matter. Kill all white cops. A fourth suspect allegedly professed admiration for Micah Xavier Johnson, the accused sniper. On Facebook, he allegedly called Johnson a hero and said he inspired me to do the exact same thing. Similar threats have been made across the country. A Louisiana man is accused of showing a handgun in a Facebook video recorded of a police car in front of his vehicle in a drive-through lane. He reportedly said on the video that he wanted to kill the police officer, according to a report in the Shreveport Times. Elsewhere, a Wisconsin man allegedly called on social media for black men to kill white police officers, and an Illinois woman threatened in an online video to shoot and kill any police officer who pulled her over, the Associated Press reports. Its unclear what charges the four Detroiters may face, but Craig said he plans to consult with federal, state and local prosecutors. I know this is a new issue, but I want these people charged with crimes, Craig said.

1277,"The family of Janet Wilson, 31, who was shot multiple times and killed by a Dearborn police officer a week ago, called for justice at a news conference Wednesday. Wilson was shot by a Dearborn officer police on Hubbard Drive after an incident with mall security officers at nearby Fairlane Town Center on Jan. 27. I dont want you to turn a blind eye to this, her niece Cassie Bass said, according to a report by WWJ. This cannot happen, this cannot keep going on. Injustice for one, injustice for all. Who is policing the police? They gunned my auntie down. She didnt have a weapon.  Authorities with the Michigan State Police are investigating the late afternoon shooting, the second Dearborn police-involved shooting of an unarmed suspect in about a month. Last week, State Police First Lt. Michael Shaw said Wilson appears to have deliberately tried to hit a security guard with her Chevy HHR outside the Fairlane Town Center Mall. Dearborn police were called, and after Wilson was briefly stopped in heavy traffic, she started to speed away, almost striking an officer. Thats when the officer opened fire. Bass and other members of Wilsons family disputed the police account of what happened and questioned the use of deadly force, according to a report in the Detroit Free Press. This is a murder, Bass said. If I was a murderer, I would be behind bars, underneath the jail. Bass said her aunt, who family members described as mentally challenged but able to work and keep a car and a home, was no confrontational person. She was loving; she was goofy; she was funny. She took care of herself. ... She was functional, just like you and me, Bass said. Minister and Detroit activist Malik Shabazz said police could have employed other methods, such as throwing stop sticks on the road or shooting out the vehicles tires, to deter Wilson. Janet Wilson was killed ... worse than a dog, he said. Something unacceptable happened, Shabazz said. The communitys eyes are on this. Civil rights activists have raised questions of racial profiling by Dearborn officers. Kevin Matthews, 35, was shot during a struggle with a Dearborn police officer after he crossed the border from Dearborn to Detroit during a foot chase on Dec. 23. Matthews was wanted on a misdemeanor warrant from Redford Township, and escaped from police custody in a larceny case, police have said. Several rallies have been held in protest. At Wednesdays news conference, Shabazz said policy changes are needed in Dearborn and everywhere. We want to know what happened, Shabazz said. We want justice. Family members have asked witnesses who havent been interviewed by Michigan State Police to step forward. An attorney for the family, Vince Colella, said business surveillance video or cellphone video taken by passersby may contain valuable evidence. If there were shots fired into this vehicle before it started to advance towards this officer ... that would be excessive force, Colella said. In a statement after Wilson was fatally shot, Dearborn Police Chief Ronald Haddad said his department is deeply saddened by the two officer-involved fatal shooting incidents, both are which are under investigation by State Police and other independent agencies. Upon conclusion of the criminal investigations we will be conducting internal reviews on both of these incidents, Haddad said. While we are very proud of our long history of Civil Rights advocacy as well as our history of appropriate use of force, we will closely examine all of our policies and procedures to ensure that we are employing the latest training and following national best practices in all of our responsibilities to the community. The family also said it had created a GoFundMe account to pay for funeral expenses.",1,0,0
1278,"Led by the family of Kevin Matthews, who was fatally shot by a Dearborn police officer last month, and the Rev. Charles Williams II of the National Action Network,  protesters called for justice during a demonstration on Michigan Avenue Monday night. Matthews, 35, of Detroit, was unarmed when he was shot during a struggle after allegedly going for the officers gun on Dec. 23. Stay Connected Waving placards that read We Want Justice for All and We Demand Human Rights, the 150 to 200 protesters demanded change in the hour-long rally and called for an economic boycott of Dearborn businesses. We will not be spending dollars in Dearborn, Williams said, according to a Detroit Free Press report. No justice, no dollars. Related Matthews mother, Valerie Johnson, told reporters she wants to get justice for my son. Outside the Dearborn Police Department on Michigan Avenue, the demonstrators chanted: Hey hey, ho ho, these racist cops have got to go. The rally was peaceful, but tensions ran high when Dearborn police surrounded a small group in the Kroger parking lot and asked them to leave because it was private property. The group dispersed without incident. Matthews, who reportedly had escaped from Dearborn officers earlier on the day he died, was shot after a short foot chase that started in Dearborn and ended in a back yard several blocks away in Detroit. He reportedly had been picked up on suspicion of larceny, and was also wanted on a misdemeanor warrant from Redford Township. Take On Hate and Black Lives Matter also participated in the rally that drew Christian and Muslim religious leaders, labor unions and others. Matthews is black and the officer, who hasnt been named, is white. The officer, a five-year veteran of the police department, has been placed on administrative leave pending the completion of an investigation by the Detroit Police Department. Matthews has been described as a harmless individual who suffers from paranoid-schizophrenia. Dearborn police say he has repeatedly caused problems in the city, but activists say police targeted him. Before the Dec. 23 shooting, officers took him home, rather than to jail, activists said. Marchers said Monday that its imperative that the shooting be thoroughly investigated. I think that we all can agree that when a police officer shoots someone ... it needs to be investigated, Joe McGuire, of Dearborn, told The Detroit News while carrying a handmade cardboard sign that read: Authority without accountability is injustice.",0,8,5
1279,"Protesters with the National Action Network, Take on Hate and Black Lives Matter plan to march and shut down a stretch of Michigan Avenue Monday night to protest the fatal shooting of an unarmed suspect by a Dearborn police officer last month. The march begins at the Kroger parking lot at 6:30 p.m. at Michigan Avenue and Greenfield, and will continue a few blocks to the Dearborn Police Department at 16099 Michigan Ave., organizers told the Detroit Free Press. Kevin Matthews, 35, of Detroit, was shot multiple times on Dec. 23 during a struggle with the police officer, a five-year veteran of the department who is on administrative leave pending the completion of an investigation by the Detroit Police Department. The Rev. Charles Williams, president of the Detroit Action Network, said protesters hope to mimic what happened in Chicago and other cities where protests were held to protest police shootings of unarmed black suspects. Also on Patch Were going to be shutting down Dearborn, Williams said. We have to send a message throughout the nation that it is not OK for young African-American, unarmed men to continue to get shot down by police. ... We will shut business down. This is a move to make sure that we actually send a message throughout this country that police brutality cannot continue. According to police statements, Matthews allegedly went for the officers gun after a short foot chase from Tireman and Greenfield in Dearborn into a nearby Detroit neighborhood. Matthews reportedly had been involved in a larceny in Dearborn, and was wanted on a $2,500 misdemeanor warrant from Redford Township. Detroit Police Chief James Craig said a witness reported a struggle. The officers uniform was torn, and the equipment from his belt was in disarray, according to reports. Dearborn police said Matthews was a chronic problem in the city, according to WXYZ-TV. However, civil rights groups said that Dearborn police aggressively targeted Matthews, who reportedly suffered from paranoid-schizophrenia, but was harmless. On many occasions, officers who dealt with him didnt arrest him, did not take him to jail, Williams said at a news conference. They took him home. We want to know why on so many occasions they did that, but why this time was different? The march will be peaceful, Take On Hate campaign manager and former state Rep. Rashida Tlaib told the Free Press. We feel a sense of responsibility to elevate the voice of this victim, Tlaib said. People are devastated at how he was chased down and shot in a back yard. ... Were going to make sure that Kevin Matthews death was not in vain. ... We want to make sure that we hold them all accountable and it takes us being out there and being public in trying to achieve some sort of reason. According to a report last year by USA TODAY that analyzed arrests in 2011 and 2012, Dearborn police arrest blacks at 26 times the rate of whites. The department arrested 4,500 black people — more than half of all arrests during those years — according to the reports the department submitted to the FBI. Dearborn is predominately white — only 4 percent of residents are black — but Police Chief Ronald Haddad said at the time that its unfair to measure arrest records against the citys demographics. We treat everyone the same, he said. » Kevin Matthews photo courtesy of Karen Matthews",1,0,0

In what authorities are calling one of the most successful sex trafficking stings in the country, 19 children were rescued and 12 suspected pimps were arrested in a sting that swept through Metro Detroit. The national collaboration between the FBI, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, state and local law enforcement, known as Operation Cross Country IX, targeted criminal enterprises responsible for the commercial sex trafficking of children, according to a news release. Participating agencies included the Wayne County Prosecutors Office, Michigan State Police, the Michigan Attorney Generals Office and the U.S. Attorneys Office and local police departments. Our office is pleased with the success of the operation in metro Detroit, but we, along with all of our law enforcement partners, do not stop here, FBI Detroit Division Special Agent in Charge David P. Gelios said. This is all part of an ongoing effort to continue to free victims of human trafficking, and arrest the individuals that commit these crimes. Local police departments in Detroit, Dearborn, Livonia, Roseville and Romulus assisted, as did sheriffs offices in Wayne, Macomb, Washtenaw, Kent and Ottawa counties. A companion federal sex trafficking sting is ongoing as part of Operation Cross Country, now in its ninth year. Raids were also conducted in Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Denver, Knoxville, Los Angeles, Milwaukee, New Orleasn, Omaha, Pittsburgh, Portland, Sacramento, San Diego and Seattle. Nationally, more than 149 underage trafficking victims were recovered and 150 suspected pimps were arrested, the FBI said. The youngest victim rescued was 12, three were transgender and three were males. Operation Cross Country is part of the FBIs Innocence Lost national initiative, which began in 2003. Since the program began, more than 4,800 children have been recovered from underage prostitution, and prosecutors have obtained more than 2,000 convictions, including at least 15 that have resulted in life sentences. » Photo via Flickr",0,8,5
1281,"More than 40 percent of Dearborn residents are Arab Americans, and the majority of them are Muslim. As global anxiety over Islamic terrorism increases, some Dearborn residents say they dont feel safe in their hometown. (Photo by The Bs/Flickr) _____________________ This story has been updated: The FBI said Friday that an alleged attack on an Arab American man who was speaking Arabic to his children in a Dearborn grocery store earlier this month was not a hate crime. Although abusive language may have been exchanged as the altercation progressed, we have no credible statements or evidence, including the limited video available, to substantiate the claim that the altercation occurred due to the religion, race or ethnicity of any of the combatants, Dearborn police said in a statement. The Dearborn Police Department is continuing its investigation, but said witness statements offer conflicting accounts of the alleged altercation. Some of the witnesses have been active on social media, and have given reports which contradict the version of events as described by all combatants, authorities said. This type of situation could have been totally avoided had cooler heads prevailed, Dearborn Police Chief Ronald Haddad said. This was an isolated incident that is uncommon at the store in question.. Our earlier report: Federal authorities are weighing whether to file hate charges against two Warren men who allegedly assaulted a man who was speaking Arabic at a grocery store in Dearborn, which has the highest concentration of Arab Americans in the United States. That seemed to have been the trigger, Mayor John OReilly Jr. said of the Feb. 12 attack on the Arab American man at the Kroger store in Dearborn on Feb. 12, the Detroit Free Press reports. The man, who wasnt named, was speaking Arabic with his children and they took umbrage at that, OReilly said. More than 40 percent of Dearborn residents are Arab American, and the majority of them are Muslims. The alleged assault raised concerns among Arab Americans about their safety during a time of increased global anxiety over Islamic terrorism, and, closer to home, the shooting deaths of three Arab-American Muslim students in North Carolina on Feb. 10. I hear ISIS, I hear terrorist, I hear go back to your country and raghead,  Kathy Bazzi, 60, of Dearborn told the Free Press last week. A lifelong Dearborn resident who converted to Islam and wears a hijab, the traditional Islamic headscarf worn by many Muslim women, Bazzi witnessed the encounter between the man and two white men. The alleged attack occurred when one of the men taunted the Arab American mans daughter for wearing a hijab, and made disparaging remarks about Muslims and ISIS, the acronym for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. Then, all of a sudden, the man is punching this Arabic man, fists started flying, Bazzi said. She said the two white men threw the first punches, but appeared to take the brunt of the attack. None of the three was seriously injured, OReilly said. Mayor: Impossible Not to Have an Emotional Reaction OReilly said there is no evidence that the men who allegedly attacked the man are part of a larger group targeting local Muslims. This was a spur of the moment event, OReilly said. The alleged perpetrators are not part of any organization. Theres no evidence that they came to Dearborn with any intent. Local tensions are symptomatic of growing fear nationally about the threat posed by ISIS. A Gallup poll published last week found that 84 percent of Americans view terrorism as the gravest threat to U.S. security. Its impossible not to have an emotional reaction to...ISIS, OReilly said. Its concerning to everybody – including everyone in our community – this total disregard for life and for the rights of people, were seeing on TV. Its an emotional time. Bazzi said the tension locally is getting worse every day. I dont like to travel outside my comfort zone. When I leave my house, Im starting to look over my shoulder when I go places, she said. Its a terrible feeling. I just dont feel secure, even in my own city. I grew up in Dearborn and lived here my whole life. FBI: Hate Crimes Against Muslims Underreported The FBI said 160 American Muslims were victimized in hate crimes each year between 2011 and 2013, but qualified the number as significantly underreported, The Washington Post said. A Pew Research Center poll in 2011 found that 6 percent of American Muslims said they had been threatened or attacked. There were about 2.6 million American Muslims at the time, and the poll results suggest that 156,000 of them may have been victims of hate crimes. The Department of Justice said in 2013 that two of every three hate crimes are not reported, especially among American Muslims, who have been targeted in local and federal police investigations simply because of their religion in the 14 years since the 9/11 terrorist attacks. That excessive scrutiny has eroded the trust necessary for victims to report hate crimes, The Post said. The Charlie Hedbo attack in Paris has caused a spike in anti-Muslim hate rhetoric, Ibrahim Hooper, communications director at the Council on American-Islamic Relations, told Mashable. Since the attacks on the satirical magazine last month, Hooper said he has fielded and turned over to the FBI dozens and dozens of hate emails and calls and even threats. We see this being replicated all over the country as what has been termed Islamophobia takes root, he said. Mark Potok, a senior fellow at the Southern Poverty Law Center, a group that monitors hate crimes in the United States, told Mashable the actual number of hate crimes may be as much as 40 percent higher than the number reported to the FBI. Anecdotally, I dont have the slightest doubt that anti-Muslim crime and hate speech is very much on the rise, Potok said. That is a function of radical Islam being on the news recently. In addition to the Chapel Hill murders, other high profile attacks against American Muslims include one in Kansas City in December when a Somali Christian ran over and killed a 15-year-old Muslim boy; anti-Muslim graffiti sprayed on a school in Washington, DC; and a plot to blow up an Islamic center in Austin, TX. Hooper thinks hate crimes against American Muslims will continue to increase in 2015. Sometimes youll see more hate incidents, sometimes youll see more things like workplace discrimination, he said. It depends on the year. ISIS Recruiting in U.S. and Globally Osama Siblani, publisher of The Arab American News in Dearborn, told WJBK-TV hes seen an uptick in threats against American Muslims as ISIS steps up recruitment efforts in the United States and globally. We have people in this country ready to go and fight with ISIS. And we have people in this country who are crazy and want to kill Muslims, he said. They are putting it on Facebook and Twitter, Siblani said.Like lets burn Dearborn down because it has Muslims and Arabs, lets start by burning Dearborn down to the ground.  Earlier this week, the FBI detained Iraqi Al-Hamzah Mohammad Jawad, 29, of East Lansing as he tried to fly out of the Detroit Metropolitan Airport in Romulus to join ISIS in Iraq. » Sign up for the Dearborn Patch daily newsletter and news alerts.",0,8,5
1282,"Police have found human remains on Detroits west side and believe they are dealing with a homicide case dating several years back. Police said crews were putting up cable lines in the alley when they found the remains in the backyard of a house in the 14000 block of Ward Avenue last month on April 10. The body of a young female, believed to have been African American, was discovered and now authorities are trying to connect missing persons cases to this new development, police said Friday. Sgt. Shannon Jones said the person has likely been missing since 2017, maybe even 2016. Jones said 85% of the body was found and that the remains were not covered up or hidden when workers found them. A cadaver dog was used for the search, which located the womans skull some distance away. Police are treating it as a murder, Jones said. No identifying information was found near the remains; investigators are working off of dental records and DNA. The body was described as 5 feet 4 inches tall, plus or minus 3 inches, and several pieces of clothing was found at the scene, including a pair of womans polo leather shoes, size 8, and a pair of True Religion blue jeans, waist size 32. A black cloth belt and a blue shirt were also found at the scene.  Image via Shutterstock Subscribe to Detroit Patch for more regional news and real-time alerts.",0,8,5
1283,"Its tax time. And, while many of us hate that the government is taking too much of our paychecks, the Detroit Police warn that there may be nefarious types that would like to snitch some of our money, too. Detroit Police warned this week that residents beware and protect themselves from various schemes that arise this time of year. Here are three commons scams: IRS Imposter Scam: This scam generally involves someone pretending to be agent of the tax collection agency who is trying to assist you with your taxes or verifying your personal information. Dont fall for it. The IRS will always contact you first by mail before reaching out to you via phone. If someone does call, make sure to verify the employee and the form with the IRS by phoning agents or using the IRS.gov website. Tax ID Theft: A very common scam during tax season, and one where an imposter will try using someone elses Social Security number to get a job or file a tax return. To avoid this scam, be sure to hire a reputable tax preparer and watch for any mail that indicates a duplicate tax return has been filed. Do not click on any links that ask you to submit your Social Security number or bank account numbers. Telephone Scam: In this scam, either a real person or robocaller solicits you to share your personal information. Dont do it. Add your name to the National Do Not Call Registry, never send money, and do not provide credit card or Social Security numbers, and do not share personal information. And the scams continue to evolve and get more sophisticated. In February, the IRS warned of a scam where erroneous tax refunds were being deposited into individuals bank accounts. The refunds came from a bogus tax return getting filed that generated the tax refund. The agency said thieves, posing as agents, then would contact recipients of these refunds to return the refunds. If you feel you have been the victim of any of the scams, do not hesitate to contact police. Image via Shutterstock",0,8,5
1284,"U.S. District Judge Bernard Friedman issued a decision last night dismissing the most serious charge against two Metro Detroit doctors accused of performing female genital mutilation (FGM) procedures on as many as 100 girls. The judge dismissed the charge of conspiracy to take a minor across state lines with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, agreeing with the defenses position that even if the charges of performing the operations were proven, the actions would not constitute sexual activity. Dr. Jumana Nagarwala and Dr. Fakhruddin Attar still face other charges in the case, along with six other defendants, including some of the girls parents. In June 2017, the FBI and local authorities charged Nagarwala and Attar along with six other members of Farmington Hills Dawoodi Bohra religious community. Dawoodi Bohra are Indian Muslims, some of whom practice genital cutting on young girls as a religious rite of passage and as a way of controlling girls sexual desire. The defendants attorneys say the operations were harmless and did not involve cutting. The criminal complaint filed against the defendants by the FBI includes an interview with a 7-year-old whose court-ordered medical exam found evidence of surgery. The Minnesota girl told the FBI she could barely walk and felt the pain all the way down to her ankle after the procedure in Attars Livonia clinic. The exam found healing incisions to the girls clitoral hood and labia. Nagarwala, 44, of Northville was not employed by Attars clinic. She was an emergency room physician at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit. The defendants plan to assert religious freedom at trial. The charge of transporting minors for criminal sexual activity carried the possibility of a life sentence. After the arrests in this case, Michigan moved to make FGM a 15-year felony. At the time of the alleged crimes, the maximum penalty was five years in prison. Image via Shutterstock.",1,2,0
1285,"A veteran Detroit firefighter died Saturday of an apparent heart attack after fighting two fires with Squad 3 on the citys east side, leaving the Detroit Fire Department in grief. After he returned to the station, Kevin Ramsey, 50, said he had chest pains and felt sick to his stomach, Detroit Deputy Fire Commissioner Dave Fornell told reporters. Medics responding to a 911 call took over for colleagues who had given oxygen to and were using a defibrillator to revive Ramsey. Medics performed CPR on the way to the hospital, but were unable to revive the 20-year veteran of the Detroit Fire Department. He was pronounced dead at Detroit Receiving Hospital. Central dispatch services announced Ramseys death at 6:33 p.m. and asked for a moment of silence. Ramsey, or Rammer as he was known, had a legendary sense of humor and upbeat attitude, and his death hit everyone hard, according to Michael Nevin, the Detroit firefighters union president. Everybodys hurt, Nevin told The Detroit News. He could deal with people. He could work with anybody. Everybody in the department had a bromance with Rammer.

He was a wonderful, wonderful guy and a hell of fireman, Nevin said. This is a born-bred-raised city boy all the way. He knew the streets and he knew the people in the streets. Ramsey could have asked for an assignment in an area of the city that wasnt as busy, as many firefighters do as they near retirement, Fornell said. Instead, Rammer craved the action and remained with Squad 3, which typically goes on a minimum of five runs a day. Ramsey loved serving the city, Fornell told The Detroit News. You hate to say he died doing what he loved most, but that is the case. The first fire Ramsey fought Saturday East Outer Drive around 10 a.m. Squad 3 was dispatch again around 1:30 p.m. to Mackay Street. Ramsey began going into cardiac arrest shortly after returning to the station after the second fire, officials said. Ramsey is survived by his wife, Amy, and two stepchildren.

1286,"Two of the three defendants in the high-profile Michigan female genital mutilation case that could test limits on First Amendment religious protections were allowed bond Wednesday, despite objections from federal prosecutors. Also Wednesday, prosecutors said as many as 100 girls may have had the controversial procedure over the past dozen years.The case is the first of its kind in the United States, though female genital mutilation, or FGM, has been illegal for more than two decades. Charged are Dr. Jumana Nagarwala, 44, of Northville, and Dr. Fakhruddin Attar, 53, and his wife, Farida Attar, 50, of Farmington Hills.The three, all members of a Muslim sect known as Dawoodi Bohra, are accused of conspiring to perform the procedure on two 7-year-old girls from Minnesota. Their attorneys argue the practice is a religious ritual that is protected by the First Amendment.

Appointments outside the home to lawyers and doctors must be approved first, the Detroit Free Press reported.They also cannot live with their daughter, 9, because child-welfare officials have taken steps in Oakland County Circuit Court to terminate their parental rights, The Detroit News reported. A similar parental rights termination petition has been filed against Nagarwala in Wayne County Circuit Court, and she remains in jail without bond.Assistant U.S. Attorney Sara Woodward said FGM may be widespread than prosecutors originally suspected. Calling it a conservative estimate, Woodward said that in addition to the Minnesota girls named in the historic genital mutilation case, 100 other girls may have been subjected to the procedure. Due to the secretive nature of this procedure, we are unlikely to ever know how many children were cut by Dr. Nagarwala, Woodward said. However, Mary Chartier, Fakhruddin Attars lawyer, told reporters with The Detroit News and other media that the government is overstating the case. I think the government has overstated so many aspects of this case and this is another example, Chartier told reporters.Chartier and Nagarwalas attorney, Shannon Smith, have said the girls at the center of the case werent cut, as the government alleges, and that the procedure is a constitutionally protected religious ritual.That defense may take the case into new First Amendment territory, according to legal scholars. Religious freedom isnt an absolute right in the United States, and courts have consistently ruled again Jehovahs Witness and Christian Scientist families who have argued the First Amendment gives them the right to refuse medical care for their children. It is hard for me to imagine any court accepting the religious freedom defense given the harm thats being dealt in this case, First Amendment expert Erwin Chemerinsky, one of the nations leading constitutional law scholars and dean of the law school at the University of California at Irvine, recently told the Detroit Free Press. You dont have the right to impose harm on others in practicing your religion. Genital mutilation, intended to curb girls and womens sexual pleasure and promiscuity, has been internationally condemned as a violation of their human rights by the World Health Organization, UNICEF and the UN Population Fund, among other organizations. Serious health consequences can result, including chronic pain, infections, infertility, complications during childbirth and psychological problems. Photo via Shutterstock",1,2,0
